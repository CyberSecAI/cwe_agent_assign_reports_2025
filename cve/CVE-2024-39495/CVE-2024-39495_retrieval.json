In gb_interface_create, &intf->mode_switch_completion is bound with gb_interface_mode_switch_work. Then it will be started by gb_interface_request_mode_switch. Here is the relevant code. if (!queue_work(system_long_wq, &intf->mode_switch_work)) { ... } If we call gb_interface_release to make cleanup, there may be an unfinished work. This function will call kfree to free the object intf. However, if gb_interface_mode_switch_work is scheduled to run after kfree, it may cause **use-after-free** error as gb_interface_mode_switch_work will use the object intf. The possible execution flow that may lead to the issue is as follows CPU0 CPU1 | gb_interface_create | gb_interface_request_mode_switch gb_interface_release | kfree(intf) (free) | | gb_interface_mode_switch_work | mutex_lock(&intf->mutex) (use) Fix it by canceling the work before kfree.', key_phrases={'rootcause': 'race condition', 'weakness': 'use-after-free', 'impact': '', 'vector': '', 'attacker': '', 'product': 'Linux kernel', 'version': '', 'component': 'greybus'}, reference_content=\"Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\\n\\n**Root Cause:**\\n\\n- A race condition exists in the `gb_interface_release` function of the Linux kernel's Greybus driver.\\n- The `gb_interface_release` function frees the `intf` object using `kfree(intf)`.\\n- Simultaneously, a worker thread, `gb_interface_mode_switch_work`, might still be scheduled to run after `intf` is freed.\\n- This worker thread attempts to access members of the freed `intf` object (specifically, `intf->mutex`), leading to a use-after-free (UAF) vulnerability.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\\n\\n- **Use-After-Free (UAF):** The primary vulnerability is a UAF that occurs when the `gb_interface_mode_switch_work` attempts to access the `intf` object after it has been freed.\\n- **Race Condition:** The UAF is triggered by a race condition between the `gb_interface_release` function and the scheduling of the `gb_interface_mode_switch_work` work item.\\n\\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\\n\\n- **Kernel Crash:** The most likely impact is a kernel crash due to the invalid memory access from the UAF, leading to denial of service.\\n- **Potential for Privilege Escalation:** While not explicitly mentioned, UAF vulnerabilities can sometimes be leveraged for more severe exploits, like arbitrary code execution with kernel privileges.\\n\\n**Attack Vectors:**\\n\\n- An attacker needs to trigger the following sequence of events:\\n    1. Call `gb_interface_create` to create a Greybus interface.\\n    2. Call `gb_interface_request_mode_switch` to schedule the `gb_interface_mode_switch_work`.\\n    3. Call `gb_interface_release` to initiate the cleanup, leading to the `intf` object being freed.\\n    4. Ensure `gb_interface_mode_switch_work` is scheduled to run after `kfree(intf)`.\\n\\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\\n\\n- The attacker needs to have the ability to interact with the Greybus driver to call the described functions. This may require a user with certain privileges or a specific device that uses the Greybus framework.\\n- They need to be able to cause the described race condition by controlling the execution of the two different processes (process calling release and the worker thread).\\n\\n**Mitigation:**\\n\\nThe provided patch addresses the issue by adding the line `cancel_work_sync(&intf->mode_switch_work);` before `kfree(intf);` in the `gb_interface_release` function. This cancels the potentially pending work item before the object is freed, preventing the UAF.\\n\\nIn summary, this is a use-after-free vulnerability caused by a race condition in the Greybus driver that can lead to a kernel crash. The fix ensures that the work item is cancelled before the object is freed.\", similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {}, 'top_cwes_by_threshold': {}}}, similarity_summary=SimilarityInsight(consensus_cwe='', top_cwes=[], confidence_levels={}, total_samples=0), analysis='', analysis_with_relationships='', criticism='', resolution='', relevant_cwes=[{'metadata': {'doc_id': '362', 'name': \"Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\", 'source': 'alternate_terms', 'original_match': 'AlternateTerms: Race Condition', 'match_reason': 'exact_match_whole_phrase'}, 'similarity': 1000.0, 'alternate_term_match': True}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '416', 'name': 'Use After Free', 'source': 'alternate_terms', 'original_match': 'AlternateTerms: Use-After-Free', 'match_reason': 'exact_match_whole_phrase'}, 'similarity': 1000.0, 'alternate_term_match': True}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '415', 'name': 'Double Free', 'source': 'sparse'}, 'similarity': np.float64(633.7845283958561)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '667', 'name': 'Improper Locking', 'source': 'sparse'}, 'similarity': np.float64(632.5770480919639)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '367', 'name': 'Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition', 'source': 'sparse'}, 'similarity': np.float64(586.8631403808965)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '366', 'name': 'Race Condition within a Thread', 'type': 'Base', 'original_content': 'If two threads of execution use a resource simultaneously, there exists the possibility that resources may be used while invalid, in turn making the state of execution undefined.', 'keyphrase_source': 'weakness:use-after-free', 'source': 'dense', 'mapping_notes': {'usage': 'Allowed', 'rationale': 'This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.', 'comments': \"Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

In affected versions the implementation for `tf.raw_ops.BoostedTreesCreateEnsemble` can result in a use after free error if an attacker supplies specially crafted arguments. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/f24faa153ad31a4b51578f8181d3aaab77a1ddeb/tensorflow/core/kernels/boosted_trees/resource_ops.cc#L55) uses a reference counted resource and decrements the refcount if the initialization fails, as it should. However, when the code was written, the resource was represented as a naked pointer but later refactoring has changed it to be a smart pointer. Thus, when the pointer leaves the scope, a subsequent `free`-ing of the resource occurs, but this fails to take into account that the refcount has already reached 0, thus the resource has been already freed. During this double-free process, members of the resource object are accessed for cleanup but they are invalid as the entire resource has been freed. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 5ecec9c6fbdbc6be03295685190a45e7eee726ab. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2020-14123: There is a pointer double free vulnerability in Some MIUI Services.

All processes/threads are expected to follow the same steps for locking.

The fix for CVE-2019-16770 was incomplete. The original fix only protected existing connections that had already been accepted from having their requests starved by greedy persistent-connections saturating all threads in the same process. However, new connections may still be starved by greedy persistent-connections saturating all threads in all processes in the cluster. A `puma` server which received more concurrent `keep-alive` connections than the server had threads in its threadpool would service only a subset of connections, denying service to the unserved connections. This problem has been fixed in `puma` 4.3.8 and 5.3.1. Setting `queue_requests false` also fixes the issue. This is not advised when using `puma` without a reverse proxy, such as `nginx` or `apache`, because you will open yourself to slow client attacks (e.g. slowloris). The fix is very small and a git patch is available for those using unsupported versions of Puma.\n\n- CVE-2021-4001: A race condition was found in the Linux kernel's ebpf verifier between bpf_map_update_elem and bpf_map_freeze due to a missing lock in kernel/bpf/syscall.c.

The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.\n\n- CVE-2022-0280: A race condition vulnerability exists in the QuickClean feature of McAfee Total Protection for Windows prior to 16.0.43 that allows a local user to gain privilege elevation and perform an arbitrary file delete. This could lead to sensitive files being deleted and potentially cause denial of service. This attack exploits the way symlinks are created and how the product works with them.\n\n- CVE-2022-0915: There is a Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition Vulnerability in Logitech Sync for Windows prior to 2.4.574. Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may escalate the permission to the system user.\n\n- CVE-2022-21198: Time-of-check time-of-use race condition in the BIOS firmware for some Intel(R) Processors may allow a privileged user to potentially enable escalation of privilege via local access.\n\n- CVE-2022-23651: b2-sdk-python is a python library to access cloud storage provided by backblaze. Linux and Mac releases of the SDK version 1.14.0 and below contain a key disclosure vulnerability that, in certain conditions, can be exploited by local attackers through a time-of-check-time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition. SDK users of the SqliteAccountInfo format are vulnerable while users of the InMemoryAccountInfo format are safe. The SqliteAccountInfo saves API keys (and bucket name-to-id mapping) in a local database file ($XDG_CONFIG_HOME/b2/account_info, ~/.b2_account_info or a user-defined path). When first created, the file is world readable and is (typically a few milliseconds) later altered to be private to the user. If the directory containing the file is readable by a local attacker then during the brief period between file creation and permission modification, a local attacker can race to open the file and maintain a handle to it. This allows the local attacker to read the contents after the file after the sensitive information has been saved to it. Consumers of this SDK who rely on it to save data using SqliteAccountInfo class should upgrade to the latest version of the SDK. Those who believe a local user might have opened a handle using this race condition, should remove the affected database files and regenerate all application keys. Users should upgrade to b2-sdk-python 1.14.1 or later.\n\n- CVE-2022-23653: B2 Command Line Tool is the official command line tool for the backblaze cloud storage service. Linux and Mac releases of the B2 command-line tool version 3.2.0 and below contain a key disclosure vulnerability that, in certain conditions, can be exploited by local attackers through a time-of-check-time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition. The command line tool saves API keys (and bucket name-to-id mapping) in a local database file (`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/b2/account_info`, `~/.b2_account_info` or a user-defined path) when `b2 authorize-account` is first run. This happens regardless of whether a valid key is provided or not. When first created, the file is world readable and is (typically a few milliseconds) later altered to be private to the user. If the directory is readable by a local attacker and the user did not yet run `b2 authorize-account` then during the brief period between file creation and permission modification, a local attacker can race to open the file and maintain a handle to it. This allows the local attacker to read the contents after the file after the sensitive information has been saved to it. Users that have not yet run `b2 authorize-account` should upgrade to B2 Command-Line Tool v3.2.1 before running it. Users that have run `b2 authorize-account` are safe if at the time of the file creation no other local users had read access to the local configuration file. Users that have run `b2 authorize-account` where the designated path could be opened by another local user should upgrade to B2 Command-Line Tool v3.2.1 and remove the database and regenerate all application keys. Note that `b2 clear-account` does not remove the database file and it should not be used to ensure that all open handles to the file are invalidated. If B2 Command-Line Tool cannot be upgraded to v3.2.1 due to a dependency conflict, a binary release can be used instead. Alternatively a new version could be installed within a virtualenv, or the permissions can be changed to prevent local users from opening the database file.\n\n- CVE-2022-25165: An issue was discovered in Amazon AWS VPN Client 2.0.0. A TOCTOU race condition exists during the validation of VPN configuration files. This allows parameters outside of the AWS VPN Client allow list to be injected into the configuration file prior to the AWS VPN Client service (running as SYSTEM) processing the file. Dangerous arguments can be injected by a low-level user such as log, which allows an arbitrary destination to be specified for writing log files. This leads to an arbitrary file write as SYSTEM with partial control over the files content. This can be abused to cause an elevation of privilege or denial of service.\n\n- CVE-2022-26859: Dell BIOS contains a race condition vulnerability. A local attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious input via SMI in order to bypass security checks during SMM.\n\n- CVE-2022-28743: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition vulerability in Foscam R2C IP camera running System FW <= 1.13.1.6, and Application FW <= 2.91.2.66, allows an authenticated remote attacker with administrator permissions to execute arbitrary remote code via a malicious firmware patch. The impact of this vulnerability is that the remote attacker could gain full remote access to the IP camera and the underlying Linux system with root permissions. With root access to the camera's Linux OS, an attacker could effectively change the code that is running, add backdoor access, or invade the privacy of the user by accessing the live camera stream.\n\n- CVE-2022-29800: A time-of-check-time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition vulnerability was found in networkd-dispatcher. This flaw exists because there is a certain time between the scripts being discovered and them being run. An attacker can abuse this vulnerability to replace scripts that networkd-dispatcher believes to be owned by root with ones that are not.\n\n- CVE-2022-31466: Time of Check - Time of Use (TOCTOU) vulnerability in Quick Heal Total Security prior to 12.1.1.27 allows a local attacker to achieve privilege escalation, potentially leading to deletion of system files. This is achieved through exploiting the time between detecting a file as malicious and when the action of quarantining or cleaning is performed, and using the time to replace the malicious file by a symlink.\n\n- CVE-2022-33691: A possible race condition vulnerability in score driver prior to SMR Jul-2022 Release 1 can allow local attackers to interleave malicious operations.\n\n- CVE-2022-34830: An Arm product family through 2022-06-29 has a TOCTOU Race Condition that allows non-privileged user to make improper GPU processing operations to gain access to already freed memory.\n\n- CVE-2022-34899: This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of Parallels Access 6.5.4 (39316) Agent. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target host system in order to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the Parallels service. By creating a symbolic link, an attacker can abuse the service to execute a file. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-16134.\n\n- CVE-2022-3590: WordPress is affected by an unauthenticated blind SSRF in the pingback feature. Because of a TOCTOU race condition between the validation checks and the HTTP request, attackers can reach internal hosts that are explicitly forbidden.\n\n- CVE-2022-45842: Unauth. Race Condition vulnerability in WP ULike Plugin <= 4.6.4 on WordPress allows attackers to increase/decrease rating scores. \n\n- CVE-2022-1537: file.copy operations in GruntJS are vulnerable to a TOCTOU race condition leading to arbitrary file write in GitHub repository gruntjs/grunt prior to 1.5.3. This vulnerability is capable of arbitrary file writes which can lead to local privilege escalation to the GruntJS user if a lower-privileged user has write access to both source and destination directories as the lower-privileged user can create a symlink to the GruntJS user's .bashrc file or replace /etc/shadow file if the GruntJS user is root.\n\n- CVE-2022-21658: Rust is a multi-paradigm, general-purpose programming language designed for performance and safety, especially safe concurrency. The Rust Security Response WG was notified that the `std::fs::remove_dir_all` standard library function is vulnerable a race condition enabling symlink following (CWE-363). An attacker could use this security issue to trick a privileged program into deleting files and directories the attacker couldn't otherwise access or delete. Rust 1.0.0 through Rust 1.58.0 is affected by this vulnerability with 1.58.1 containing a patch. Note that the following build targets don't have usable APIs to properly mitigate the attack, and are thus still vulnerable even with a patched toolchain: macOS before version 10.10 (Yosemite) and REDOX. We recommend everyone to update to Rust 1.58.1 as soon as possible, especially people developing programs expected to run in privileged contexts (including system daemons and setuid binaries), as those have the highest risk of being affected by this. Note that adding checks in your codebase before calling remove_dir_all will not mitigate the vulnerability, as they would also be vulnerable to race conditions like remove_dir_all itself. The existing mitigation is working as intended outside of race conditions.\n\n- CVE-2022-23563: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. In multiple places, TensorFlow uses `tempfile.mktemp` to create temporary files. While this is acceptable in testing, in utilities and libraries it is dangerous as a different process can create the file between the check for the filename in `mktemp` and the actual creation of the file by a subsequent operation (a TOC/TOU type of weakness). In several instances, TensorFlow was supposed to actually create a temporary directory instead of a file. This logic bug is hidden away by the `mktemp` function usage. We have patched the issue in several commits, replacing `mktemp` with the safer `mkstemp`/`mkdtemp` functions, according to the usage pattern. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible.\n\n- CVE-2021-4098: Insufficient data validation in Mojo in Google Chrome prior to 96.0.4664.110 allowed a remote attacker who had compromised the renderer process to potentially perform a sandbox escape via a crafted HTML page.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-362 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-362 (ChildOf)",

This vulnerability is due to improper resource management when connection rates are high. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by opening a significant number of connections on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.\n\n- CVE-2020-15254: Crossbeam is a set of tools for concurrent programming. In crossbeam-channel before version 0.4.4, the bounded channel incorrectly assumes that `Vec::from_iter` has allocated capacity that same as the number of iterator elements. `Vec::from_iter` does not actually guarantee that and may allocate extra memory. The destructor of the `bounded` channel reconstructs `Vec` from the raw pointer based on the incorrect assumes described above. This is unsound and causing deallocation with the incorrect capacity when `Vec::from_iter` has allocated different sizes with the number of iterator elements. This has been fixed in crossbeam-channel 0.4.4.\n\n- CVE-2020-27827: A flaw was found in multiple versions of OpenvSwitch. Specially crafted LLDP packets can cause memory to be lost when allocating data to handle specific optional TLVs, potentially causing a denial of service.

FreeSWITCH prior to version 1.10.7 is susceptible to Denial of Service via SIP flooding. When flooding FreeSWITCH with SIP messages, it was observed that after a number of seconds the process was killed by the operating system due to memory exhaustion. By abusing this vulnerability, an attacker is able to crash any FreeSWITCH instance by flooding it with SIP messages, leading to Denial of Service. The attack does not require authentication and can be carried out over UDP, TCP or TLS. This issue was patched in version 1.10.7.\n\n- CVE-2021-31261: The gf_hinter_track_new function in GPAC 1.0.1 allows attackers to read memory via a crafted file in the MP4Box command.\n\n- CVE-2020-22844: A buffer overflow in Mikrotik RouterOS 6.47 allows unauthenticated attackers to cause a denial of service (DOS) via crafted SMB requests.\n\n- CVE-2021-40008: There is a memory leak vulnerability in CloudEngine 12800 V200R019C00SPC800, CloudEngine 5800 V200R019C00SPC800, CloudEngine 6800 V200R019C00SPC800 and CloudEngine 7800 V200R019C00SPC800. The software does not sufficiently track and release allocated memory while parse a series of crafted binary messages, which could consume remaining memory. Successful exploit could cause memory exhaust.\n\n- CVE-2022-20046: In Bluetooth, there is a possible memory corruption due to a logic error. This could lead to local denial of service with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation. Patch ID: ALPS06142410; Issue ID: ALPS06142410.\n\n- CVE-2021-33437: An issue was discovered in mjs (mJS: Restricted JavaScript engine), ES6 (JavaScript version 6). There are memory leaks in frozen_cb() in mjs.c.\n\n- CVE-2021-42197: An issue was discovered in swftools through 20201222 through a memory leak in the swftools when swfdump is used. It allows an attacker to cause code execution.\n\n- CVE-2022-0854: A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel\u2019s DMA subsystem, in the way a user calls DMA_FROM_DEVICE. This flaw allows a local user to read random memory from the kernel space.\n\n- CVE-2022-22155: An Uncontrolled Resource Consumption vulnerability in the handling of IPv6 neighbor state change events in Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an adjacent attacker to cause a memory leak in the Flexible PIC Concentrator (FPC) of an ACX5448 router. The continuous flapping of an IPv6 neighbor with specific timing will cause the FPC to run out of resources, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition. Once the condition occurs, further packet processing will be impacted, creating a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition, requiring a manual PFE restart to restore service.

A bug was found in containerd's CRI implementation where a user can exhaust memory on the host. In the CRI stream server, a goroutine is launched to handle terminal resize events if a TTY is requested. If the user's process fails to launch due to, for example, a faulty command, the goroutine will be stuck waiting to send without a receiver, resulting in a memory leak. Kubernetes and crictl can both be configured to use containerd's CRI implementation and the stream server is used for handling container IO. This bug has been fixed in containerd 1.6.12 and 1.5.16. Users should update to these versions to resolve the issue. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that only trusted images and commands are used and that only trusted users have permissions to execute commands in running containers. \n\n- CVE-2021-42522: There is a Information Disclosure vulnerability in anjuta/plugins/document-manager/anjuta-bookmarks.c.

          "matched_text": "CWE-364: Signal Handler Race Condition\n\nType: Base\n\nStatus: Incomplete\n\nDescription:\n\nThe product uses a signal handler that introduces a race condition.\n\nExtended Details:\n\n\n\nRace conditions frequently occur in signal handlers, since signal handlers support asynchronous actions. These race conditions have a variety of root causes and symptoms. Attackers may be able to exploit a signal handler race condition to cause the product state to be corrupted, possibly leading to a denial of service or even code execution.\n\n\nThese issues occur when non-reentrant functions, or state-sensitive actions occur in the signal handler, where they may be called at any time. These behaviors can violate assumptions being made by the \"regular\" code that is interrupted, or by other signal handlers that may also be invoked. If these functions are called at an inopportune moment - such as while a non-reentrant function is already running - memory corruption could occur that may be exploitable for code execution. Another signal race condition commonly found occurs when free is called within a signal handler, resulting in a double free and therefore a write-what-where condition. Even if a given pointer is set to NULL after it has been freed, a race condition still exists between the time the memory was freed and the pointer was set to NULL. This is especially problematic if the same signal handler has been set for more than one signal -- since it means that the signal handler itself may be reentered.\n\n\nThere are several known behaviors related to signal handlers that have received the label of \"signal handler race condition\":\n\n\n  - Shared state (e.g. global data or static variables) that are accessible to both a signal handler and \"regular\" code\n\n  - Shared state between a signal handler and other signal handlers\n\n  - Use of non-reentrant functionality within a signal handler - which generally implies that shared state is being used. For example, malloc() and free() are non-reentrant because they may use global or static data structures for managing memory, and they are indirectly used by innocent-seeming functions such as syslog(); these functions could be exploited for memory corruption and, possibly, code execution.\n\n  - Association of the same signal handler function with multiple signals - which might imply shared state, since the same code and resources are accessed. For example, this can be a source of double-free and use-after-free weaknesses.\n\n  - Use of setjmp and longjmp, or other mechanisms that prevent a signal handler from returning control back to the original functionality\n\n  - While not technically a race condition, some signal handlers are designed to be called at most once, and being called more than once can introduce security problems, even when there are not any concurrent calls to the signal handler. This can be a source of double-free and use-after-free weaknesses.\n\nSignal handler vulnerabilities are often classified based on the absence of a specific protection mechanism, although this style of classification is discouraged in CWE because programmers often have a choice of several different mechanisms for addressing the weakness. Such protection mechanisms may preserve exclusivity of access to the shared resource, and behavioral atomicity for the relevant code:\n\n  - Avoiding shared state\n\n  - Using synchronization in the signal handler\n\n  - Using synchronization in the regular code\n\n  - Disabling or masking other signals, which provides atomicity (which effectively ensures exclusivity)\n\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-1999-0035: Signal handler does not disable other signal handlers, allowing it to be interrupted, causing other functionality to access files/etc. with raised privileges\n\n- CVE-2001-0905: Attacker can send a signal while another signal handler is already running, leading to crash or execution with root privileges\n\n- CVE-2001-1349: unsafe calls to library functions from signal handler\n\n- CVE-2004-0794: SIGURG can be used to remotely interrupt signal handler; other variants exist\n\n- CVE-2004-2259: SIGCHLD signal to FTP server can cause crash under heavy load while executing non-reentrant functions like malloc/free.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-0244: A signal handler race condition exists in the Layer 2 Address Learning Daemon (L2ALD) of Juniper Networks Junos OS due to the absence of a specific protection mechanism to avoid a race condition which may allow an attacker to bypass the storm-control feature on devices.

Some shared resource operations cannot be executed atomically; that is, multiple steps must be guaranteed to execute sequentially, without any interference by other processes. Synchronization mechanisms vary widely, but they may include locking, mutexes, and semaphores.

In affected versions of Redis an integer overflow bug in 32-bit Redis version 4.0 or newer could be exploited to corrupt the heap and potentially result with remote code execution. Redis 4.0 or newer uses a configurable limit for the maximum supported bulk input size. By default, it is 512MB which is a safe value for all platforms. If the limit is significantly increased, receiving a large request from a client may trigger several integer overflow scenarios, which would result with buffer overflow and heap corruption. We believe this could in certain conditions be exploited for remote code execution. By default, authenticated Redis users have access to all configuration parameters and can therefore use the \u201cCONFIG SET proto-max-bulk-len\u201d to change the safe default, making the system vulnerable. **This problem only affects 32-bit Redis (on a 32-bit system, or as a 32-bit executable running on a 64-bit system).** The problem is fixed in version 6.2, and the fix is back ported to 6.0.11 and 5.0.11. Make sure you use one of these versions if you are running 32-bit Redis. An additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the redis-server executable is to prevent clients from directly executing `CONFIG SET`: Using Redis 6.0 or newer, ACL configuration can be used to block the command. Using older versions, the `rename-command` configuration directive can be used to rename the command to a random string unknown to users, rendering it inaccessible. Please note that this workaround may have an additional impact on users or operational systems that expect `CONFIG SET` to behave in certain ways.\n\n- CVE-2021-21807: An integer overflow vulnerability exists in the DICOM parse_dicom_meta_info functionality of Accusoft ImageGear 19.9.

Remote code execution might be a slight possibility.\n\n- CVE-2021-43784: runc is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers on Linux according to the OCI specification. In runc, netlink is used internally as a serialization system for specifying the relevant container configuration to the `C` portion of the code (responsible for the based namespace setup of containers). In all versions of runc prior to 1.0.3, the encoder did not handle the possibility of an integer overflow in the 16-bit length field for the byte array attribute type, meaning that a large enough malicious byte array attribute could result in the length overflowing and the attribute contents being parsed as netlink messages for container configuration. This vulnerability requires the attacker to have some control over the configuration of the container and would allow the attacker to bypass the namespace restrictions of the container by simply adding their own netlink payload which disables all namespaces. The main users impacted are those who allow untrusted images with untrusted configurations to run on their machines (such as with shared cloud infrastructure). runc version 1.0.3 contains a fix for this bug. As a workaround, one may try disallowing untrusted namespace paths from your container. It should be noted that untrusted namespace paths would allow the attacker to disable namespace protections entirely even in the absence of this bug.\n\n- CVE-2021-36155: LengthPrefixedMessageReader in gRPC Swift 1.1.0 and earlier allocates buffers of arbitrary length, which allows remote attackers to cause uncontrolled resource consumption and deny service.\n\n- CVE-2020-28009: Exim 4 before 4.94.2 allows Integer Overflow to Buffer Overflow because get_stdinput allows unbounded reads that are accompanied by unbounded increases in a certain size variable.

Integer overflow in matroskademux element in gst_matroska_decompress_data function which causes a segfault, or could cause a heap overwrite, depending on libc and OS. Depending on the libc used, and the underlying OS capabilities, it could be just a segfault or a heap overwrite. If the libc uses mmap for large chunks, and the OS supports mmap, then it is just a segfault (because the realloc before the integer overflow will use mremap to reduce the size of the chunk, and it will start to write to unmapped memory). However, if using a libc implementation that does not use mmap, or if the OS does not support mmap while using libc, then this could result in a heap overwrite.\n\n- CVE-2022-1923: DOS / potential heap overwrite in mkv demuxing using bzip decompression. Integer overflow in matroskademux element in bzip decompression function which causes a segfault, or could cause a heap overwrite, depending on libc and OS. Depending on the libc used, and the underlying OS capabilities, it could be just a segfault or a heap overwrite.

Prior to versions 0.29.0.gfm.3 and 0.28.3.gfm.21, an integer overflow in cmark-gfm's table row parsing `table.c:row_from_string` may lead to heap memory corruption when parsing tables who's marker rows contain more than UINT16_MAX columns. The impact of this heap corruption ranges from Information Leak to Arbitrary Code Execution depending on how and where `cmark-gfm` is used. If `cmark-gfm` is used for rendering remote user controlled markdown, this vulnerability may lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) in applications employing affected versions of the `cmark-gfm` library. This vulnerability has been patched in the following cmark-gfm versions 0.29.0.gfm.3 and 0.28.3.gfm.21. A workaround is available. The vulnerability exists in the table markdown extensions of cmark-gfm. Disabling the table extension will prevent this vulnerability from being triggered.\n\n- CVE-2022-24795: yajl-ruby is a C binding to the YAJL JSON parsing and generation library. The 1.x branch and the 2.x branch of `yajl` contain an integer overflow which leads to subsequent heap memory corruption when dealing with large (~2GB) inputs. The reallocation logic at `yajl_buf.c#L64` may result in the `need` 32bit integer wrapping to 0 when `need` approaches a value of 0x80000000 (i.e. ~2GB of data), which results in a reallocation of buf->alloc into a small heap chunk. These integers are declared as `size_t` in the 2.x branch of `yajl`, which practically prevents the issue from triggering on 64bit platforms, however this does not preclude this issue triggering on 32bit builds on which `size_t` is a 32bit integer. Subsequent population of this under-allocated heap chunk is based on the original buffer size, leading to heap memory corruption. This vulnerability mostly impacts process availability. Maintainers believe exploitation for arbitrary code execution is unlikely. A patch is available and anticipated to be part of yajl-ruby version 1.4.2. As a workaround, avoid passing large inputs to YAJL.\n\n- CVE-2022-25291: An integer overflow in WatchGuard Firebox and XTM appliances allows an authenticated remote attacker to trigger a heap-based buffer overflow and potentially execute arbitrary code by initiating a firmware update with a malicious upgrade image.

In versions before 6.2.0, the Fault Tolerant feature of Azure RTOS FileX includes integer under and overflows which may be exploited to achieve buffer overflow and modify memory contents. When a valid log file with correct ID and checksum is detected by the `_fx_fault_tolerant_enable` function an attempt to recover the previous failed write operation is taken by call of `_fx_fault_tolerant_apply_logs`. This function iterates through the log entries and performs required recovery operations. When properly crafted a log including entries of type `FX_FAULT_TOLERANT_DIR_LOG_TYPE` may be utilized to introduce unexpected behavior. This issue has been patched in version 6.2.0. A workaround to fix line 218 in fx_fault_tolerant_apply_logs.c is documented in the GHSA.\n\n- CVE-2022-41318: A buffer over-read was discovered in libntlmauth in Squid 2.5 through 5.6.

If an attacker can force the function to fail or otherwise return a value that is not expected, then the subsequent program logic could lead to a vulnerability, because the product is not in a state that the programmer assumes. For example, if the program calls a function to drop privileges but does not check the return code to ensure that privileges were successfully dropped, then the program will continue to operate with the higher privileges.\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-17533: Chain: unchecked return value (CWE-252) of some functions for policy enforcement leads to authorization bypass (CWE-862)\n\n- CVE-2020-6078: Chain: The return value of a function returning a pointer is not checked for success (CWE-252) resulting in the later use of an uninitialized variable (CWE-456) and a null pointer dereference (CWE-476)\n\n- CVE-2019-15900: Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).\n\n- CVE-2007-3798: Unchecked return value leads to resultant integer overflow and code execution.\n\n- CVE-2006-4447: Program does not check return value when invoking functions to drop privileges, which could leave users with higher privileges than expected by forcing those functions to fail.\n\n- CVE-2006-2916: Program does not check return value when invoking functions to drop privileges, which could leave users with higher privileges than expected by forcing those functions to fail.\n\n- CVE-2008-5183: chain: unchecked return value can lead to NULL dereference\n\n- CVE-2010-0211: chain: unchecked return value (CWE-252) leads to free of invalid, uninitialized pointer (CWE-824).\n\n- CVE-2017-6964: Linux-based device mapper encryption program does not check the return value of setuid and setgid allowing attackers to execute code with unintended privileges.\n\n- CVE-2002-1372: Chain: Return values of file/socket operations are not checked (CWE-252), allowing resultant consumption of file descriptors (CWE-772).\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-28875: In the standard library in Rust before 1.50.0, read_to_end() does not validate the return value from Read in an unsafe context. This bug could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n- CVE-2021-21217: Uninitialized data in PDFium in Google Chrome prior to 90.0.4430.72 allowed a remote attacker to obtain potentially sensitive information from process memory via a crafted PDF file.\n\n- CVE-2021-21219: Uninitialized data in PDFium in Google Chrome prior to 90.0.4430.72 allowed a remote attacker to obtain potentially sensitive information from process memory via a crafted PDF file.\n\n- CVE-2021-3673: A vulnerability was found in Radare2 in version 5.3.1. Improper input validation when reading a crafted LE binary can lead to resource exhaustion and DoS.\n\n- CVE-2021-39643: In ic_startRetrieveEntryValue of acropora/app/identity/ic.c, there is a possible bypass of defense-in-depth due to missing validation of the return value. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-195573629References: N/A\n\n- CVE-2021-0155: Unchecked return value in the BIOS firmware for some Intel(R) Processors may allow a privileged user to potentially enable information disclosure via local access.\n\n- CVE-2021-32845: HyperKit is a toolkit for embedding hypervisor capabilities in an application. In versions 0.20210107 and prior of HyperKit, the implementation of `qnotify` at `pci_vtrnd_notify` fails to check the return value of `vq_getchain`. This leads to `struct iovec iov;` being uninitialized and used to read memory in `len = (int) read(sc->vrsc_fd, iov.iov_base, iov.iov_len);` when an attacker is able to make `vq_getchain` fail. This issue may lead to a guest crashing the host causing a denial of service and, under certain circumstance, memory corruption. This issue is fixed in commit 41272a980197917df8e58ff90642d14dec8fe948.\n\n- CVE-2021-40401: A use-after-free vulnerability exists in the RS-274X aperture definition tokenization functionality of Gerbv 2.7.0 and dev (commit b5f1eacd) and Gerbv forked 2.7.1. A specially-crafted gerber file can lead to code execution. An attacker can provide a malicious file to trigger this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2022-25718: Cryptographic issue in WLAN due to improper check on return value while authentication handshake in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer Electronics Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon IoT, Snapdragon Mobile, Snapdragon Voice & Music, Snapdragon Wearables, Snapdragon Wired Infrastructure and Networking\n\n- CVE-2021-34405: NVIDIA Linux distributions contain a vulnerability in TrustZone\u2019s TEE_Malloc function, where an unchecked return value causing a null pointer dereference may lead to denial of service.\n\n- CVE-2022-0907: Unchecked Return Value to NULL Pointer Dereference in tiffcrop in libtiff 4.3.0 allows attackers to cause a denial-of-service via a crafted tiff file. For users that compile libtiff from sources, the fix is available with commit f2b656e2.\n\n- CVE-2022-22231: An Unchecked Return Value to NULL Pointer Dereference vulnerability in Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).

            "extended_description": "\n\nRace conditions frequently occur in signal handlers, since signal handlers support asynchronous actions. These race conditions have a variety of root causes and symptoms. Attackers may be able to exploit a signal handler race condition to cause the product state to be corrupted, possibly leading to a denial of service or even code execution.\n\n\nThese issues occur when non-reentrant functions, or state-sensitive actions occur in the signal handler, where they may be called at any time. These behaviors can violate assumptions being made by the \"regular\" code that is interrupted, or by other signal handlers that may also be invoked. If these functions are called at an inopportune moment - such as while a non-reentrant function is already running - memory corruption could occur that may be exploitable for code execution. Another signal race condition commonly found occurs when free is called within a signal handler, resulting in a double free and therefore a write-what-where condition. Even if a given pointer is set to NULL after it has been freed, a race condition still exists between the time the memory was freed and the pointer was set to NULL. This is especially problematic if the same signal handler has been set for more than one signal -- since it means that the signal handler itself may be reentered.\n\n\nThere are several known behaviors related to signal handlers that have received the label of \"signal handler race condition\":\n\n\n  - Shared state (e.g. global data or static variables) that are accessible to both a signal handler and \"regular\" code\n\n  - Shared state between a signal handler and other signal handlers\n\n  - Use of non-reentrant functionality within a signal handler - which generally implies that shared state is being used. For example, malloc() and free() are non-reentrant because they may use global or static data structures for managing memory, and they are indirectly used by innocent-seeming functions such as syslog(); these functions could be exploited for memory corruption and, possibly, code execution.\n\n  - Association of the same signal handler function with multiple signals - which might imply shared state, since the same code and resources are accessed. For example, this can be a source of double-free and use-after-free weaknesses.\n\n  - Use of setjmp and longjmp, or other mechanisms that prevent a signal handler from returning control back to the original functionality\n\n  - While not technically a race condition, some signal handlers are designed to be called at most once, and being called more than once can introduce security problems, even when there are not any concurrent calls to the signal handler. This can be a source of double-free and use-after-free weaknesses.\n\nSignal handler vulnerabilities are often classified based on the absence of a specific protection mechanism, although this style of classification is discouraged in CWE because programmers often have a choice of several different mechanisms for addressing the weakness. Such protection mechanisms may preserve exclusivity of access to the shared resource, and behavioral atomicity for the relevant code:\n\n  - Avoiding shared state\n\n  - Using synchronization in the signal handler\n\n  - Using synchronization in the regular code\n\n  - Disabling or masking other signals, which provides atomicity (which effectively ensures exclusivity)\n\n",

              "extended_description": "\n\nRace conditions frequently occur in signal handlers, since signal handlers support asynchronous actions. These race conditions have a variety of root causes and symptoms. Attackers may be able to exploit a signal handler race condition to cause the product state to be corrupted, possibly leading to a denial of service or even code execution.\n\n\nThese issues occur when non-reentrant functions, or state-sensitive actions occur in the signal handler, where they may be called at any time. These behaviors can violate assumptions being made by the \"regular\" code that is interrupted, or by other signal handlers that may also be invoked. If these functions are called at an inopportune moment - such as while a non-reentrant function is already running - memory corruption could occur that may be exploitable for code execution. Another signal race condition commonly found occurs when free is called within a signal handler, resulting in a double free and therefore a write-what-where condition. Even if a given pointer is set to NULL after it has been freed, a race condition still exists between the time the memory was freed and the pointer was set to NULL. This is especially problematic if the same signal handler has been set for more than one signal -- since it means that the signal handler itself may be reentered.\n\n\nThere are several known behaviors related to signal handlers that have received the label of \"signal handler race condition\":\n\n\n  - Shared state (e.g. global data or static variables) that are accessible to both a signal handler and \"regular\" code\n\n  - Shared state between a signal handler and other signal handlers\n\n  - Use of non-reentrant functionality within a signal handler - which generally implies that shared state is being used. For example, malloc() and free() are non-reentrant because they may use global or static data structures for managing memory, and they are indirectly used by innocent-seeming functions such as syslog(); these functions could be exploited for memory corruption and, possibly, code execution.\n\n  - Association of the same signal handler function with multiple signals - which might imply shared state, since the same code and resources are accessed. For example, this can be a source of double-free and use-after-free weaknesses.\n\n  - Use of setjmp and longjmp, or other mechanisms that prevent a signal handler from returning control back to the original functionality\n\n  - While not technically a race condition, some signal handlers are designed to be called at most once, and being called more than once can introduce security problems, even when there are not any concurrent calls to the signal handler. This can be a source of double-free and use-after-free weaknesses.\n\nSignal handler vulnerabilities are often classified based on the absence of a specific protection mechanism, although this style of classification is discouraged in CWE because programmers often have a choice of several different mechanisms for addressing the weakness. Such protection mechanisms may preserve exclusivity of access to the shared resource, and behavioral atomicity for the relevant code:\n\n  - Avoiding shared state\n\n  - Using synchronization in the signal handler\n\n  - Using synchronization in the regular code\n\n  - Disabling or masking other signals, which provides atomicity (which effectively ensures exclusivity)\n\n",

In affected versions the implementation for `tf.raw_ops.BoostedTreesCreateEnsemble` can result in a use after free error if an attacker supplies specially crafted arguments. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/f24faa153ad31a4b51578f8181d3aaab77a1ddeb/tensorflow/core/kernels/boosted_trees/resource_ops.cc#L55) uses a reference counted resource and decrements the refcount if the initialization fails, as it should. However, when the code was written, the resource was represented as a naked pointer but later refactoring has changed it to be a smart pointer. Thus, when the pointer leaves the scope, a subsequent `free`-ing of the resource occurs, but this fails to take into account that the refcount has already reached 0, thus the resource has been already freed. During this double-free process, members of the resource object are accessed for cleanup but they are invalid as the entire resource has been freed. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 5ecec9c6fbdbc6be03295685190a45e7eee726ab. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2020-14123: There is a pointer double free vulnerability in Some MIUI Services.

All processes/threads are expected to follow the same steps for locking.

The fix for CVE-2019-16770 was incomplete. The original fix only protected existing connections that had already been accepted from having their requests starved by greedy persistent-connections saturating all threads in the same process. However, new connections may still be starved by greedy persistent-connections saturating all threads in all processes in the cluster. A `puma` server which received more concurrent `keep-alive` connections than the server had threads in its threadpool would service only a subset of connections, denying service to the unserved connections. This problem has been fixed in `puma` 4.3.8 and 5.3.1. Setting `queue_requests false` also fixes the issue. This is not advised when using `puma` without a reverse proxy, such as `nginx` or `apache`, because you will open yourself to slow client attacks (e.g. slowloris). The fix is very small and a git patch is available for those using unsupported versions of Puma.\n\n- CVE-2021-4001: A race condition was found in the Linux kernel's ebpf verifier between bpf_map_update_elem and bpf_map_freeze due to a missing lock in kernel/bpf/syscall.c.

A local unprivileged user could use this flaw to bypass the checks that were introduced in response to CVE-2017-7500 and CVE-2017-7501, potentially gaining root privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.\n\n- CVE-2022-0280: A race condition vulnerability exists in the QuickClean feature of McAfee Total Protection for Windows prior to 16.0.43 that allows a local user to gain privilege elevation and perform an arbitrary file delete. This could lead to sensitive files being deleted and potentially cause denial of service. This attack exploits the way symlinks are created and how the product works with them.\n\n- CVE-2022-0915: There is a Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition Vulnerability in Logitech Sync for Windows prior to 2.4.574. Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may escalate the permission to the system user.\n\n- CVE-2022-21198: Time-of-check time-of-use race condition in the BIOS firmware for some Intel(R) Processors may allow a privileged user to potentially enable escalation of privilege via local access.\n\n- CVE-2022-23651: b2-sdk-python is a python library to access cloud storage provided by backblaze. Linux and Mac releases of the SDK version 1.14.0 and below contain a key disclosure vulnerability that, in certain conditions, can be exploited by local attackers through a time-of-check-time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition. SDK users of the SqliteAccountInfo format are vulnerable while users of the InMemoryAccountInfo format are safe. The SqliteAccountInfo saves API keys (and bucket name-to-id mapping) in a local database file ($XDG_CONFIG_HOME/b2/account_info, ~/.b2_account_info or a user-defined path). When first created, the file is world readable and is (typically a few milliseconds) later altered to be private to the user. If the directory containing the file is readable by a local attacker then during the brief period between file creation and permission modification, a local attacker can race to open the file and maintain a handle to it. This allows the local attacker to read the contents after the file after the sensitive information has been saved to it. Consumers of this SDK who rely on it to save data using SqliteAccountInfo class should upgrade to the latest version of the SDK. Those who believe a local user might have opened a handle using this race condition, should remove the affected database files and regenerate all application keys. Users should upgrade to b2-sdk-python 1.14.1 or later.\n\n- CVE-2022-23653: B2 Command Line Tool is the official command line tool for the backblaze cloud storage service. Linux and Mac releases of the B2 command-line tool version 3.2.0 and below contain a key disclosure vulnerability that, in certain conditions, can be exploited by local attackers through a time-of-check-time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition. The command line tool saves API keys (and bucket name-to-id mapping) in a local database file (`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/b2/account_info`, `~/.b2_account_info` or a user-defined path) when `b2 authorize-account` is first run. This happens regardless of whether a valid key is provided or not. When first created, the file is world readable and is (typically a few milliseconds) later altered to be private to the user. If the directory is readable by a local attacker and the user did not yet run `b2 authorize-account` then during the brief period between file creation and permission modification, a local attacker can race to open the file and maintain a handle to it. This allows the local attacker to read the contents after the file after the sensitive information has been saved to it. Users that have not yet run `b2 authorize-account` should upgrade to B2 Command-Line Tool v3.2.1 before running it. Users that have run `b2 authorize-account` are safe if at the time of the file creation no other local users had read access to the local configuration file. Users that have run `b2 authorize-account` where the designated path could be opened by another local user should upgrade to B2 Command-Line Tool v3.2.1 and remove the database and regenerate all application keys. Note that `b2 clear-account` does not remove the database file and it should not be used to ensure that all open handles to the file are invalidated. If B2 Command-Line Tool cannot be upgraded to v3.2.1 due to a dependency conflict, a binary release can be used instead. Alternatively a new version could be installed within a virtualenv, or the permissions can be changed to prevent local users from opening the database file.\n\n- CVE-2022-25165: An issue was discovered in Amazon AWS VPN Client 2.0.0. A TOCTOU race condition exists during the validation of VPN configuration files. This allows parameters outside of the AWS VPN Client allow list to be injected into the configuration file prior to the AWS VPN Client service (running as SYSTEM) processing the file. Dangerous arguments can be injected by a low-level user such as log, which allows an arbitrary destination to be specified for writing log files. This leads to an arbitrary file write as SYSTEM with partial control over the files content. This can be abused to cause an elevation of privilege or denial of service.\n\n- CVE-2022-26859: Dell BIOS contains a race condition vulnerability. A local attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious input via SMI in order to bypass security checks during SMM.\n\n- CVE-2022-28743: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition vulerability in Foscam R2C IP camera running System FW <= 1.13.1.6, and Application FW <= 2.91.2.66, allows an authenticated remote attacker with administrator permissions to execute arbitrary remote code via a malicious firmware patch. The impact of this vulnerability is that the remote attacker could gain full remote access to the IP camera and the underlying Linux system with root permissions. With root access to the camera's Linux OS, an attacker could effectively change the code that is running, add backdoor access, or invade the privacy of the user by accessing the live camera stream.\n\n- CVE-2022-29800: A time-of-check-time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition vulnerability was found in networkd-dispatcher. This flaw exists because there is a certain time between the scripts being discovered and them being run. An attacker can abuse this vulnerability to replace scripts that networkd-dispatcher believes to be owned by root with ones that are not.\n\n- CVE-2022-31466: Time of Check - Time of Use (TOCTOU) vulnerability in Quick Heal Total Security prior to 12.1.1.27 allows a local attacker to achieve privilege escalation, potentially leading to deletion of system files. This is achieved through exploiting the time between detecting a file as malicious and when the action of quarantining or cleaning is performed, and using the time to replace the malicious file by a symlink.\n\n- CVE-2022-33691: A possible race condition vulnerability in score driver prior to SMR Jul-2022 Release 1 can allow local attackers to interleave malicious operations.\n\n- CVE-2022-34830: An Arm product family through 2022-06-29 has a TOCTOU Race Condition that allows non-privileged user to make improper GPU processing operations to gain access to already freed memory.\n\n- CVE-2022-34899: This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of Parallels Access 6.5.4 (39316) Agent. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target host system in order to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the Parallels service. By creating a symbolic link, an attacker can abuse the service to execute a file. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-16134.\n\n- CVE-2022-3590: WordPress is affected by an unauthenticated blind SSRF in the pingback feature. Because of a TOCTOU race condition between the validation checks and the HTTP request, attackers can reach internal hosts that are explicitly forbidden.\n\n- CVE-2022-45842: Unauth. Race Condition vulnerability in WP ULike Plugin <= 4.6.4 on WordPress allows attackers to increase/decrease rating scores. \n\n- CVE-2022-1537: file.copy operations in GruntJS are vulnerable to a TOCTOU race condition leading to arbitrary file write in GitHub repository gruntjs/grunt prior to 1.5.3. This vulnerability is capable of arbitrary file writes which can lead to local privilege escalation to the GruntJS user if a lower-privileged user has write access to both source and destination directories as the lower-privileged user can create a symlink to the GruntJS user's .bashrc file or replace /etc/shadow file if the GruntJS user is root.\n\n- CVE-2022-21658: Rust is a multi-paradigm, general-purpose programming language designed for performance and safety, especially safe concurrency. The Rust Security Response WG was notified that the `std::fs::remove_dir_all` standard library function is vulnerable a race condition enabling symlink following (CWE-363). An attacker could use this security issue to trick a privileged program into deleting files and directories the attacker couldn't otherwise access or delete. Rust 1.0.0 through Rust 1.58.0 is affected by this vulnerability with 1.58.1 containing a patch. Note that the following build targets don't have usable APIs to properly mitigate the attack, and are thus still vulnerable even with a patched toolchain: macOS before version 10.10 (Yosemite) and REDOX. We recommend everyone to update to Rust 1.58.1 as soon as possible, especially people developing programs expected to run in privileged contexts (including system daemons and setuid binaries), as those have the highest risk of being affected by this. Note that adding checks in your codebase before calling remove_dir_all will not mitigate the vulnerability, as they would also be vulnerable to race conditions like remove_dir_all itself. The existing mitigation is working as intended outside of race conditions.\n\n- CVE-2022-23563: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. In multiple places, TensorFlow uses `tempfile.mktemp` to create temporary files. While this is acceptable in testing, in utilities and libraries it is dangerous as a different process can create the file between the check for the filename in `mktemp` and the actual creation of the file by a subsequent operation (a TOC/TOU type of weakness). In several instances, TensorFlow was supposed to actually create a temporary directory instead of a file. This logic bug is hidden away by the `mktemp` function usage. We have patched the issue in several commits, replacing `mktemp` with the safer `mkstemp`/`mkdtemp` functions, according to the usage pattern. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible.\n\n- CVE-2021-4098: Insufficient data validation in Mojo in Google Chrome prior to 96.0.4664.110 allowed a remote attacker who had compromised the renderer process to potentially perform a sandbox escape via a crafted HTML page.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-362 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-362 (ChildOf)",

This vulnerability is due to improper resource management when connection rates are high. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by opening a significant number of connections on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.\n\n- CVE-2020-15254: Crossbeam is a set of tools for concurrent programming. In crossbeam-channel before version 0.4.4, the bounded channel incorrectly assumes that `Vec::from_iter` has allocated capacity that same as the number of iterator elements. `Vec::from_iter` does not actually guarantee that and may allocate extra memory. The destructor of the `bounded` channel reconstructs `Vec` from the raw pointer based on the incorrect assumes described above. This is unsound and causing deallocation with the incorrect capacity when `Vec::from_iter` has allocated different sizes with the number of iterator elements. This has been fixed in crossbeam-channel 0.4.4.\n\n- CVE-2020-27827: A flaw was found in multiple versions of OpenvSwitch. Specially crafted LLDP packets can cause memory to be lost when allocating data to handle specific optional TLVs, potentially causing a denial of service.

A bug was found in containerd's CRI implementation where a user can exhaust memory on the host. In the CRI stream server, a goroutine is launched to handle terminal resize events if a TTY is requested. If the user's process fails to launch due to, for example, a faulty command, the goroutine will be stuck waiting to send without a receiver, resulting in a memory leak. Kubernetes and crictl can both be configured to use containerd's CRI implementation and the stream server is used for handling container IO. This bug has been fixed in containerd 1.6.12 and 1.5.16. Users should update to these versions to resolve the issue. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that only trusted images and commands are used and that only trusted users have permissions to execute commands in running containers. \n\n- CVE-2021-42522: There is a Information Disclosure vulnerability in anjuta/plugins/document-manager/anjuta-bookmarks.c. This issue was caused by the incorrect use of libxml2 API.

            "matched_text": "CWE-364: Signal Handler Race Condition\n\nType: Base\n\nStatus: Incomplete\n\nDescription:\n\nThe product uses a signal handler that introduces a race condition.\n\nExtended Details:\n\n\n\nRace conditions frequently occur in signal handlers, since signal handlers support asynchronous actions. These race conditions have a variety of root causes and symptoms. Attackers may be able to exploit a signal handler race condition to cause the product state to be corrupted, possibly leading to a denial of service or even code execution.\n\n\nThese issues occur when non-reentrant functions, or state-sensitive actions occur in the signal handler, where they may be called at any time. These behaviors can violate assumptions being made by the \"regular\" code that is interrupted, or by other signal handlers that may also be invoked. If these functions are called at an inopportune moment - such as while a non-reentrant function is already running - memory corruption could occur that may be exploitable for code execution. Another signal race condition commonly found occurs when free is called within a signal handler, resulting in a double free and therefore a write-what-where condition. Even if a given pointer is set to NULL after it has been freed, a race condition still exists between the time the memory was freed and the pointer was set to NULL. This is especially problematic if the same signal handler has been set for more than one signal -- since it means that the signal handler itself may be reentered.\n\n\nThere are several known behaviors related to signal handlers that have received the label of \"signal handler race condition\":\n\n\n  - Shared state (e.g. global data or static variables) that are accessible to both a signal handler and \"regular\" code\n\n  - Shared state between a signal handler and other signal handlers\n\n  - Use of non-reentrant functionality within a signal handler - which generally implies that shared state is being used. For example, malloc() and free() are non-reentrant because they may use global or static data structures for managing memory, and they are indirectly used by innocent-seeming functions such as syslog(); these functions could be exploited for memory corruption and, possibly, code execution.\n\n  - Association of the same signal handler function with multiple signals - which might imply shared state, since the same code and resources are accessed. For example, this can be a source of double-free and use-after-free weaknesses.\n\n  - Use of setjmp and longjmp, or other mechanisms that prevent a signal handler from returning control back to the original functionality\n\n  - While not technically a race condition, some signal handlers are designed to be called at most once, and being called more than once can introduce security problems, even when there are not any concurrent calls to the signal handler. This can be a source of double-free and use-after-free weaknesses.\n\nSignal handler vulnerabilities are often classified based on the absence of a specific protection mechanism, although this style of classification is discouraged in CWE because programmers often have a choice of several different mechanisms for addressing the weakness. Such protection mechanisms may preserve exclusivity of access to the shared resource, and behavioral atomicity for the relevant code:\n\n  - Avoiding shared state\n\n  - Using synchronization in the signal handler\n\n  - Using synchronization in the regular code\n\n  - Disabling or masking other signals, which provides atomicity (which effectively ensures exclusivity)\n\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-1999-0035: Signal handler does not disable other signal handlers, allowing it to be interrupted, causing other functionality to access files/etc. with raised privileges\n\n- CVE-2001-0905: Attacker can send a signal while another signal handler is already running, leading to crash or execution with root privileges\n\n- CVE-2001-1349: unsafe calls to library functions from signal handler\n\n- CVE-2004-0794: SIGURG can be used to remotely interrupt signal handler; other variants exist\n\n- CVE-2004-2259: SIGCHLD signal to FTP server can cause crash under heavy load while executing non-reentrant functions like malloc/free.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-0244: A signal handler race condition exists in the Layer 2 Address Learning Daemon (L2ALD) of Juniper Networks Junos OS due to the absence of a specific protection mechanism to avoid a race condition which may allow an attacker to bypass the storm-control feature on devices.

Some shared resource operations cannot be executed atomically; that is, multiple steps must be guaranteed to execute sequentially, without any interference by other processes. Synchronization mechanisms vary widely, but they may include locking, mutexes, and semaphores. When a multi-step operation on a shared resource cannot be guaranteed to execute independent of interference, then the resulting behavior can be unpredictable. Improper synchronization could lead to data or memory corruption, denial of service, etc.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-1782: Chain: improper locking (CWE-667) leads to race condition (CWE-362), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2009-0935: Attacker provides invalid address to a memory-reading function, causing a mutex to be unlocked twice\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-25668: A flaw was found in Linux Kernel because access to the global variable fg_console is not properly synchronized leading to a use after free in con_font_op.\n\n- CVE-2021-25376: An improper synchronization logic in Samsung Email prior to version 6.1.41.0 can leak messages in certain mailbox in plain text when STARTTLS negotiation is failed.\n\n- CVE-2021-36305: Dell PowerScale OneFS contains an Unsynchronized Access to Shared Data in a Multithreaded Context in SMB CA handling. An authenticated user of SMB on a cluster with CA could potentially exploit this vulnerability, leading to a denial of service over SMB.\n\n- CVE-2022-2962: A DMA reentrancy issue was found in the Tulip device emulation in QEMU. When Tulip reads or writes to the rx/tx descriptor or copies the rx/tx frame, it doesn't check whether the destination address is its own MMIO address. This can cause the device to trigger MMIO handlers multiple times, possibly leading to a stack or heap overflow. A malicious guest could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service condition.\n\n- CVE-2022-32609: In vcu, there is a possible use after free due to a race condition.

In affected versions of Redis an integer overflow bug in 32-bit Redis version 4.0 or newer could be exploited to corrupt the heap and potentially result with remote code execution. Redis 4.0 or newer uses a configurable limit for the maximum supported bulk input size. By default, it is 512MB which is a safe value for all platforms. If the limit is significantly increased, receiving a large request from a client may trigger several integer overflow scenarios, which would result with buffer overflow and heap corruption. We believe this could in certain conditions be exploited for remote code execution. By default, authenticated Redis users have access to all configuration parameters and can therefore use the \u201cCONFIG SET proto-max-bulk-len\u201d to change the safe default, making the system vulnerable. **This problem only affects 32-bit Redis (on a 32-bit system, or as a 32-bit executable running on a 64-bit system).** The problem is fixed in version 6.2, and the fix is back ported to 6.0.11 and 5.0.11. Make sure you use one of these versions if you are running 32-bit Redis. An additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the redis-server executable is to prevent clients from directly executing `CONFIG SET`: Using Redis 6.0 or newer, ACL configuration can be used to block the command. Using older versions, the `rename-command` configuration directive can be used to rename the command to a random string unknown to users, rendering it inaccessible. Please note that this workaround may have an additional impact on users or operational systems that expect `CONFIG SET` to behave in certain ways.\n\n- CVE-2021-21807: An integer overflow vulnerability exists in the DICOM parse_dicom_meta_info functionality of Accusoft ImageGear 19.9.

An integer overflow bug in Redis version 6.0 or newer, could be exploited using the STRALGO LCS command to corrupt the heap and potentially result with remote code execution. This is a result of an incomplete fix by CVE-2021-29477. The problem is fixed in version 6.2.4 and 6.0.14. An additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the redis-server executable is to use ACL configuration to prevent clients from using the STRALGO LCS command. On 64 bit systems which have the fixes of CVE-2021-29477 (6.2.3 or 6.0.13), it is sufficient to make sure that the proto-max-bulk-len config parameter is smaller than 2GB (default is 512MB).\n\n- CVE-2021-32628: Redis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk.

The problem is fixed in Redis versions 6.2.6, 6.0.16, 5.0.14. An additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the redis-server executable is to prevent users from modifying the above configuration parameters. This can be done using ACL to restrict unprivileged users from using the CONFIG SET command.\n\n- CVE-2021-34385: Trusty TLK contains a vulnerability in the NVIDIA TLK kernel where an integer overflow in the calculation of a length could lead to a heap overflow.\n\n- CVE-2021-34386: Trusty TLK contains a vulnerability in the NVIDIA TLK kernel where an integer overflow in the calloc size calculation can cause the multiplication of count and size can overflow, which might lead to heap overflows.\n\n- CVE-2021-39254: A crafted NTFS image can cause an integer overflow in memmove, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow in the function ntfs_attr_record_resize, in NTFS-3G < 2021.8.22.\n\n- CVE-2021-40346: An integer overflow exists in HAProxy 2.0 through 2.5 in htx_add_header that can be exploited to perform an HTTP request smuggling attack, allowing an attacker to bypass all configured http-request HAProxy ACLs and possibly other ACLs.\n\n- CVE-2021-41864: prealloc_elems_and_freelist in kernel/bpf/stackmap.c in the Linux kernel before 5.14.12 allows unprivileged users to trigger an eBPF multiplication integer overflow with a resultant out-of-bounds write.\n\n- CVE-2021-41991: The in-memory certificate cache in strongSwan before 5.9.4 has a remote integer overflow upon receiving many requests with different certificates to fill the cache and later trigger the replacement of cache entries.

Remote code execution might be a slight possibility.\n\n- CVE-2021-43784: runc is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers on Linux according to the OCI specification. In runc, netlink is used internally as a serialization system for specifying the relevant container configuration to the `C` portion of the code (responsible for the based namespace setup of containers). In all versions of runc prior to 1.0.3, the encoder did not handle the possibility of an integer overflow in the 16-bit length field for the byte array attribute type, meaning that a large enough malicious byte array attribute could result in the length overflowing and the attribute contents being parsed as netlink messages for container configuration. This vulnerability requires the attacker to have some control over the configuration of the container and would allow the attacker to bypass the namespace restrictions of the container by simply adding their own netlink payload which disables all namespaces. The main users impacted are those who allow untrusted images with untrusted configurations to run on their machines (such as with shared cloud infrastructure). runc version 1.0.3 contains a fix for this bug. As a workaround, one may try disallowing untrusted namespace paths from your container. It should be noted that untrusted namespace paths would allow the attacker to disable namespace protections entirely even in the absence of this bug.\n\n- CVE-2021-36155: LengthPrefixedMessageReader in gRPC Swift 1.1.0 and earlier allocates buffers of arbitrary length, which allows remote attackers to cause uncontrolled resource consumption and deny service.\n\n- CVE-2020-28009: Exim 4 before 4.94.2 allows Integer Overflow to Buffer Overflow because get_stdinput allows unbounded reads that are accompanied by unbounded increases in a certain size variable.

Integer overflow in matroskademux element in gst_matroska_decompress_data function which causes a segfault, or could cause a heap overwrite, depending on libc and OS. Depending on the libc used, and the underlying OS capabilities, it could be just a segfault or a heap overwrite. If the libc uses mmap for large chunks, and the OS supports mmap, then it is just a segfault (because the realloc before the integer overflow will use mremap to reduce the size of the chunk, and it will start to write to unmapped memory). However, if using a libc implementation that does not use mmap, or if the OS does not support mmap while using libc, then this could result in a heap overwrite.\n\n- CVE-2022-1923: DOS / potential heap overwrite in mkv demuxing using bzip decompression. Integer overflow in matroskademux element in bzip decompression function which causes a segfault, or could cause a heap overwrite, depending on libc and OS. Depending on the libc used, and the underlying OS capabilities, it could be just a segfault or a heap overwrite. If the libc uses mmap for large chunks, and the OS supports mmap, then it is just a segfault (because the realloc before the integer overflow will use mremap to reduce the size of the chunk, and it will start to write to unmapped memory).

Prior to versions 0.29.0.gfm.3 and 0.28.3.gfm.21, an integer overflow in cmark-gfm's table row parsing `table.c:row_from_string` may lead to heap memory corruption when parsing tables who's marker rows contain more than UINT16_MAX columns. The impact of this heap corruption ranges from Information Leak to Arbitrary Code Execution depending on how and where `cmark-gfm` is used. If `cmark-gfm` is used for rendering remote user controlled markdown, this vulnerability may lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) in applications employing affected versions of the `cmark-gfm` library. This vulnerability has been patched in the following cmark-gfm versions 0.29.0.gfm.3 and 0.28.3.gfm.21. A workaround is available. The vulnerability exists in the table markdown extensions of cmark-gfm. Disabling the table extension will prevent this vulnerability from being triggered.\n\n- CVE-2022-24795: yajl-ruby is a C binding to the YAJL JSON parsing and generation library. The 1.x branch and the 2.x branch of `yajl` contain an integer overflow which leads to subsequent heap memory corruption when dealing with large (~2GB) inputs. The reallocation logic at `yajl_buf.c#L64` may result in the `need` 32bit integer wrapping to 0 when `need` approaches a value of 0x80000000 (i.e. ~2GB of data), which results in a reallocation of buf->alloc into a small heap chunk. These integers are declared as `size_t` in the 2.x branch of `yajl`, which practically prevents the issue from triggering on 64bit platforms, however this does not preclude this issue triggering on 32bit builds on which `size_t` is a 32bit integer. Subsequent population of this under-allocated heap chunk is based on the original buffer size, leading to heap memory corruption. This vulnerability mostly impacts process availability. Maintainers believe exploitation for arbitrary code execution is unlikely. A patch is available and anticipated to be part of yajl-ruby version 1.4.2. As a workaround, avoid passing large inputs to YAJL.\n\n- CVE-2022-25291: An integer overflow in WatchGuard Firebox and XTM appliances allows an authenticated remote attacker to trigger a heap-based buffer overflow and potentially execute arbitrary code by initiating a firmware update with a malicious upgrade image.

If an attacker can force the function to fail or otherwise return a value that is not expected, then the subsequent program logic could lead to a vulnerability, because the product is not in a state that the programmer assumes. For example, if the program calls a function to drop privileges but does not check the return code to ensure that privileges were successfully dropped, then the program will continue to operate with the higher privileges.\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-17533: Chain: unchecked return value (CWE-252) of some functions for policy enforcement leads to authorization bypass (CWE-862)\n\n- CVE-2020-6078: Chain: The return value of a function returning a pointer is not checked for success (CWE-252) resulting in the later use of an uninitialized variable (CWE-456) and a null pointer dereference (CWE-476)\n\n- CVE-2019-15900: Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).\n\n- CVE-2007-3798: Unchecked return value leads to resultant integer overflow and code execution.\n\n- CVE-2006-4447: Program does not check return value when invoking functions to drop privileges, which could leave users with higher privileges than expected by forcing those functions to fail.\n\n- CVE-2006-2916: Program does not check return value when invoking functions to drop privileges, which could leave users with higher privileges than expected by forcing those functions to fail.\n\n- CVE-2008-5183: chain: unchecked return value can lead to NULL dereference\n\n- CVE-2010-0211: chain: unchecked return value (CWE-252) leads to free of invalid, uninitialized pointer (CWE-824).\n\n- CVE-2017-6964: Linux-based device mapper encryption program does not check the return value of setuid and setgid allowing attackers to execute code with unintended privileges.\n\n- CVE-2002-1372: Chain: Return values of file/socket operations are not checked (CWE-252), allowing resultant consumption of file descriptors (CWE-772).\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-28875: In the standard library in Rust before 1.50.0, read_to_end() does not validate the return value from Read in an unsafe context. This bug could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n- CVE-2021-21217: Uninitialized data in PDFium in Google Chrome prior to 90.0.4430.72 allowed a remote attacker to obtain potentially sensitive information from process memory via a crafted PDF file.\n\n- CVE-2021-21219: Uninitialized data in PDFium in Google Chrome prior to 90.0.4430.72 allowed a remote attacker to obtain potentially sensitive information from process memory via a crafted PDF file.\n\n- CVE-2021-3673: A vulnerability was found in Radare2 in version 5.3.1.

This could lead to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-195573629References: N/A\n\n- CVE-2021-0155: Unchecked return value in the BIOS firmware for some Intel(R) Processors may allow a privileged user to potentially enable information disclosure via local access.\n\n- CVE-2021-32845: HyperKit is a toolkit for embedding hypervisor capabilities in an application. In versions 0.20210107 and prior of HyperKit, the implementation of `qnotify` at `pci_vtrnd_notify` fails to check the return value of `vq_getchain`. This leads to `struct iovec iov;` being uninitialized and used to read memory in `len = (int) read(sc->vrsc_fd, iov.iov_base, iov.iov_len);` when an attacker is able to make `vq_getchain` fail. This issue may lead to a guest crashing the host causing a denial of service and, under certain circumstance, memory corruption. This issue is fixed in commit 41272a980197917df8e58ff90642d14dec8fe948.\n\n- CVE-2021-40401: A use-after-free vulnerability exists in the RS-274X aperture definition tokenization functionality of Gerbv 2.7.0 and dev (commit b5f1eacd) and Gerbv forked 2.7.1.

    "enhanced_query": "## Vulnerability Description\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved greybus Fix **use-after-free** bug in gb_interface_release due to **race condition**. In gb_interface_create, &intf->mode_switch_completion is bound with gb_interface_mode_switch_work. Then it will be started by gb_interface_request_mode_switch. Here is the relevant code. if (!queue_work(system_long_wq, &intf->mode_switch_work)) { ... } If we call gb_interface_release to make cleanup, there may be an unfinished work. This function will call kfree to free the object intf. However, if gb_interface_mode_switch_work is scheduled to run after kfree, it may cause **use-after-free** error as gb_interface_mode_switch_work will use the object intf. The possible execution flow that may lead to the issue is as follows CPU0 CPU1 | gb_interface_create | gb_interface_request_mode_switch gb_interface_release | kfree(intf) (free) | | gb_interface_mode_switch_work | mutex_lock(&intf->mutex) (use) Fix it by canceling the work before kfree.\n\n### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **rootcause:** **race condition**\n- **weakness:** **use-after-free**\n- **product:** Linux kernel\n- **component:** greybus\n\n## CVE Reference Links Content Summary\nBased on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n\n- A race condition exists in the `gb_interface_release` function of the Linux kernel's Greybus driver.\n- The `gb_interface_release` function frees the `intf` object using `kfree(intf)`.\n- Simultaneously, a worker thread, `gb_interface_mode_switch_work`, might still be scheduled to run after `intf` is freed.\n- This worker thread attempts to access members of the freed `intf` object (specifically, `intf->mutex`), leading to a use-after-free (UAF) vulnerability.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n\n- **Use-After-Free (UAF):** The primary vulnerability is a UAF that occurs when the `gb_interface_mode_switch_work` attempts to access the `intf` object after it has been freed.\n- **Race Condition:** The UAF is triggered by a race condition between the `gb_interface_release` function and the scheduling of the `gb_interface_mode_switch_work` work item.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n- **Kernel Crash:** The most likely impact is a kernel crash due to the invalid memory access from the UAF, leading to denial of service.\n- **Potential for Privilege Escalation:** While not explicitly mentioned, UAF vulnerabilities can sometimes be leveraged for more severe exploits, like arbitrary code execution with kernel privileges.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n- An attacker needs to trigger the following sequence of events:\n    1. Call `gb_interface_create` to create a Greybus interface.\n    2. Call `gb_interface_request_mode_switch` to schedule the `gb_interface_mode_switch_work`.\n    3. Call `gb_interface_release` to initiate the cleanup, leading to the `intf` object being freed.\n    4. Ensure `gb_interface_mode_switch_work` is scheduled to run after `kfree(intf)`.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n- The attacker needs to have the ability to interact with the Greybus driver to call the described functions. This may require a user with certain privileges or a specific device that uses the Greybus framework.\n- They need to be able to cause the described race condition by controlling the execution of the two different processes (process calling release and the worker thread).\n\n**Mitigation:**\n\nThe provided patch addresses the issue by adding the line `cancel_work_sync(&intf->mode_switch_work);` before `kfree(intf);` in the `gb_interface_release` function. This cancels the potentially pending work item before the object is freed, preventing the UAF.\n\nIn summary, this is a use-after-free vulnerability caused by a race condition in the Greybus driver that can lead to a kernel crash. The fix ensures that the work item is cancelled before the object is freed.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 362 | Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') | Class | Allowed-with-Review | alternate_terms | 1.000 |\n| 2 | 416 | Use After Free | Variant | Allowed | alternate_terms | 1.000 |\n| 3 | 415 | Double Free | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.634 |\n| 4 | 667 | Improper Locking | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.633 |\n| 5 | 367 | Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.587 |\n| 6 | 366 | Race Condition within a Thread | Base | Allowed | dense | 0.480 |\n| 7 | 123 | Write-what-where Condition | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.003 |\n| 8 | 401 | Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.570 |\n| 9 | 364 | Signal Handler Race Condition | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.570 |\n| 10 | 911 | Improper Update of Reference Count | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.561 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nA race condition occurs within concurrent environments, and it is effectively a property of a code sequence. Depending on the context, a code sequence may be in the form of a function call, a small number of instructions, a series of program invocations, etc.\n\n\nA race condition violates these properties, which are closely related:\n\n\n  - Exclusivity - the code sequence is given exclusive access to the shared resource, i.e., no other code sequence can modify properties of the shared resource before the original sequence has completed execution.\n\n  - Atomicity - the code sequence is behaviorally atomic, i.e., no other thread or process can concurrently execute the same sequence of instructions (or a subset) against the same resource.\n\nA race condition exists when an \"interfering code sequence\" can still access the shared resource, violating exclusivity.\n\nThe interfering code sequence could be \"trusted\" or \"untrusted.\" A trusted interfering code sequence occurs within the product; it cannot be modified by the attacker, and it can only be invoked indirectly. An untrusted interfering code sequence can be authored directly by the attacker, and typically it is external to the vulnerable product.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nRace Condition\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-691\nCanPrecede -> CWE-416\nCanPrecede -> CWE-476\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** The relationship between race conditions and synchronization problems (CWE-662) needs to be further developed. They are not necessarily two perspectives of the same core concept, since synchronization is only one technique for avoiding race conditions, and synchronization can be used for other purposes besides race condition prevention.\n\n**[Research Gap]** Race conditions in web applications are under-studied and probably under-reported. However, in 2008 there has been growing interest in this area.\n\n**[Research Gap]** Much of the focus of race condition research has been in Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) variants (CWE-367), but many race conditions are related to synchronization problems that do not necessarily require a time-of-check.\n\n**[Research Gap]** From a classification/taxonomy perspective, the relationships between concurrency and program state need closer investigation and may be useful in organizing related issues.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-29527:** Go application for cloud management creates a world-writable sudoers file that allows local attackers to inject sudo rules and escalate privileges to root by winning a race condition.\n- **CVE-2021-1782:** Chain: improper locking (CWE-667) leads to race condition (CWE-362), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2021-0920:** Chain: mobile platform race condition (CWE-362) leading to use-after-free (CWE-416), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-416: Use After Free\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product reuses or references memory after it has been freed. At some point afterward, the memory may be allocated again and saved in another pointer, while the original pointer references a location somewhere within the new allocation. Any operations using the original pointer are no longer valid because the memory \"belongs\" to the code that operates on the new pointer.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nDangling pointer: a pointer that no longer points to valid memory, often after it has been freed\nUAF: commonly used acronym for Use After Free\nUse-After-Free\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-825\nChildOf -> CWE-672\nChildOf -> CWE-672\nChildOf -> CWE-672\nCanPrecede -> CWE-120\nCanPrecede -> CWE-123\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

This corruption can cause the program to crash or, in some circumstances, cause two later calls to malloc() to return the same pointer. If malloc() returns the same value twice and the program later gives the attacker control over the data that is written into this doubly-allocated memory, the program becomes vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nDouble-free\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-825\nChildOf -> CWE-1341\nChildOf -> CWE-672\nChildOf -> CWE-672\nChildOf -> CWE-672\nChildOf -> CWE-666\nPeerOf -> CWE-416\nPeerOf -> CWE-123\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

It could also be primary to weaknesses such as buffer overflows.\n\n**[Theoretical]** It could be argued that Double Free would be most appropriately located as a child of \"Use after Free\", but \"Use\" and \"Release\" are considered to be distinct operations within vulnerability theory, therefore this is more accurately \"Release of a Resource after Expiration or Release\", which doesn't exist yet.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2006-5051:** Chain: Signal handler contains too much functionality (CWE-828), introducing a race condition (CWE-362) that leads to a double free (CWE-415).\n- **CVE-2004-0642:** Double free resultant from certain error conditions.\n- **CVE-2004-0772:** Double free resultant from certain error conditions.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nLocking is a type of synchronization behavior that ensures that multiple independently-operating processes or threads do not interfere with each other when accessing the same resource. All processes/threads are expected to follow the same steps for locking. If these steps are not followed precisely - or if no locking is done at all - then another process/thread could modify the shared resource in a way that is not visible or predictable to the original process. This can lead to data or memory corruption, denial of service, etc.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-662\nChildOf -> CWE-662\nChildOf -> CWE-662\nChildOf -> CWE-662\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** Deeper research is necessary for synchronization and related mechanisms, including locks, mutexes, semaphores, and other mechanisms. Multiple entries are dependent on this research, which includes relationships to concurrency, race conditions, reentrant functions, etc. CWE-662 and its children - including CWE-667, CWE-820, CWE-821, and others - may need to be modified significantly, along with their relationships.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-1782:** Chain: improper locking (CWE-667) leads to race condition (CWE-362), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2009-0935:** Attacker provides invalid address to a memory-reading function, causing a mutex to be unlocked twice\n- **CVE-2010-4210:** function in OS kernel unlocks a mutex that was not previously locked, causing a panic or overwrite of arbitrary memory.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check. This can cause the product to perform invalid actions when the resource is in an unexpected state.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis weakness can be security-relevant when an attacker can influence the state of the resource between check and use. This can happen with shared resources such as files, memory, or even variables in multithreaded programs.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nTOCTTOU: The TOCTTOU acronym expands to \"Time Of Check To Time Of Use\".\nTOCCTOU: The TOCCTOU acronym is most likely a typo of TOCTTOU, but it has been used in some influential documents, so the typo is repeated fairly frequently.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-362\nChildOf -> CWE-362\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

If there are no more pointers or references to the memory, then it can no longer be tracked and identified for release.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nMemory Leak\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-772\nChildOf -> CWE-404\nChildOf -> CWE-404\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

These race conditions have a variety of root causes and symptoms. Attackers may be able to exploit a signal handler race condition to cause the product state to be corrupted, possibly leading to a denial of service or even code execution.\n\n\nThese issues occur when non-reentrant functions, or state-sensitive actions occur in the signal handler, where they may be called at any time. These behaviors can violate assumptions being made by the \"regular\" code that is interrupted, or by other signal handlers that may also be invoked. If these functions are called at an inopportune moment - such as while a non-reentrant function is already running - memory corruption could occur that may be exploitable for code execution. Another signal race condition commonly found occurs when free is called within a signal handler, resulting in a double free and therefore a write-what-where condition. Even if a given pointer is set to NULL after it has been freed, a race condition still exists between the time the memory was freed and the pointer was set to NULL. This is especially problematic if the same signal handler has been set for more than one signal -- since it means that the signal handler itself may be reentered.\n\n\nThere are several known behaviors related to signal handlers that have received the label of \"signal handler race condition\":\n\n\n  - Shared state (e.g. global data or static variables) that are accessible to both a signal handler and \"regular\" code\n\n  - Shared state between a signal handler and other signal handlers\n\n  - Use of non-reentrant functionality within a signal handler - which generally implies that shared state is being used. For example, malloc() and free() are non-reentrant because they may use global or static data structures for managing memory, and they are indirectly used by innocent-seeming functions such as syslog(); these functions could be exploited for memory corruption and, possibly, code execution.\n\n  - Association of the same signal handler function with multiple signals - which might imply shared state, since the same code and resources are accessed. For example, this can be a source of double-free and use-after-free weaknesses.\n\n  - Use of setjmp and longjmp, or other mechanisms that prevent a signal handler from returning control back to the original functionality\n\n  - While not technically a race condition, some signal handlers are designed to be called at most once, and being called more than once can introduce security problems, even when there are not any concurrent calls to the signal handler. This can be a source of double-free and use-after-free weaknesses.\n\nSignal handler vulnerabilities are often classified based on the absence of a specific protection mechanism, although this style of classification is discouraged in CWE because programmers often have a choice of several different mechanisms for addressing the weakness. Such protection mechanisms may preserve exclusivity of access to the shared resource, and behavioral atomicity for the relevant code:\n\n  - Avoiding shared state\n\n  - Using synchronization in the signal handler\n\n  - Using synchronization in the regular code\n\n  - Disabling or masking other signals, which provides atomicity (which effectively ensures exclusivity)\n\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-362\nCanPrecede -> CWE-415\nCanPrecede -> CWE-416\nCanPrecede -> CWE-123\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

When the reference count reaches zero, the resource can be de-allocated or reused because there are no more objects that use it. If the reference count accidentally reaches zero, then the resource might be released too soon, even though it is still in use. If all objects no longer use the resource, but the reference count is not zero, then the resource might not ever be released.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-664\nCanPrecede -> CWE-672\nCanPrecede -> CWE-772\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

In affected versions the implementation for `tf.raw_ops.BoostedTreesCreateEnsemble` can result in a use after free error if an attacker supplies specially crafted arguments. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/f24faa153ad31a4b51578f8181d3aaab77a1ddeb/tensorflow/core/kernels/boosted_trees/resource_ops.cc#L55) uses a reference counted resource and decrements the refcount if the initialization fails, as it should. However, when the code was written, the resource was represented as a naked pointer but later refactoring has changed it to be a smart pointer. Thus, when the pointer leaves the scope, a subsequent `free`-ing of the resource occurs, but this fails to take into account that the refcount has already reached 0, thus the resource has been already freed. During this double-free process, members of the resource object are accessed for cleanup but they are invalid as the entire resource has been freed. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 5ecec9c6fbdbc6be03295685190a45e7eee726ab. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2020-14123: There is a pointer double free vulnerability in Some MIUI Services.

All processes/threads are expected to follow the same steps for locking.

The fix for CVE-2019-16770 was incomplete. The original fix only protected existing connections that had already been accepted from having their requests starved by greedy persistent-connections saturating all threads in the same process. However, new connections may still be starved by greedy persistent-connections saturating all threads in all processes in the cluster. A `puma` server which received more concurrent `keep-alive` connections than the server had threads in its threadpool would service only a subset of connections, denying service to the unserved connections. This problem has been fixed in `puma` 4.3.8 and 5.3.1. Setting `queue_requests false` also fixes the issue. This is not advised when using `puma` without a reverse proxy, such as `nginx` or `apache`, because you will open yourself to slow client attacks (e.g. slowloris). The fix is very small and a git patch is available for those using unsupported versions of Puma.\n\n- CVE-2021-4001: A race condition was found in the Linux kernel's ebpf verifier between bpf_map_update_elem and bpf_map_freeze due to a missing lock in kernel/bpf/syscall.c.

The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.\n\n- CVE-2022-0280: A race condition vulnerability exists in the QuickClean feature of McAfee Total Protection for Windows prior to 16.0.43 that allows a local user to gain privilege elevation and perform an arbitrary file delete. This could lead to sensitive files being deleted and potentially cause denial of service. This attack exploits the way symlinks are created and how the product works with them.\n\n- CVE-2022-0915: There is a Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition Vulnerability in Logitech Sync for Windows prior to 2.4.574. Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may escalate the permission to the system user.\n\n- CVE-2022-21198: Time-of-check time-of-use race condition in the BIOS firmware for some Intel(R) Processors may allow a privileged user to potentially enable escalation of privilege via local access.\n\n- CVE-2022-23651: b2-sdk-python is a python library to access cloud storage provided by backblaze. Linux and Mac releases of the SDK version 1.14.0 and below contain a key disclosure vulnerability that, in certain conditions, can be exploited by local attackers through a time-of-check-time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition. SDK users of the SqliteAccountInfo format are vulnerable while users of the InMemoryAccountInfo format are safe. The SqliteAccountInfo saves API keys (and bucket name-to-id mapping) in a local database file ($XDG_CONFIG_HOME/b2/account_info, ~/.b2_account_info or a user-defined path). When first created, the file is world readable and is (typically a few milliseconds) later altered to be private to the user. If the directory containing the file is readable by a local attacker then during the brief period between file creation and permission modification, a local attacker can race to open the file and maintain a handle to it. This allows the local attacker to read the contents after the file after the sensitive information has been saved to it. Consumers of this SDK who rely on it to save data using SqliteAccountInfo class should upgrade to the latest version of the SDK. Those who believe a local user might have opened a handle using this race condition, should remove the affected database files and regenerate all application keys. Users should upgrade to b2-sdk-python 1.14.1 or later.\n\n- CVE-2022-23653: B2 Command Line Tool is the official command line tool for the backblaze cloud storage service. Linux and Mac releases of the B2 command-line tool version 3.2.0 and below contain a key disclosure vulnerability that, in certain conditions, can be exploited by local attackers through a time-of-check-time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition. The command line tool saves API keys (and bucket name-to-id mapping) in a local database file (`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/b2/account_info`, `~/.b2_account_info` or a user-defined path) when `b2 authorize-account` is first run. This happens regardless of whether a valid key is provided or not. When first created, the file is world readable and is (typically a few milliseconds) later altered to be private to the user. If the directory is readable by a local attacker and the user did not yet run `b2 authorize-account` then during the brief period between file creation and permission modification, a local attacker can race to open the file and maintain a handle to it. This allows the local attacker to read the contents after the file after the sensitive information has been saved to it. Users that have not yet run `b2 authorize-account` should upgrade to B2 Command-Line Tool v3.2.1 before running it. Users that have run `b2 authorize-account` are safe if at the time of the file creation no other local users had read access to the local configuration file. Users that have run `b2 authorize-account` where the designated path could be opened by another local user should upgrade to B2 Command-Line Tool v3.2.1 and remove the database and regenerate all application keys. Note that `b2 clear-account` does not remove the database file and it should not be used to ensure that all open handles to the file are invalidated. If B2 Command-Line Tool cannot be upgraded to v3.2.1 due to a dependency conflict, a binary release can be used instead. Alternatively a new version could be installed within a virtualenv, or the permissions can be changed to prevent local users from opening the database file.\n\n- CVE-2022-25165: An issue was discovered in Amazon AWS VPN Client 2.0.0. A TOCTOU race condition exists during the validation of VPN configuration files. This allows parameters outside of the AWS VPN Client allow list to be injected into the configuration file prior to the AWS VPN Client service (running as SYSTEM) processing the file. Dangerous arguments can be injected by a low-level user such as log, which allows an arbitrary destination to be specified for writing log files. This leads to an arbitrary file write as SYSTEM with partial control over the files content. This can be abused to cause an elevation of privilege or denial of service.\n\n- CVE-2022-26859: Dell BIOS contains a race condition vulnerability. A local attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious input via SMI in order to bypass security checks during SMM.\n\n- CVE-2022-28743: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition vulerability in Foscam R2C IP camera running System FW <= 1.13.1.6, and Application FW <= 2.91.2.66, allows an authenticated remote attacker with administrator permissions to execute arbitrary remote code via a malicious firmware patch. The impact of this vulnerability is that the remote attacker could gain full remote access to the IP camera and the underlying Linux system with root permissions. With root access to the camera's Linux OS, an attacker could effectively change the code that is running, add backdoor access, or invade the privacy of the user by accessing the live camera stream.\n\n- CVE-2022-29800: A time-of-check-time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition vulnerability was found in networkd-dispatcher. This flaw exists because there is a certain time between the scripts being discovered and them being run. An attacker can abuse this vulnerability to replace scripts that networkd-dispatcher believes to be owned by root with ones that are not.\n\n- CVE-2022-31466: Time of Check - Time of Use (TOCTOU) vulnerability in Quick Heal Total Security prior to 12.1.1.27 allows a local attacker to achieve privilege escalation, potentially leading to deletion of system files. This is achieved through exploiting the time between detecting a file as malicious and when the action of quarantining or cleaning is performed, and using the time to replace the malicious file by a symlink.\n\n- CVE-2022-33691: A possible race condition vulnerability in score driver prior to SMR Jul-2022 Release 1 can allow local attackers to interleave malicious operations.\n\n- CVE-2022-34830: An Arm product family through 2022-06-29 has a TOCTOU Race Condition that allows non-privileged user to make improper GPU processing operations to gain access to already freed memory.\n\n- CVE-2022-34899: This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of Parallels Access 6.5.4 (39316) Agent. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target host system in order to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the Parallels service. By creating a symbolic link, an attacker can abuse the service to execute a file. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-16134.\n\n- CVE-2022-3590: WordPress is affected by an unauthenticated blind SSRF in the pingback feature. Because of a TOCTOU race condition between the validation checks and the HTTP request, attackers can reach internal hosts that are explicitly forbidden.\n\n- CVE-2022-45842: Unauth. Race Condition vulnerability in WP ULike Plugin <= 4.6.4 on WordPress allows attackers to increase/decrease rating scores. \n\n- CVE-2022-1537: file.copy operations in GruntJS are vulnerable to a TOCTOU race condition leading to arbitrary file write in GitHub repository gruntjs/grunt prior to 1.5.3. This vulnerability is capable of arbitrary file writes which can lead to local privilege escalation to the GruntJS user if a lower-privileged user has write access to both source and destination directories as the lower-privileged user can create a symlink to the GruntJS user's .bashrc file or replace /etc/shadow file if the GruntJS user is root.\n\n- CVE-2022-21658: Rust is a multi-paradigm, general-purpose programming language designed for performance and safety, especially safe concurrency. The Rust Security Response WG was notified that the `std::fs::remove_dir_all` standard library function is vulnerable a race condition enabling symlink following (CWE-363). An attacker could use this security issue to trick a privileged program into deleting files and directories the attacker couldn't otherwise access or delete. Rust 1.0.0 through Rust 1.58.0 is affected by this vulnerability with 1.58.1 containing a patch. Note that the following build targets don't have usable APIs to properly mitigate the attack, and are thus still vulnerable even with a patched toolchain: macOS before version 10.10 (Yosemite) and REDOX. We recommend everyone to update to Rust 1.58.1 as soon as possible, especially people developing programs expected to run in privileged contexts (including system daemons and setuid binaries), as those have the highest risk of being affected by this. Note that adding checks in your codebase before calling remove_dir_all will not mitigate the vulnerability, as they would also be vulnerable to race conditions like remove_dir_all itself. The existing mitigation is working as intended outside of race conditions.\n\n- CVE-2022-23563: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. In multiple places, TensorFlow uses `tempfile.mktemp` to create temporary files. While this is acceptable in testing, in utilities and libraries it is dangerous as a different process can create the file between the check for the filename in `mktemp` and the actual creation of the file by a subsequent operation (a TOC/TOU type of weakness). In several instances, TensorFlow was supposed to actually create a temporary directory instead of a file. This logic bug is hidden away by the `mktemp` function usage. We have patched the issue in several commits, replacing `mktemp` with the safer `mkstemp`/`mkdtemp` functions, according to the usage pattern. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible.\n\n- CVE-2021-4098: Insufficient data validation in Mojo in Google Chrome prior to 96.0.4664.110 allowed a remote attacker who had compromised the renderer process to potentially perform a sandbox escape via a crafted HTML page.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-362 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-362 (ChildOf)",

This vulnerability is due to improper resource management when connection rates are high. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by opening a significant number of connections on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.\n\n- CVE-2020-15254: Crossbeam is a set of tools for concurrent programming. In crossbeam-channel before version 0.4.4, the bounded channel incorrectly assumes that `Vec::from_iter` has allocated capacity that same as the number of iterator elements. `Vec::from_iter` does not actually guarantee that and may allocate extra memory. The destructor of the `bounded` channel reconstructs `Vec` from the raw pointer based on the incorrect assumes described above. This is unsound and causing deallocation with the incorrect capacity when `Vec::from_iter` has allocated different sizes with the number of iterator elements. This has been fixed in crossbeam-channel 0.4.4.\n\n- CVE-2020-27827: A flaw was found in multiple versions of OpenvSwitch. Specially crafted LLDP packets can cause memory to be lost when allocating data to handle specific optional TLVs, potentially causing a denial of service.

FreeSWITCH prior to version 1.10.7 is susceptible to Denial of Service via SIP flooding. When flooding FreeSWITCH with SIP messages, it was observed that after a number of seconds the process was killed by the operating system due to memory exhaustion. By abusing this vulnerability, an attacker is able to crash any FreeSWITCH instance by flooding it with SIP messages, leading to Denial of Service. The attack does not require authentication and can be carried out over UDP, TCP or TLS. This issue was patched in version 1.10.7.\n\n- CVE-2021-31261: The gf_hinter_track_new function in GPAC 1.0.1 allows attackers to read memory via a crafted file in the MP4Box command.\n\n- CVE-2020-22844: A buffer overflow in Mikrotik RouterOS 6.47 allows unauthenticated attackers to cause a denial of service (DOS) via crafted SMB requests.\n\n- CVE-2021-40008: There is a memory leak vulnerability in CloudEngine 12800 V200R019C00SPC800, CloudEngine 5800 V200R019C00SPC800, CloudEngine 6800 V200R019C00SPC800 and CloudEngine 7800 V200R019C00SPC800. The software does not sufficiently track and release allocated memory while parse a series of crafted binary messages, which could consume remaining memory. Successful exploit could cause memory exhaust.\n\n- CVE-2022-20046: In Bluetooth, there is a possible memory corruption due to a logic error. This could lead to local denial of service with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation. Patch ID: ALPS06142410; Issue ID: ALPS06142410.\n\n- CVE-2021-33437: An issue was discovered in mjs (mJS: Restricted JavaScript engine), ES6 (JavaScript version 6). There are memory leaks in frozen_cb() in mjs.c.\n\n- CVE-2021-42197: An issue was discovered in swftools through 20201222 through a memory leak in the swftools when swfdump is used. It allows an attacker to cause code execution.\n\n- CVE-2022-0854: A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel\u2019s DMA subsystem, in the way a user calls DMA_FROM_DEVICE. This flaw allows a local user to read random memory from the kernel space.\n\n- CVE-2022-22155: An Uncontrolled Resource Consumption vulnerability in the handling of IPv6 neighbor state change events in Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an adjacent attacker to cause a memory leak in the Flexible PIC Concentrator (FPC) of an ACX5448 router. The continuous flapping of an IPv6 neighbor with specific timing will cause the FPC to run out of resources, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition. Once the condition occurs, further packet processing will be impacted, creating a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition, requiring a manual PFE restart to restore service.

It is possible to gradually erode available memory to the point where named crashes for lack of resources.\n\n- CVE-2022-23471: containerd is an open source container runtime. A bug was found in containerd's CRI implementation where a user can exhaust memory on the host. In the CRI stream server, a goroutine is launched to handle terminal resize events if a TTY is requested. If the user's process fails to launch due to, for example, a faulty command, the goroutine will be stuck waiting to send without a receiver, resulting in a memory leak. Kubernetes and crictl can both be configured to use containerd's CRI implementation and the stream server is used for handling container IO. This bug has been fixed in containerd 1.6.12 and 1.5.16. Users should update to these versions to resolve the issue. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that only trusted images and commands are used and that only trusted users have permissions to execute commands in running containers. \n\n- CVE-2021-42522: There is a Information Disclosure vulnerability in anjuta/plugins/document-manager/anjuta-bookmarks.c.

        "matched_text": "CWE-364: Signal Handler Race Condition\n\nType: Base\n\nStatus: Incomplete\n\nDescription:\n\nThe product uses a signal handler that introduces a race condition.\n\nExtended Details:\n\n\n\nRace conditions frequently occur in signal handlers, since signal handlers support asynchronous actions. These race conditions have a variety of root causes and symptoms. Attackers may be able to exploit a signal handler race condition to cause the product state to be corrupted, possibly leading to a denial of service or even code execution.\n\n\nThese issues occur when non-reentrant functions, or state-sensitive actions occur in the signal handler, where they may be called at any time. These behaviors can violate assumptions being made by the \"regular\" code that is interrupted, or by other signal handlers that may also be invoked. If these functions are called at an inopportune moment - such as while a non-reentrant function is already running - memory corruption could occur that may be exploitable for code execution. Another signal race condition commonly found occurs when free is called within a signal handler, resulting in a double free and therefore a write-what-where condition. Even if a given pointer is set to NULL after it has been freed, a race condition still exists between the time the memory was freed and the pointer was set to NULL. This is especially problematic if the same signal handler has been set for more than one signal -- since it means that the signal handler itself may be reentered.\n\n\nThere are several known behaviors related to signal handlers that have received the label of \"signal handler race condition\":\n\n\n  - Shared state (e.g. global data or static variables) that are accessible to both a signal handler and \"regular\" code\n\n  - Shared state between a signal handler and other signal handlers\n\n  - Use of non-reentrant functionality within a signal handler - which generally implies that shared state is being used. For example, malloc() and free() are non-reentrant because they may use global or static data structures for managing memory, and they are indirectly used by innocent-seeming functions such as syslog(); these functions could be exploited for memory corruption and, possibly, code execution.\n\n  - Association of the same signal handler function with multiple signals - which might imply shared state, since the same code and resources are accessed. For example, this can be a source of double-free and use-after-free weaknesses.\n\n  - Use of setjmp and longjmp, or other mechanisms that prevent a signal handler from returning control back to the original functionality\n\n  - While not technically a race condition, some signal handlers are designed to be called at most once, and being called more than once can introduce security problems, even when there are not any concurrent calls to the signal handler. This can be a source of double-free and use-after-free weaknesses.\n\nSignal handler vulnerabilities are often classified based on the absence of a specific protection mechanism, although this style of classification is discouraged in CWE because programmers often have a choice of several different mechanisms for addressing the weakness. Such protection mechanisms may preserve exclusivity of access to the shared resource, and behavioral atomicity for the relevant code:\n\n  - Avoiding shared state\n\n  - Using synchronization in the signal handler\n\n  - Using synchronization in the regular code\n\n  - Disabling or masking other signals, which provides atomicity (which effectively ensures exclusivity)\n\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-1999-0035: Signal handler does not disable other signal handlers, allowing it to be interrupted, causing other functionality to access files/etc. with raised privileges\n\n- CVE-2001-0905: Attacker can send a signal while another signal handler is already running, leading to crash or execution with root privileges\n\n- CVE-2001-1349: unsafe calls to library functions from signal handler\n\n- CVE-2004-0794: SIGURG can be used to remotely interrupt signal handler; other variants exist\n\n- CVE-2004-2259: SIGCHLD signal to FTP server can cause crash under heavy load while executing non-reentrant functions like malloc/free.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-0244: A signal handler race condition exists in the Layer 2 Address Learning Daemon (L2ALD) of Juniper Networks Junos OS due to the absence of a specific protection mechanism to avoid a race condition which may allow an attacker to bypass the storm-control feature on devices.

Some shared resource operations cannot be executed atomically; that is, multiple steps must be guaranteed to execute sequentially, without any interference by other processes. Synchronization mechanisms vary widely, but they may include locking, mutexes, and semaphores.

In affected versions of Redis an integer overflow bug in 32-bit Redis version 4.0 or newer could be exploited to corrupt the heap and potentially result with remote code execution. Redis 4.0 or newer uses a configurable limit for the maximum supported bulk input size. By default, it is 512MB which is a safe value for all platforms. If the limit is significantly increased, receiving a large request from a client may trigger several integer overflow scenarios, which would result with buffer overflow and heap corruption. We believe this could in certain conditions be exploited for remote code execution. By default, authenticated Redis users have access to all configuration parameters and can therefore use the \u201cCONFIG SET proto-max-bulk-len\u201d to change the safe default, making the system vulnerable. **This problem only affects 32-bit Redis (on a 32-bit system, or as a 32-bit executable running on a 64-bit system).** The problem is fixed in version 6.2, and the fix is back ported to 6.0.11 and 5.0.11. Make sure you use one of these versions if you are running 32-bit Redis. An additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the redis-server executable is to prevent clients from directly executing `CONFIG SET`: Using Redis 6.0 or newer, ACL configuration can be used to block the command. Using older versions, the `rename-command` configuration directive can be used to rename the command to a random string unknown to users, rendering it inaccessible. Please note that this workaround may have an additional impact on users or operational systems that expect `CONFIG SET` to behave in certain ways.\n\n- CVE-2021-21807: An integer overflow vulnerability exists in the DICOM parse_dicom_meta_info functionality of Accusoft ImageGear 19.9.

An integer overflow bug in Redis version 6.0 or newer, could be exploited using the STRALGO LCS command to corrupt the heap and potentially result with remote code execution. This is a result of an incomplete fix by CVE-2021-29477. The problem is fixed in version 6.2.4 and 6.0.14. An additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the redis-server executable is to use ACL configuration to prevent clients from using the STRALGO LCS command. On 64 bit systems which have the fixes of CVE-2021-29477 (6.2.3 or 6.0.13), it is sufficient to make sure that the proto-max-bulk-len config parameter is smaller than 2GB (default is 512MB).\n\n- CVE-2021-32628: Redis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk. An integer overflow bug in the ziplist data structure used by all versions of Redis can be exploited to corrupt the heap and potentially result with remote code execution. The vulnerability involves modifying the default ziplist configuration parameters (hash-max-ziplist-entries, hash-max-ziplist-value, zset-max-ziplist-entries or zset-max-ziplist-value) to a very large value, and then constructing specially crafted commands to create very large ziplists. The problem is fixed in Redis versions 6.2.6, 6.0.16, 5.0.14. An additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the redis-server executable is to prevent users from modifying the above configuration parameters. This can be done using ACL to restrict unprivileged users from using the CONFIG SET command.\n\n- CVE-2021-34385: Trusty TLK contains a vulnerability in the NVIDIA TLK kernel where an integer overflow in the calculation of a length could lead to a heap overflow.\n\n- CVE-2021-34386: Trusty TLK contains a vulnerability in the NVIDIA TLK kernel where an integer overflow in the calloc size calculation can cause the multiplication of count and size can overflow, which might lead to heap overflows.\n\n- CVE-2021-39254: A crafted NTFS image can cause an integer overflow in memmove, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow in the function ntfs_attr_record_resize, in NTFS-3G < 2021.8.22.\n\n- CVE-2021-40346: An integer overflow exists in HAProxy 2.0 through 2.5 in htx_add_header that can be exploited to perform an HTTP request smuggling attack, allowing an attacker to bypass all configured http-request HAProxy ACLs and possibly other ACLs.\n\n- CVE-2021-41864: prealloc_elems_and_freelist in kernel/bpf/stackmap.c in the Linux kernel before 5.14.12 allows unprivileged users to trigger an eBPF multiplication integer overflow with a resultant out-of-bounds write.\n\n- CVE-2021-41991: The in-memory certificate cache in strongSwan before 5.9.4 has a remote integer overflow upon receiving many requests with different certificates to fill the cache and later trigger the replacement of cache entries.

Remote code execution might be a slight possibility.\n\n- CVE-2021-43784: runc is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers on Linux according to the OCI specification. In runc, netlink is used internally as a serialization system for specifying the relevant container configuration to the `C` portion of the code (responsible for the based namespace setup of containers). In all versions of runc prior to 1.0.3, the encoder did not handle the possibility of an integer overflow in the 16-bit length field for the byte array attribute type, meaning that a large enough malicious byte array attribute could result in the length overflowing and the attribute contents being parsed as netlink messages for container configuration. This vulnerability requires the attacker to have some control over the configuration of the container and would allow the attacker to bypass the namespace restrictions of the container by simply adding their own netlink payload which disables all namespaces. The main users impacted are those who allow untrusted images with untrusted configurations to run on their machines (such as with shared cloud infrastructure). runc version 1.0.3 contains a fix for this bug. As a workaround, one may try disallowing untrusted namespace paths from your container. It should be noted that untrusted namespace paths would allow the attacker to disable namespace protections entirely even in the absence of this bug.\n\n- CVE-2021-36155: LengthPrefixedMessageReader in gRPC Swift 1.1.0 and earlier allocates buffers of arbitrary length, which allows remote attackers to cause uncontrolled resource consumption and deny service.\n\n- CVE-2020-28009: Exim 4 before 4.94.2 allows Integer Overflow to Buffer Overflow because get_stdinput allows unbounded reads that are accompanied by unbounded increases in a certain size variable.

Depending on the libc used, and the underlying OS capabilities, it could be just a segfault or a heap overwrite. If the libc uses mmap for large chunks, and the OS supports mmap, then it is just a segfault (because the realloc before the integer overflow will use mremap to reduce the size of the chunk, and it will start to write to unmapped memory). However, if using a libc implementation that does not use mmap, or if the OS does not support mmap while using libc, then this could result in a heap overwrite.\n\n- CVE-2022-1923: DOS / potential heap overwrite in mkv demuxing using bzip decompression. Integer overflow in matroskademux element in bzip decompression function which causes a segfault, or could cause a heap overwrite, depending on libc and OS. Depending on the libc used, and the underlying OS capabilities, it could be just a segfault or a heap overwrite. If the libc uses mmap for large chunks, and the OS supports mmap, then it is just a segfault (because the realloc before the integer overflow will use mremap to reduce the size of the chunk, and it will start to write to unmapped memory). However, if using a libc implementation that does not use mmap, or if the OS does not support mmap while using libc, then this could result in a heap overwrite.\n\n- CVE-2022-1924: DOS / potential heap overwrite in mkv demuxing using lzo decompression. Integer overflow in matroskademux element in lzo decompression function which causes a segfault, or could cause a heap overwrite, depending on libc and OS. Depending on the libc used, and the underlying OS capabilities, it could be just a segfault or a heap overwrite.

Users are advised to upgrade to a patched version.\n\n- CVE-2022-24310: A CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound vulnerability exists that could cause heap-based buffer overflow, leading to denial of service and potentially remote code execution when an attacker sends multiple specially crafted messages. Affected Product: Interactive Graphical SCADA System Data Server (V15.0.0.22020 and prior)\n\n- CVE-2022-24724: cmark-gfm is GitHub's extended version of the C reference implementation of CommonMark. Prior to versions 0.29.0.gfm.3 and 0.28.3.gfm.21, an integer overflow in cmark-gfm's table row parsing `table.c:row_from_string` may lead to heap memory corruption when parsing tables who's marker rows contain more than UINT16_MAX columns. The impact of this heap corruption ranges from Information Leak to Arbitrary Code Execution depending on how and where `cmark-gfm` is used. If `cmark-gfm` is used for rendering remote user controlled markdown, this vulnerability may lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) in applications employing affected versions of the `cmark-gfm` library. This vulnerability has been patched in the following cmark-gfm versions 0.29.0.gfm.3 and 0.28.3.gfm.21. A workaround is available. The vulnerability exists in the table markdown extensions of cmark-gfm. Disabling the table extension will prevent this vulnerability from being triggered.\n\n- CVE-2022-24795: yajl-ruby is a C binding to the YAJL JSON parsing and generation library. The 1.x branch and the 2.x branch of `yajl` contain an integer overflow which leads to subsequent heap memory corruption when dealing with large (~2GB) inputs. The reallocation logic at `yajl_buf.c#L64` may result in the `need` 32bit integer wrapping to 0 when `need` approaches a value of 0x80000000 (i.e. ~2GB of data), which results in a reallocation of buf->alloc into a small heap chunk. These integers are declared as `size_t` in the 2.x branch of `yajl`, which practically prevents the issue from triggering on 64bit platforms, however this does not preclude this issue triggering on 32bit builds on which `size_t` is a 32bit integer. Subsequent population of this under-allocated heap chunk is based on the original buffer size, leading to heap memory corruption. This vulnerability mostly impacts process availability. Maintainers believe exploitation for arbitrary code execution is unlikely. A patch is available and anticipated to be part of yajl-ruby version 1.4.2. As a workaround, avoid passing large inputs to YAJL.\n\n- CVE-2022-25291: An integer overflow in WatchGuard Firebox and XTM appliances allows an authenticated remote attacker to trigger a heap-based buffer overflow and potentially execute arbitrary code by initiating a firmware update with a malicious upgrade image.

Versions 7.0.0 and above, prior to 7.0.5 are vulnerable to an Integer Overflow. Executing an `XAUTOCLAIM` command on a stream key in a specific state, with a specially crafted `COUNT` argument may cause an integer overflow, a subsequent heap overflow, and potentially lead to remote code execution. This has been patched in Redis version 7.0.5. No known workarounds exist.\n\n- CVE-2022-39343: Azure RTOS FileX is a FAT-compatible file system that\u2019s fully integrated with Azure RTOS ThreadX. In versions before 6.2.0, the Fault Tolerant feature of Azure RTOS FileX includes integer under and overflows which may be exploited to achieve buffer overflow and modify memory contents. When a valid log file with correct ID and checksum is detected by the `_fx_fault_tolerant_enable` function an attempt to recover the previous failed write operation is taken by call of `_fx_fault_tolerant_apply_logs`. This function iterates through the log entries and performs required recovery operations. When properly crafted a log including entries of type `FX_FAULT_TOLERANT_DIR_LOG_TYPE` may be utilized to introduce unexpected behavior. This issue has been patched in version 6.2.0. A workaround to fix line 218 in fx_fault_tolerant_apply_logs.c is documented in the GHSA.\n\n- CVE-2022-41318: A buffer over-read was discovered in libntlmauth in Squid 2.5 through 5.6.

If an attacker can force the function to fail or otherwise return a value that is not expected, then the subsequent program logic could lead to a vulnerability, because the product is not in a state that the programmer assumes. For example, if the program calls a function to drop privileges but does not check the return code to ensure that privileges were successfully dropped, then the program will continue to operate with the higher privileges.\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-17533: Chain: unchecked return value (CWE-252) of some functions for policy enforcement leads to authorization bypass (CWE-862)\n\n- CVE-2020-6078: Chain: The return value of a function returning a pointer is not checked for success (CWE-252) resulting in the later use of an uninitialized variable (CWE-456) and a null pointer dereference (CWE-476)\n\n- CVE-2019-15900: Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).\n\n- CVE-2007-3798: Unchecked return value leads to resultant integer overflow and code execution.\n\n- CVE-2006-4447: Program does not check return value when invoking functions to drop privileges, which could leave users with higher privileges than expected by forcing those functions to fail.\n\n- CVE-2006-2916: Program does not check return value when invoking functions to drop privileges, which could leave users with higher privileges than expected by forcing those functions to fail.\n\n- CVE-2008-5183: chain: unchecked return value can lead to NULL dereference\n\n- CVE-2010-0211: chain: unchecked return value (CWE-252) leads to free of invalid, uninitialized pointer (CWE-824).\n\n- CVE-2017-6964: Linux-based device mapper encryption program does not check the return value of setuid and setgid allowing attackers to execute code with unintended privileges.\n\n- CVE-2002-1372: Chain: Return values of file/socket operations are not checked (CWE-252), allowing resultant consumption of file descriptors (CWE-772).\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-28875: In the standard library in Rust before 1.50.0, read_to_end() does not validate the return value from Read in an unsafe context. This bug could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n- CVE-2021-21217: Uninitialized data in PDFium in Google Chrome prior to 90.0.4430.72 allowed a remote attacker to obtain potentially sensitive information from process memory via a crafted PDF file.\n\n- CVE-2021-21219: Uninitialized data in PDFium in Google Chrome prior to 90.0.4430.72 allowed a remote attacker to obtain potentially sensitive information from process memory via a crafted PDF file.\n\n- CVE-2021-3673: A vulnerability was found in Radare2 in version 5.3.1. Improper input validation when reading a crafted LE binary can lead to resource exhaustion and DoS.\n\n- CVE-2021-39643: In ic_startRetrieveEntryValue of acropora/app/identity/ic.c, there is a possible bypass of defense-in-depth due to missing validation of the return value. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-195573629References: N/A\n\n- CVE-2021-0155: Unchecked return value in the BIOS firmware for some Intel(R) Processors may allow a privileged user to potentially enable information disclosure via local access.\n\n- CVE-2021-32845: HyperKit is a toolkit for embedding hypervisor capabilities in an application. In versions 0.20210107 and prior of HyperKit, the implementation of `qnotify` at `pci_vtrnd_notify` fails to check the return value of `vq_getchain`. This leads to `struct iovec iov;` being uninitialized and used to read memory in `len = (int) read(sc->vrsc_fd, iov.iov_base, iov.iov_len);` when an attacker is able to make `vq_getchain` fail. This issue may lead to a guest crashing the host causing a denial of service and, under certain circumstance, memory corruption. This issue is fixed in commit 41272a980197917df8e58ff90642d14dec8fe948.\n\n- CVE-2021-40401: A use-after-free vulnerability exists in the RS-274X aperture definition tokenization functionality of Gerbv 2.7.0 and dev (commit b5f1eacd) and Gerbv forked 2.7.1. A specially-crafted gerber file can lead to code execution. An attacker can provide a malicious file to trigger this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2022-25718: Cryptographic issue in WLAN due to improper check on return value while authentication handshake in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer Electronics Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon IoT, Snapdragon Mobile, Snapdragon Voice & Music, Snapdragon Wearables, Snapdragon Wired Infrastructure and Networking\n\n- CVE-2021-34405: NVIDIA Linux distributions contain a vulnerability in TrustZone\u2019s TEE_Malloc function, where an unchecked return value causing a null pointer dereference may lead to denial of service.\n\n- CVE-2022-0907: Unchecked Return Value to NULL Pointer Dereference in tiffcrop in libtiff 4.3.0 allows attackers to cause a denial-of-service via a crafted tiff file. For users that compile libtiff from sources, the fix is available with commit f2b656e2.\n\n- CVE-2022-22231: An Unchecked Return Value to NULL Pointer Dereference vulnerability in Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS). On SRX Series if Unified Threat Management (UTM) Enhanced Content Filtering (CF) and AntiVirus (AV) are enabled together and the system processes specific valid transit traffic the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) will crash and restart. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS 21.4 versions prior to 21.4R1-S2, 21.4R2 on SRX Series. This issue does not affect Juniper Networks Junos OS versions prior to 21.4R1.\n\n- CVE-2022-22233: An Unchecked Return Value to NULL Pointer Dereference vulnerability in Routing Protocol Daemon (rpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows a locally authenticated attacker with low privileges to cause a Denial of Service (DoS). In Segment Routing (SR) to Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) interworking scenario, configured with Segment Routing Mapping Server (SRMS) at any node, when an Area Border Router (ABR) leaks the SRMS entries having \"S\" flag set from IS-IS Level 2 to Level 1, an rpd core might be observed when a specific low privileged CLI command is issued.

          "extended_description": "\n\nRace conditions frequently occur in signal handlers, since signal handlers support asynchronous actions. These race conditions have a variety of root causes and symptoms. Attackers may be able to exploit a signal handler race condition to cause the product state to be corrupted, possibly leading to a denial of service or even code execution.\n\n\nThese issues occur when non-reentrant functions, or state-sensitive actions occur in the signal handler, where they may be called at any time. These behaviors can violate assumptions being made by the \"regular\" code that is interrupted, or by other signal handlers that may also be invoked. If these functions are called at an inopportune moment - such as while a non-reentrant function is already running - memory corruption could occur that may be exploitable for code execution. Another signal race condition commonly found occurs when free is called within a signal handler, resulting in a double free and therefore a write-what-where condition. Even if a given pointer is set to NULL after it has been freed, a race condition still exists between the time the memory was freed and the pointer was set to NULL. This is especially problematic if the same signal handler has been set for more than one signal -- since it means that the signal handler itself may be reentered.\n\n\nThere are several known behaviors related to signal handlers that have received the label of \"signal handler race condition\":\n\n\n  - Shared state (e.g. global data or static variables) that are accessible to both a signal handler and \"regular\" code\n\n  - Shared state between a signal handler and other signal handlers\n\n  - Use of non-reentrant functionality within a signal handler - which generally implies that shared state is being used. For example, malloc() and free() are non-reentrant because they may use global or static data structures for managing memory, and they are indirectly used by innocent-seeming functions such as syslog(); these functions could be exploited for memory corruption and, possibly, code execution.\n\n  - Association of the same signal handler function with multiple signals - which might imply shared state, since the same code and resources are accessed. For example, this can be a source of double-free and use-after-free weaknesses.\n\n  - Use of setjmp and longjmp, or other mechanisms that prevent a signal handler from returning control back to the original functionality\n\n  - While not technically a race condition, some signal handlers are designed to be called at most once, and being called more than once can introduce security problems, even when there are not any concurrent calls to the signal handler. This can be a source of double-free and use-after-free weaknesses.\n\nSignal handler vulnerabilities are often classified based on the absence of a specific protection mechanism, although this style of classification is discouraged in CWE because programmers often have a choice of several different mechanisms for addressing the weakness. Such protection mechanisms may preserve exclusivity of access to the shared resource, and behavioral atomicity for the relevant code:\n\n  - Avoiding shared state\n\n  - Using synchronization in the signal handler\n\n  - Using synchronization in the regular code\n\n  - Disabling or masking other signals, which provides atomicity (which effectively ensures exclusivity)\n\n",
