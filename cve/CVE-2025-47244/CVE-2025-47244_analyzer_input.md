# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-47244

## Vulnerability Description
Inedo ProGet through 2024.22 allows remote attackers to reach restricted functionality through the C# reflection layer, as demonstrated by causing a denial of service (when an attacker executes a loop calling RestartWeb) or obtaining potentially sensitive information. Exploitation can occur if Anonymous access is enabled, or if there is a successful CSRF attack.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **vector:** C# reflection layer
- **product:** Inedo ProGet
- **impact:** denial of service, obtain sensitive information
- **attacker:** remote attackers
- **version:** through 2024.22

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Here's the analysis of the provided content:

**Relevant Content:**

The content from `seclists.org_5e1f7a6e_20250624_143206.html` describes a denial-of-service (DoS) and information disclosure vulnerability in Inedo ProGet versions 2024.22 and below, based on information from a Full Disclosure mailing list post.

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The information system directly exposes the C# reflection used during the request-action mapping process and fails to properly protect certain pathways.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   Unauthenticated denial of service (DoS).
    *   Information disclosure.
    *   Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) due to the application's failure to verify the HTTP request method.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated attacker can chain CSRF and reflection attacks to cancel executions, restart the ProGet instance, and perform other actions.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attack leverages the exposed reflection mechanism and lack of CSRF protection.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An unauthenticated attacker can exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Mitigation or fix:** The content does not provide a fix.

**More detail than official CVE description:** The provided content details specific attack vectors and a sample script to demonstrate the vulnerability. It highlights the impact and attack steps more explicitly.
