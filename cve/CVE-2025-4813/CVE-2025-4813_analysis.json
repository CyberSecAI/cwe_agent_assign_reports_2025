  "description": "A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, was found in PHPGurukul Human Metapneumovirus Testing Management System 1.0. Affected is an unknown function of the file /edit-phlebotomist.php. The manipulation of the argument mobilenumber leads to **sql injection**. It is possible to launch the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.",
