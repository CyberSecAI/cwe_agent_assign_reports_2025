  "description": "A vulnerability has been found in the CPython `venv` module and CLI where path names provided when creating a virtual environment were not quoted properly, allowing the creator to inject commands into virtual environment activation scripts (ie source venv/bin/activate). This means that attacker-controlled virtual environments are able to run commands when the virtual environment is activated. Virtual environments which are not created by an attacker or which arent activated before being used (ie ./venv/bin/python) are not affected.",

CWE-78 is a Base level CWE and a child of CWE-77 (Class). Both CWEs relate to **improper neutralization of special elements** in commands. However, since the vulnerability specifically involves commands executed by the operating system, CWE-78 is a more specific fit and thus, it is considered a secondary candidate.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe1336[\"CWE-1336: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine\"]\n    \n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n    cwe1336 -->|PEEROF| cwe77\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe77 primary\n    class cwe78,cwe1336 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper escaping of user input**, leading to a **command injection** vulnerability. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands. The chain can be represented as follows:\n\n1.  **Improper Escaping (Root Cause):** The `venv` module does not properly quote path names, leading to **improper escaping of user input**.\n2.  **Command Injection (Weakness):** Due to the **improper escaping**, an attacker can inject commands into virtual environment activation scripts.\n3.  **Arbitrary Command Execution (Impact):** When the virtual environment is activated, the injected commands are executed, leading to arbitrary command execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis indicates that the primary weakness is CWE-77, **Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')**, because the core issue is the injection of commands due to **improper neutralization**. This is supported by the vulnerability description, which states that path names are not quoted properly, allowing command injection. The CVE reference summary reinforces this by mentioning \"Command injection vulnerability due to **improper quoting** of paths in activation scripts.\"\n\nCWE-78, **Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')**, is considered as a secondary candidate because the injected commands are executed by the operating system.\n\nCWE-1336, **Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine**, is also considered as a secondary candidate because the root cause indicates `template strings in venv activation scripts were not properly quoted`.\n\nThe selection of CWE-77 as the primary weakness is based on the evidence that the vulnerability enables command injection through **improper neutralization** of input. The other two CWEs are related, but not the primary issue. The abstraction levels are appropriate, with CWE-77 being a Class and CWE-78 and CWE-1336 being Base, providing sufficient specificity.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-88: Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs a string for a command to be executed by a separate component\nin another control sphere, but it does not properly delimit the\nintended arguments, options, or switches within that command string.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-95: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes code syntax before using the input in a dynamic evaluation call (e.g. \"eval\").\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
