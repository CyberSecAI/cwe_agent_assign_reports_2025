  "description": "An **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption** vulnerability in the aftmand process of Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to consume memory resources, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS) condition. The processes do not recover on their own and must be manually restarted. This issue affects both IPv4 and IPv6. Changes in memory usage can be monitored using the following CLI command user@device> show system memory node | grep evo-aftmann This issue affects Junos OS Evolved * All versions before 21.2R3-S8-EVO, * 21.3 versions before 21.3R3-S5-EVO, * 21.4 versions before 21.4R3-S5-EVO, * 22.1 versions before 22.1R3-S4-EVO, * 22.2 versions before 22.2R3-S4-EVO, * 22.3 versions before 22.3R3-S3-EVO, * 22.4 versions before 22.4R2-S2-EVO, 22.4R3-EVO, * 23.2 versions before 23.2R1-S1-EVO, 23.2R2-EVO.",

While other CWEs were considered, **CWE-400** most accurately captures the essence of the vulnerability as described, where an unauthenticated attacker can consume memory resources leading to a denial-of-service condition. **CWE-770** is a more specific type of **CWE-400** where resources are allocated without limits or throttling, so it could be a secondary candidate, but the provided information does not give enough information to confirm.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe400 primary\n    class cwe770 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption** (CWE-400). The attacker exploits this by sending network requests that cause the system to consume excessive memory. This leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition as the system becomes unresponsive due to resource exhaustion.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly points to **CWE-400**: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption as the primary weakness. The vulnerability description explicitly states \"**Uncontrolled Resource Consumption** vulnerability\" and further details how an attacker can consume memory resources, leading to a denial-of-service condition. This aligns perfectly with the definition of **CWE-400**.\n\nOther CWEs were considered, particularly those related to resource management and input validation, but none matched the core issue as directly as **CWE-400**. For instance, while **CWE-770**: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling is a child of **CWE-400** and could be relevant, the description doesn't explicitly state that the resources are allocated without limits, only that they are consumed in an uncontrolled manner.\n\nThe decision to classify this vulnerability as **CWE-400** is based on the direct statement in the vulnerability description and the subsequent explanation of how resource consumption leads to a denial-of-service. This classification is at the Class level of abstraction, which is appropriate given the information provided.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource, thereby enabling an actor to influence the amount of resources consumed, eventually leading to the exhaustion of available resources.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-400 is intended for incorrect behaviors in which the product is expected to track and restrict how many resources it consumes, but CWE-400 is often misused because it is conflated with the \"technical impact\" of vulnerabilities in which resource consumption occurs.
