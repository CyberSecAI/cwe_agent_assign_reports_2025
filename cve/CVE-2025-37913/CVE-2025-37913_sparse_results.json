  "query": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved net_sched qfq Fix double list add in class with netem as child qdisc As described in Gerrards report [1], there are use cases where a netem child qdisc will make the parent qdiscs enqueue callback reentrant. In the case of qfq, there wont be a UAF, but the code will add the same classifier to the list twice, which will cause memory corruption. This patch checks whether the class was already added to the agg->active list (cl_is_active) before doing the addition to cater for the reentrant case.
