  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved net_sched qfq Fix **double list add** in class with netem as child qdisc As described in Gerrards report [1], there are use cases where a netem child qdisc will make the parent qdiscs enqueue callback reentrant. In the case of qfq, there wont be a UAF, but the code will add the same classifier to the list twice, which will cause **memory corruption**. This patch checks whether the class was already added to the agg->active list (cl_is_active) before doing the addition to cater for the reentrant case.

The **double list add** leads to memory corruption via an out-of-bounds write.|\n| CWE-415 | Double Free | 0.3 | Variant | Allowed | Secondary candidate. The vulnerability description mentions **memory corruption**, but it explicitly states that there is no UAF (Use-After-Free). Double-Free can lead to memory corruption.|\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship influencing the CWE selection is the parent-child relationship. While **memory corruption** is a high-level impact, the root cause is the **double list add** which leads to an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787). Double Free (CWE-415) was considered because it can cause memory corruption, but the description states it is not a UAF.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe415[\"CWE-415: Double Free\"]\n\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe415 -->|CHILDOF| cwe666[\"CWE-666: Operation on Resource in Wrong Phase of Lifetime\"]\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe415 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a reentrant enqueue callback in qfq, leading to a **double list add**, which then results in **memory corruption** due to an out-of-bounds write.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) as the primary candidate due to the **memory corruption** caused by the **double list add**. The description clearly points to a scenario where data is written beyond the intended boundaries.\n\nThe evidence supporting CWE-787 is extracted from the vulnerability description: \"the code will add the same classifier to the list twice, which will cause **memory corruption**.\" The corrective patch also supports this by checking if the class was already added. This directly implies that the vulnerability stems from writing data outside the allocated buffer.\n\nCWE-415 (Double Free) was considered but is less likely as it does not align as closely with the provided description. While it can also cause memory corruption, the report mentions specifically that there will not be a UAF.\n\nThe selection of CWE-787 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly describes the root cause (out-of-bounds write) of the observed **memory corruption**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
