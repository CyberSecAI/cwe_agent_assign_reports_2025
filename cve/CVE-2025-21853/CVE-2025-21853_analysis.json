  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved bpf avoid holding freeze_mutex during mmap operation We use map->freeze_mutex to prevent **races between map_freeze() and memory mapping BPF map contents** with writable permissions. The way we naively do this means well hold freeze_mutex for entire duration of all the mm and VMA manipulations, which is completely unnecessary. This can potentially also lead to deadlocks, as reported by syzbot in [0]. So, instead, hold freeze_mutex only during writeability checks, bump (proactively) write active count for the map, unlock the mutex and proceed with mmap logic. And only if something went wrong during mmap logic, then undo that write active counter increment. [0] https//lore.kernel.org/bpf/678dcbc9.050a0220.303755.0066.GAE@google.com/",

While CWE-362 is broader, CWE-367 specifically identifies the TOCTOU condition, which is directly indicated by the vulnerability description mentioning **races between map_freeze() and memory mapping BPF map contents**. Additionally, CWE-667 (Improper Locking) is related to CWE-367 as locking issues can often lead to race conditions. The abstraction levels were also considered, with a preference for the more specific Base level CWE-367 over the Class level CWE-667.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe367[\"CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\"]\n    cwe667[\"CWE-667: Improper Locking\"]\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n\n    cwe367 -->|CHILDOF| cwe362\n    cwe367 -->|PEEROF| cwe667\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe367 primary\n    class cwe667 secondary\n    class cwe362 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **races between map_freeze() and memory mapping BPF map contents** (CWE-367), which is caused by **improper locking** (CWE-667), potentially leading to deadlocks.\n  - Root Cause: CWE-367 Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\n  - Contributing factor: CWE-667 Improper Locking\n  - Impact: Deadlocks (not explicitly mapped to a CWE due to lack of specificity)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment strongly pointed towards CWE-367 due to the explicit mention of **races**. The retriever results also highlighted this CWE. The decision was further supported by the vulnerability description focusing on the timing window and the potential for a change in resource state between the check and the use. The relationship analysis confirmed that CWE-367 is a more specific type of race condition, making it a better fit than more general concurrency CWEs. CWE-667 was considered as a contributing factor since the **improper locking** mechanism allowed the race condition to occur, although this is more of a contributing factor than the primary weakness. This assessment is primarily based on the provided vulnerability description and the retriever results, both of which directly point to the presence of a race condition. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, providing a clear and accurate representation of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not check or incorrectly checks for unusual or exceptional conditions that are not expected to occur frequently during day to day operation of the product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check.
