  "query": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved udmabuf fix memory leak on last export_udmabuf() error path In export_udmabuf(), if dma_buf_fd() fails because the FD table is full, a dma_buf owning the udmabuf has already been created but the error handling in udmabuf_create() will tear down the udmabuf without doing anything about the containing dma_buf. This leaves a dma_buf in memory that contains a dangling pointer though that doesnt seem to lead to anything bad except a memory leak. Fix it by moving the dma_buf_fd() call out of export_udmabuf() so that we can give it different error handling. Note that the shape of this code changed a lot in commit 5e72b2b41a21 (udmabuf convert udmabuf driver to use folios) but the memory leak seems to have existed since the introduction of udmabuf.",
