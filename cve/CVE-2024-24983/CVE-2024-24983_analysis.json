While this might typically warrant exploring more specific child CWEs, in this case, the vulnerability description explicitly states \"**Protection mechanism failure**\" as the root cause. Without further details, it is difficult to identify a more granular CWE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe693[\"CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe693 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Protection mechanism failure** (CWE-693)\n2.  **Impact:** Denial of service\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based heavily on the provided evidence, specifically the \"**Protection mechanism failure**\" statement in the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary.
