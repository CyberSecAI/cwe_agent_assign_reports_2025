  "description": "Vulnerability in the JD Edwards EnterpriseOne Tools product of Oracle JD Edwards (component Web Runtime SEC). Supported versions that are affected are 9.2.0.0-9.2.9.2. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows low privileged attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise JD Edwards EnterpriseOne Tools. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in JD Edwards EnterpriseOne Tools, attacks may significantly impact additional products (scope change). Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of JD Edwards EnterpriseOne Tools accessible data as well as unauthorized read access to a subset of JD Edwards EnterpriseOne Tools accessible data.

While it is generally discouraged to map to Class-level CWEs, the description indicates a general authorization issue without specifying a more detailed root cause. CWE-306, \"Missing Authentication for Critical Function,\" is added as a secondary CWE because the description mentions the attacker is low privileged, and that could indicate there is a function missing authentication.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    \n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe285 -->|PEEROF| cwe287\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe285 primary\n    class cwe306 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **missing or improper authorization** check (CWE-285) or a **missing authentication** (CWE-306). This leads to unauthorized data access (update, insert, delete, read).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description indicates that a low-privileged attacker can compromise the JD Edwards EnterpriseOne Tools via HTTP, leading to unauthorized data access. The core issue seems to be related to how authorization is handled, which aligns with CWE-285 \"Improper Authorization\". The attacker being low privileged suggests that a function might be missing authentication, hence CWE-306.\n\nThe primary evidence from the vulnerability description is:\n\"Easily exploitable vulnerability allows low privileged attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise JD Edwards EnterpriseOne Tools.
