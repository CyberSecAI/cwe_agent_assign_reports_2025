# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-28143

# Vulnerability Description

    The password change function at /cgi/admin.cgi does not require the current/old password, which makes the application vulnerable to account takeover. An attacker can use this to forcefully set a new password within the -rsetpass+-aaction+- parameterfor a user without knowing the old password, e.g. by exploiting a **CSRF issue**.
