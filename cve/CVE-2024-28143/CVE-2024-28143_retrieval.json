An attacker can use this to forcefully set a new password within the -rsetpass+-aaction+- parameterfor a user without knowing the old password, e.g. by exploiting a **CSRF issue**.', key_phrases={'rootcause': '', 'weakness': ['CSRF issue', 'forcefully set new password'], 'impact': 'account takeover', 'vector': 'CSRF issue', 'attacker': 'attacker', 'product': '', 'version': '', 'component': '/cgi/admin.cgi'}, reference_content=\"Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-28143:\\n\\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\\n\\nThe password change functionality within the Image Access Scan2Net software does not require the user to provide their current password when setting a new one.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\\n\\n*   **Insecure Password Change Function:** Lack of current password validation before changing the password.\\n\\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\\n\\n*   **Account Takeover:** An attacker can change a user's password without knowing the existing one, leading to unauthorized access and control of the account.\\n*   If combined with CSRF (CVE-2024-28141), the impact is further amplified, allowing attackers to change passwords without direct interaction.\\n\\n**Attack Vectors:**\\n\\n*   **Direct Manipulation:** An attacker can directly access the password change functionality, typically via the web interface, and submit a request with only the new password.\\n*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** By crafting malicious links and tricking a logged-in user into visiting them, an attacker can force a password change without the user's knowledge or consent.\\n\\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\\n\\n*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs network connectivity to the Image Access device's web interface.\\n*   **For CSRF:** Attacker needs to lure a logged-in user to a malicious link or website\\n*   **No Authentication needed:** An attacker does not need to be logged into an account to perform this attack.\\n\\n**Additional Notes:**\\n*   The vulnerability was found to be present in firmware versions <=7.40, <=7.42, <7.42B.\\n*   The issue was fixed in firmware version 7.42B.\\n*  The advisory mentions that this issue is especially critical when combined with the CSRF vulnerability(CVE-2024-28141).\", similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '',
