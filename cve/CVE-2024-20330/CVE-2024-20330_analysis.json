  "description": "A vulnerability in the Snort 2 and Snort 3 TCP and UDP detection engine of Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software for Cisco Firepower 2100 Series Appliances could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause **memory corruption**, which could cause the Snort detection engine to restart unexpectedly. This vulnerability is due to **improper memory management** when the Snort detection engine processes specific TCP or UDP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted TCP or UDP packets through a device that is inspecting traffic using the Snort detection engine. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to restart the Snort detection engine repeatedly, which could cause a denial of service (DoS) condition. The DoS condition impacts only the traffic through the device that is examined by the Snort detection engine. The device can still be managed over the network. Note Once a memory block is corrupted, it cannot be cleared until the Cisco Firepower 2100 Series Appliance is manually reloaded. This means that the Snort detection engine could crash repeatedly, causing traffic that is processed by the Snort detection engine to be dropped until the device is manually reloaded.",

While the description mentions **memory corruption**, the root cause is **improper memory management**, which leads to a memory leak (CWE-401). CWE-787 could be a consequence of the memory corruption, but the description focuses more on the **missing release** aspect and not the write itself.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe401[\"CWE-401: Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe401 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe787\n    cwe787 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe401\n    cwe119 -->|RELATED| cwe401\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe401 primary\n    class cwe787 secondary\n    class cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper memory management** (CWE-401), which leads to **memory corruption**, and ultimately results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.\n- **Root Cause:** CWE-401 (Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime)\n- **Weakness:** Memory corruption\n- **Impact:** Denial of Service due to Snort engine restarts\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary focus of the vulnerability is on **improper memory management** that causes memory corruption, leading to a DoS. While several CWEs were considered, the evidence strongly supports CWE-401 as the root cause, specifically the missing release aspect. CWE-787 is a possible consequence, but the initial problem is the failure to properly manage memory.\n\nThe analysis is primarily based on the provided vulnerability description and CVE reference. The key phrase \"**improper memory management**\" is a strong indicator. Additionally, the description notes that the memory corruption persists until the device is reloaded, suggesting a leak rather than a simple buffer overflow. The retriever results support the consideration of CWE-401 and CWE-787. The relationship graph shows how these CWEs can be related but highlights CWE-401 as the likely starting point.\n\nCWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) was considered but not selected because the description explicitly points to memory management issues (leaking), rather than generalized resource consumption. CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) is too general, and more specific CWEs like CWE-787 or CWE-401 are more appropriate.\n\n**Relevant CWE Information:**\n\n## Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
