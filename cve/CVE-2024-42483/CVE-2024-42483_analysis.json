  "description": "ESP-NOW Component provides a connectionless Wi-Fi communication protocol. An replay attacks vulnerability was discovered in the implementation of the ESP-NOW because the **caches is not differentiated by message types**, it is a single, shared resource for all kinds of messages, whether they are broadcast or unicast, and regardless of whether they are ciphertext or plaintext. This can result an attacker to clear the cache of its legitimate entries, there by creating an opportunity to re-inject previously captured packets. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.5.2.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n\n- The `ESP-NOW` implementation uses a single, shared cache for all message types (broadcast, unicast, ciphertext, plaintext). This lack of differentiation allows an attacker to manipulate the cache.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n\n- **Replay Attack Vulnerability:** Due to the shared cache, an attacker can clear legitimate entries and re-inject previously captured packets. This is a classic replay attack scenario.\n- **Insufficient Cache Separation:** The core issue is the lack of separate caches for plaintext and ciphertext messages.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n- An attacker can replay previously captured packets, potentially leading to:\n    - Unauthorized actions\n    - Denial of service\n    - Other application-specific consequences\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n- The attack vector involves capturing legitimate `ESP-NOW` packets, manipulating the message cache by sending specially crafted packets to evict the legitimate entries, and then re-injecting the captured packets.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n- The attacker needs to be within radio range to intercept and transmit `ESP-NOW` packets.\n- The attacker needs to understand the structure of `ESP-NOW` messages and the caching mechanism.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n- **Patch:** The vulnerability is addressed by implementing separate caches for plaintext and ciphertext messages. This prevents attackers from clearing the ciphertext cache with plaintext messages and vice-versa.\n- **Mitigation:** While the patch mitigates the specific attack vector, it is not a complete solution. An attacker with more effort can still replay old ciphertext messages. However, given the connectionless nature of `ESP-NOW`, the fix is considered sufficient.\n- **Affected Versions:** Versions of `ESP-NOW` up to and including 2.5.1 are affected.\n- **Patched Version:** Version 2.5.2 contains the fix.\n- **CVE ID:** CVE-2024-42483\n- **CWE:** CWE-349 (Acceptance of Inconsistent Information)",

This leads to the ability for an attacker to clear legitimate cache entries and then replay captured packets.\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** Cache not differentiated by message types.\n2.  **Weakness:** Replay attack vulnerability due to shared cache.\n3.  **Impact:** Attacker replays packets, leading to unauthorized actions or denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-294 as the primary candidate based on the description of a replay attack. This was supported by the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section which explicitly mentioned the **replay attack vulnerability** due to the shared cache. The **root cause** is the \"caches is not differentiated by message types\". The Retriever Results listed many CWEs, but the evidence strongly supports CWE-294.\n\nThe selection of CWE-294 is at the Base level of abstraction, which is appropriate given the specific nature of the vulnerability. The shared cache allows attackers to replay captured packets.\nThe choice of CWE-349 is due to the caches accepting different message types.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-294: Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA capture-replay flaw exists when the design of the product makes it possible for a malicious user to sniff network traffic and bypass authentication by replaying it to the server in question to the same effect as the original message (or with minor changes).\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n### Technical Explanation for CWE-294\n\n*   **How the vulnerability's details match the CWE's characteristics:** The vulnerability description explicitly describes a scenario where an attacker can capture and replay packets due to the lack of cache separation for different message types. This directly aligns with the definition of CWE-294, which involves bypassing authentication (or other security mechanisms) by replaying captured network traffic.\n*   **The security implications and potential impact:** The primary security implication is the potential for unauthorized actions or denial of service, as an attacker can replay previously captured packets to impersonate a legitimate user or disrupt network services.\n*   **Any parent-child relationships or chain patterns that influenced your mapping:** N/A\n*   **Whether the weakness is primary or secondary in the vulnerability:** Primary.\n*   **How the official MITRE mapping guidance influenced your decision:** The MITRE mapping guidance allows for the use of CWE-294 and is at the Base level of abstraction, which is preferred.\n\n### Technical Explanation for CWE-349\n\n*   **How the vulnerability's details match the CWE's characteristics:** The vulnerability involves the acceptance of both plaintext and ciphertext messages in the same cache without proper differentiation. This aligns with CWE-349, where extraneous untrusted data (e.g., plaintext messages) is accepted along with trusted data (e.g., ciphertext messages), leading to a vulnerability.\n*   **The security implications and potential impact:** The security implication is that an attacker can manipulate the cache by injecting plaintext messages to clear legitimate ciphertext entries, facilitating a replay attack.\n*   **Any parent-child relationships or chain patterns that influenced your mapping:** N/A\n*   **Whether the weakness is primary or secondary in the vulnerability:** Secondary.\n*   **How the official MITRE mapping guidance influenced your decision:** The MITRE mapping guidance allows for the use of CWE-349 and is at the Base level of abstraction, which is preferred.\n\n### CWEs Considered But Not Used\n\n*   **CWE-203, CWE-204, CWE-208:** These CWEs relate to observable discrepancies, but the core issue is not simply an observable difference in behavior.\n*   **CWE-319:** While sensitive information is transmitted, the primary issue is not the cleartext transmission itself but the ability to replay packets due to the lack of cache separation.\n*   **CWE-327:** This CWE relates to broken cryptographic algorithms, which is not the core issue in this vulnerability.\n*   **CWE-770:** This CWE relates to resource allocation without limits, not the core issue.\n*   **CWE-113:** This CWE relates to HTTP request/response splitting, which is not relevant to this vulnerability.\n*   **CWE-941:** This CWE relates to incorrectly specified destinations in a communication channel, which is not the core issue.",
