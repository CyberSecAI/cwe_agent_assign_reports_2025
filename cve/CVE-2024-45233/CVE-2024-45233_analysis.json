  "description": "An issue was discovered in powermail extension through 12.3.5 for TYPO3. Several actions in the OutputController can directly be called, due to **missing or insufficiently implemented access checks**, resulting in Broken Access Control. Depending on the configuration of the Powermail Frontend plugins, an unauthenticated attacker can exploit this to edit, update, delete, or export data of persisted forms. This can only be exploited when the Powermail Frontend plugins are used. The fixed versions are 7.5.0, 8.5.0, 10.9.0, and 12.4.0.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Vulnerability:**\n\n*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The `powermail` extension fails to properly validate the `mail` parameter within the `confirmationAction`. This allows an unauthenticated attacker to access and view user-submitted data from **all forms** stored by the extension.\n*   **Broken Access Control:** Due to missing or insufficient access checks, several actions in the `OutputController` can be directly called. This allows an unauthenticated attacker to potentially edit, update, delete, or export data of stored forms.\n\n**Root Cause:**\n\n*   **IDOR:** Lack of proper validation of the `mail` parameter in the `confirmationAction`.\n*   **Broken Access Control:** Missing or insufficient access checks in the `OutputController`.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **IDOR:** An attacker can view sensitive user-submitted data from all forms.\n*   **Broken Access Control:** An attacker can edit, update, delete, or export stored form data. The impact depends on the configuration of the \"Powermail Frontend\" plugin.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **IDOR:** By manipulating the `mail` parameter in the `confirmationAction` requests.\n*   **Broken Access Control:** By directly calling actions in the `OutputController` of the extension.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   The attacker needs to be unauthenticated.\n*   The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable TYPO3 instance.\n*   For IDOR, the extension must be configured to save form data to the database which is the default.\n*   For Broken Access Control, \"Powermail Frontend\" plugins must be used.\n\n**Additional Notes**\n*   The vulnerability is present in `powermail` versions 7.4.3 and below, 8.0.0 - 8.4.2, 9.0.0 - 10.8.2, 12.0.0 - 12.3.5.\n*   The severity of the vulnerabilities is rated as **Medium**.\n*   The export and RSS functionality of the \"Powermail Frontend\" plugin have been removed in the updated version.\n*   The provided content also references CVE-2024-45232, which is another vulnerability within the same extension.",

This allows an unauthenticated attacker to directly call several actions, leading to broken access control and the ability to edit, update, delete, or export data of persisted forms.\n  - **Root Cause:** CWE-862 (**Missing Authorization**)\n  - **Impact:** Broken Access Control leading to data modification/export.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability based on the provided evidence. The vulnerability description key phrases explicitly mention \"**missing or insufficiently implemented access checks**,\" which directly points to an authorization issue. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary further clarifies this by highlighting the **missing** authorization checks in the `OutputController`.\n\nThe retriever results suggested several potential CWEs, including CWE-285 (Improper Authorization), CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization), CWE-862 (Missing Authorization), CWE-287 (Improper Authentication), and CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key).\n\nBased on the evidence and the CWE specifications, CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) was selected as the primary CWE because it accurately reflects the root cause: the product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n\nCWE-284 (Improper Access Control) was considered but ultimately deemed less specific than CWE-862. While CWE-284 is a broader category encompassing various access control failures, the vulnerability description explicitly indicates a **missing** authorization check, making CWE-862 a more precise fit.\n\nCWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) was also considered, as it addresses the absence of authentication. However, the vulnerability description implies that the affected functionalities require an authenticated user, thus the core issue lies in the **missing** authorization checks after authentication.\n\nCWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key) was considered but not selected because the vulnerability does not specifically involve the modification of a key value to bypass authorization.\n\nThe decision to select CWE-862 is supported by the MITRE mapping guidance, which recommends using more specific child CWEs over general parent CWEs when the evidence supports it.\n\nThe confidence in this mapping is high (0.9) due to the clear and explicit evidence in the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary. The selection of CWE-862 is at the optimal level of specificity, accurately representing the root cause of the vulnerability.",

        "extended_description": "\n\nCross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:\n\n\n  1. Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.\n\n  1. The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.\n\n  1. During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.\n\n  1. A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.\n\n  1. Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.\n\n  1. This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.\n\nThere are three main kinds of XSS:\n\n  -  **Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent)**  - The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.\n\n  -  **Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent)**  - The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs. \n\n  -  **Type 0: DOM-Based XSS**  - In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible. \n\nOnce the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"\n\nIn many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.\n",
