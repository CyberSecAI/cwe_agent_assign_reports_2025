  "description": "In Splunk Enterprise versions 9.3.0, 9.2.3, and 9.1.6, a low-privileged user that does not hold the admin or power Splunk roles could view images on the machine that runs Splunk Enterprise by using the PDF export feature in Splunk classic dashboards. The images on the machine could be exposed by exporting the dashboard as a PDF, using the local image path in the img tag in the source extensible markup language (XML) code for the Splunk classic dashboard.",

    "component": "PDF export feature in Splunk classic dashboards"
  },
  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n\n- The vulnerability stems from how Splunk Enterprise's PDF export feature handles image references within classic dashboards.\n- Specifically, if a low-privileged user creates a classic dashboard that contains an `<img>` tag with a local file path, the PDF export process will include the content of that image file in the exported PDF.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n\n- **Improper Access Control:** Low-privileged users can potentially access files on the Splunk server that they should not have access to.\n- **Path Traversal/Local File Inclusion:** The vulnerability allows inclusion of local files by using the local image path in the img tag in the source XML code for the Splunk classic dashboard.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can gain access to sensitive images or other files stored on the server by including their paths in the img tags of the dashboards and exporting to PDF.\n- The severity is rated as medium because if the server does not contain directories with images, or if Splunk Web is turned off, there will be no impact.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n- **Network:** The attack is performed over the network by a user with access to the Splunk web interface.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n- **Low-Privilege User:** The attacker needs to have a valid Splunk user account with low privileges that allows them to create and edit classic dashboards.\n- **Access to Splunk Web:** The attacker must be able to access the Splunk web interface to create and export dashboards.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n- The vulnerability is mitigated in Splunk Enterprise versions 9.3.1, 9.2.3, and 9.1.6 and later.\n- A detection query is provided to identify potentially vulnerable dashboards.\n- The provided detection logic looks for PDFs being generated and joins that with classic dashboards that contain at least one img tag.",

CWE-668 is a broader class that encompasses the exposure to the wrong sphere, and CWE-497 more specifically highlights the exposure of system information. The relationships influenced the decision to include both the broad CWE-200 and the more specific CWE-497.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    cwe497[\"CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\"]\n    \n    cwe497 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n    cwe668 -->|PARENT| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe668,cwe497 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a low-privileged user creating a classic dashboard with a local image path in an `<img>` tag. This leads to the PDF export feature including the content of that image file in the exported PDF, resulting in the exposure of sensitive information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial analysis considered several CWEs related to information exposure and access control. The final decision focused on CWE-200 as the primary weakness because the core issue is the **exposure of sensitive information** (images) to an unauthorized actor (low-privileged user). However, CWE-668 and CWE-497 were also included to provide additional context regarding the exposure of resources to the wrong sphere, and exposure of sensitive system information.\n\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that \"a low-privileged user that does not hold the admin or power Splunk roles could view images on the machine...by using the PDF export feature.\" This aligns directly with the definition of CWE-200, which involves exposing sensitive information to an unauthorized actor.\n\nThe graph relationships and retriever results influenced the decision to include CWE-668 and CWE-497, as they provide additional context regarding the nature of the exposure. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately represent the root cause and contributing factors of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n*   **CWE-200:** The product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information. This is the core issue in this vulnerability.\n*   **CWE-668:** The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource. The images are resources that should not be accessible to low-privileged users.\n*   **CWE-497:** The product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).

As of CWE 4.9, over 400 CWE entries can lead to a loss of confidentiality. Other options are often available.
