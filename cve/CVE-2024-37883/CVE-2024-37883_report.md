It is recommended that the Nextcloud Deck app is upgraded to 1.6.6 or 1.7.5 or 1.8.7 or 1.9.6 or 1.11.3 or 1.12.1.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Impact:** access comments and attachments of already deleted cards
- **Attacker:** user with access to a deck board
- **Product:** Nextcloud Deck

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary

| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-284 | Improper Access Control | 1.0 | Class | Primary | Allowed-with-Review |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that influenced the decision was the hierarchical structure, specifically focusing on the class-level CWE-284. No chain relationships significantly impacted the selection. The class level was appropriate given the generalized nature of the **improper access control** issue described.

```

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain consists of a single point:
1.  **Improper Access Control (CWE-284)**: The application **fails to properly restrict access** to comments and attachments of deleted cards, leading to unauthorized access.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **improper access control**. The **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** explicitly states, "The primary weakness is the **lack of proper access control checks** on deleted cards." This statement directly supports the selection of CWE-284.

The confidence in this assessment is high (1.0) due to the explicit mention of **improper access control** in the vulnerability description and the alignment with the provided CVE summary. The retriever results also include access control related CWEs such as CWE-639, CWE-863, and CWE-862, but CWE-284 is more general and matches the description better. The selection of CWE-284 at the Class level is appropriate because the description does not provide enough detail to select a more specific Base or Variant CWE related to access control.

The code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-93: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses CRLF (carriage return line feeds) as a special element, e.g. to separate lines or records, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CRLF sequences from inputs.
