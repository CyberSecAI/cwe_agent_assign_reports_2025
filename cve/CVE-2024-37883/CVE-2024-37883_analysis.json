  "description": "Nextcloud Deck is a kanban style organization tool aimed at personal planning and project organization for teams integrated with Nextcloud. A user with access to a deck board was able to access comments and attachments of already deleted cards. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Deck app is upgraded to 1.6.6 or 1.7.5 or 1.8.7 or 1.9.6 or 1.11.3 or 1.12.1.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-37883\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nThe Nextcloud Deck application failed to properly restrict access to comments and attachments associated with deleted cards. This allowed users with access to a deck board to still view information related to cards that had been deleted.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Improper Access Control:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper access control checks on deleted cards. Even though the card was marked as deleted, the application did not prevent access to related comments and attachments.\n- **Data Leakage:** The vulnerability resulted in information disclosure as data associated with deleted cards was still accessible to authorized users.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Confidentiality Breach:** Users with access to the board could view potentially sensitive information contained within comments and attachments of deleted cards.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Network:** An attacker with access to the affected Nextcloud Deck application can access the data via the network.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with access to a deck board.\n- **Low Privileges:** Only low privileges within the application are required.\n- **No User Interaction:** The attack does not require any user interaction from other users.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n- The vulnerability was addressed in versions 1.6.6, 1.7.5, 1.8.7, 1.9.6, 1.11.3, and 1.12.1 of the Nextcloud Deck app.\n- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 4.3.\n- The vulnerability is categorized under CWE-284 (Improper Access Control).\n\nThe provided content offers more detail than the standard CVE description by specifying the exact nature of the vulnerability (access to comments and attachments of deleted cards), the affected and patched versions, and the steps taken to remediate the issue through the associated pull request.",

No chain relationships significantly impacted the selection. The class level was appropriate given the generalized nature of the **improper access control** issue described.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe284 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain consists of a single point:\n1.  **Improper Access Control (CWE-284)**: The application **fails to properly restrict access** to comments and attachments of deleted cards, leading to unauthorized access.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **improper access control**. The **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** explicitly states, \"The primary weakness is the **lack of proper access control checks** on deleted cards.\" This statement directly supports the selection of CWE-284.\n\nThe confidence in this assessment is high (1.0) due to the explicit mention of **improper access control** in the vulnerability description and the alignment with the provided CVE summary. The retriever results also include access control related CWEs such as CWE-639, CWE-863, and CWE-862, but CWE-284 is more general and matches the description better. The selection of CWE-284 at the Class level is appropriate because the description does not provide enough detail to select a more specific Base or Variant CWE related to access control.\n\nRelevant
