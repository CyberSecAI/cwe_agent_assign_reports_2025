## Vulnerability Description
Team ENVY, a Security Research TEAM has found a flaw that allows for a remote code execution on the NVR. The seed string for the encrypt key was hardcoding. The manufacturer has released patch firmware for the flaw, please refer to the manufacturers report for details and workarounds.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** remote code execution
- **product:** NVR

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of CVE-2024-41885:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The seed string used for generating the encryption key is hardcoded within the NVR firmware.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Hardcoding of sensitive information (the seed string).
- Potential for the firmware decryption key to be reproduced if the seed string is leaked.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- If the hardcoded seed string is discovered (through reverse engineering), an attacker could potentially reproduce the NVR firmware decryption key. This could allow them to decrypt the NVR's firmware for further analysis or malicious purposes.
- The document notes that reverse engineering is required and is a difficult task, making this vulnerability low priority.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Reverse engineering of the NVR firmware to extract the hardcoded seed string.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Access to the NVR firmware.
- Ability to perform reverse engineering and analysis of the firmware.
