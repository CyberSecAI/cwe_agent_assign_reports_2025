While there isn't enough information to pinpoint a more specific Base variant, the vulnerability clearly involves **missing authorization**.\nCWE-280 and CWE-306 were considered as possible alternatives or contributing factors but were deemed less directly applicable based on the limited information available. CWE-280 could be present if the system doesn't properly handle cases where the user doesn't have enough privileges.
