## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's the analysis:

The content from both github.com files appears to be identical and describes a vulnerability in the `bootplus` project where the file upload functionality does not filter uploaded files, which allows the upload of malicious files such as JSP and HTML Trojans.

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The upload method in `SysFileController.java` does not validate the uploaded files.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unrestricted file upload, allowing the upload of executable code (JSP, HTML).
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to the execution of arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to remote code execution (RCE).
*   **Attack vectors:** Uploading a malicious file (e.g., HTML or JSP file containing a script) through the `/file/upload` endpoint.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application and the ability to send HTTP POST requests with the malicious file.
*   **Mitigation or fix:** The content does not include mitigation or a fix.
