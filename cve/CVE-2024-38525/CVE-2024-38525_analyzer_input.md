# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-38525

## Vulnerability Description
dd-trace-cpp is the Datadog distributed tracing for C++. When the library fails to extract trace context due to malformed unicode, it logs the list of audited headers and their values using the `nlohmann` JSON library. However, due to the way the JSON library is invoked, it throws an **uncaught exception**, which results in a crash. This vulnerability has been patched in version 0.2.2.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **uncaught exception**
- **impact:** crash
- **vector:** malformed unicode
- **product:** dd-trace-cpp
- **version:** before 0.2.2

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The `dd-trace-cpp` library attempts to log the list of audited headers and their values using the `nlohmann` JSON library when it fails to extract trace context due to malformed unicode. This logging process can throw an uncaught exception.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Uncaught Exception:** The code uses `nlohmann::json` to parse header key-value pairs for logging. Both parsing and the implicit `dump()` call on the JSON object can throw exceptions, which are not caught and can lead to program termination.
- **Malformed Unicode Handling:** The library doesn't properly handle malformed unicode in header values. Specifically, when logging, it attempts to create JSON from header values without proper validation or sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Application Crash:** Downstream applications that rely on `dd-trace-cpp` for tracing may crash due to the uncaught exception thrown during logging, leading to a denial-of-service.

**Attack Vectors:**

- Sending HTTP requests with malformed unicode in header values to an application using the vulnerable `dd-trace-cpp` library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- An attacker needs to be able to send requests with crafted headers to the vulnerable application.
- No special privileges or user interaction is required to trigger this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is triggered during a logging attempt within the `dd-trace-cpp` library when it encounters malformed unicode header values.
- The `nlohmann::json` library is used in a way that may cause uncaught exceptions due to invalid input for the library.
- This vulnerability affects versions v0.1.12, v0.2.0, and v0.2.1 of `dd-trace-cpp`.
- The vulnerability is fixed in version v0.2.2.
- A workaround is to filter out header values that are not valid UTF-8 strings.
- The CVSS score is 6.2 with the vector `CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H`, indicating a high availability impact but no confidentiality or integrity issues. The attack vector is "local", which in this case means that the vulnerability is triggered through communication with the vulnerable application.
