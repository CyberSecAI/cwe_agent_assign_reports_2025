  "description": "dd-trace-cpp is the Datadog distributed tracing for C++. When the library fails to extract trace context due to malformed unicode, it logs the list of audited headers and their values using the `nlohmann` JSON library. However, due to the way the JSON library is invoked, it throws an **uncaught exception**, which results in a crash. This vulnerability has been patched in version 0.2.2.",

  },
  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n\n- The `dd-trace-cpp` library attempts to log the list of audited headers and their values using the `nlohmann` JSON library when it fails to extract trace context due to malformed unicode. This logging process can throw an uncaught exception.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n\n- **Uncaught Exception:** The code uses `nlohmann::json` to parse header key-value pairs for logging. Both parsing and the implicit `dump()` call on the JSON object can throw exceptions, which are not caught and can lead to program termination.\n- **Malformed Unicode Handling:** The library doesn't properly handle malformed unicode in header values. Specifically, when logging, it attempts to create JSON from header values without proper validation or sanitization.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n- **Application Crash:** Downstream applications that rely on `dd-trace-cpp` for tracing may crash due to the uncaught exception thrown during logging, leading to a denial-of-service.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n- Sending HTTP requests with malformed unicode in header values to an application using the vulnerable `dd-trace-cpp` library.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n- An attacker needs to be able to send requests with crafted headers to the vulnerable application.\n- No special privileges or user interaction is required to trigger this vulnerability.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n- The vulnerability is triggered during a logging attempt within the `dd-trace-cpp` library when it encounters malformed unicode header values.\n- The `nlohmann::json` library is used in a way that may cause uncaught exceptions due to invalid input for the library.\n- This vulnerability affects versions v0.1.12, v0.2.0, and v0.2.1 of `dd-trace-cpp`.\n- The vulnerability is fixed in version v0.2.2.\n- A workaround is to filter out header values that are not valid UTF-8 strings.\n- The CVSS score is 6.2 with the vector `CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H`, indicating a high availability impact but no confidentiality or integrity issues. The attack vector is \"local\", which in this case means that the vulnerability is triggered through communication with the vulnerable application.",

However, based on the evidence, CWE-248 adequately describes the vulnerability. There were no other relationships that appeared relevant.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe248[\"CWE-248: Uncaught Exception\"]\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe248 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the processing of malformed unicode, leading to the use of the `nlohmann` JSON library, which then results in an **uncaught exception**, which leads to the application crash.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE identified is CWE-248 (**Uncaught Exception**). This is based on the vulnerability description and the CVE reference links summary which states the root cause is the **uncaught exception**. The `nlohmann::json` library is used in a way that causes uncaught exceptions due to invalid input, leading to program termination. This aligns directly with the definition of CWE-248.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this
