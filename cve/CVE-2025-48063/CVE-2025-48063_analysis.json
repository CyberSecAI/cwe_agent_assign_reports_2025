  "cve_id": "CVE-2025-48063",
  "description": "XWiki is a generic wiki platform. In XWiki 16.10.0, required rights were introduced as a way to limit which rights a document can have. Part of the security model of required rights is that a user who doesnt have a right also cannot define that right as required right. That way, users who are editing documents on which required rights are enforced can be sure that theyre not giving a right to a script or object that it didnt have before. A bug in the implementation of the enforcement of this rule means that in fact, it was possible for any user with edit right on a document to set programming right as required right. If then a user with programming right edited that document, the content of that document would gain programming right, allowing remote code execution. This thereby defeats most of the security benefits of required rights. As XWiki still performs the required rights analysis when a user edits a page even when required rights are enforced, the user with programming right would still be warned about the dangerous content unless the attacker managed to bypass this check. Note also that none of the affected versions include a UI for enabling the enforcing of required rights so it seems unlikely that anybody relied on them for security in the affected versions. As this vulnerability provides no additional attack surface unless all documents in the wiki enforce required rights, we consider the impact of this attack to be low even though gaining programming right could have a high impact. This vulnerability has been patched in XWiki 16.10.4 and 17.1.0RC1. No known workarounds are available except for upgrading.",

While it's generally preferable to use Base-level CWEs, the provided information specifically points to an authorization issue, and no specific details are provided to narrow it down to a more specific Base-level CWE. The Retriever results also suggest this CWE with high confidence.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe863 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **incorrect authorization**, allowing users with edit rights to set programming rights as required rights. This leads to a privilege escalation, potentially resulting in remote code execution if a user with programming rights then edits the document. The root cause is the **bug in the implementation of the enforcement of required rights.**\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-863 as the most appropriate CWE. This is based on the vulnerability description which states a \"**bug in the implementation of the enforcement of required rights** means that in fact, it was possible for any user with edit right on a document to set programming right as required right\". This aligns directly with **CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization)**, where the authorization check is not correctly performed, allowing privilege escalation.\n\nThe relationship graph shows the single CWE as the primary one.\n\nThe confidence is high because the evidence clearly indicates an authorization flaw, and the CWE aligns well with the vulnerability description. While more specific CWEs might exist, the provided information does not allow for a more granular classification.\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
