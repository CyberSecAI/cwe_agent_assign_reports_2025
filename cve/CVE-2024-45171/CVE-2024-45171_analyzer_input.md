# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-45171

## Vulnerability Description
An issue was discovered in za-internet C-MOR Video Surveillance 5.2401. Due to **improper user input validation**, it is possible to upload dangerous files, for instance PHP code, to the C-MOR system. By analyzing the C-MOR web interface, it was found out that the upload functionality for backup files allows an authenticated user to upload arbitrary files. The only condition is that the filename contains a .cbkf string. Therefore, webshell.cbkf.php is considered a valid file name for the C-MOR web application. Uploaded files are stored within the directory /srv/www/backups on the C-MOR system, and can thus be accessed via the URL https///backup/upload_. Due to broken access control, low-privileged authenticated users can also use this file upload functionality.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **improper user input validation**
- **impact:** upload dangerous files
- **attacker:** authenticated user
- **product:** za-internet C-MOR Video Surveillance
- **version:** 5.2401

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-45171

**Root Cause:** Improper user input validation in the C-MOR Video Surveillance web interface's backup file upload functionality.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Unrestricted File Upload (CWE-434):** The system allows uploading files with dangerous types, such as PHP code, without proper validation of the file content or type.
*   **Insufficient File Name Validation:** The only validation is that the file name contains the string ".cbkf".
*   **Broken Access Control:** Low-privileged authenticated users can also use this file upload functionality (as described in SYSS-2024-024).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can upload a PHP web shell to the server and execute arbitrary OS commands.
*   **System Compromise:** Successful exploitation can lead to complete system compromise of the C-MOR video surveillance system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is exploitable through the C-MOR web interface's backup file upload feature.
*   **Network Access:** The web interface is accessible via the network and the internet.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user (even a low-privileged one).
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the C-MOR system's web interface.

**Technical Details:**
*   The upload functionality for backup files allows the upload of arbitrary files if the filename contains ".cbkf"
*   Uploaded files are stored in the `/srv/www/backups` directory on the C-MOR system.
*   The uploaded files can be accessed via the URL `https://<HOST>/backup/upload_<FILENAME>`.
*   The provided proof of concept (PoC) uses a simple PHP web shell for command execution.

**Mitigation:**
*   Upgrade to C-MOR Video Surveillance version 6.00PL1.

This information is more detailed than the basic description usually found in a CVE record. It provides a clear picture of how the vulnerability can be exploited and the impact it can have on a vulnerable system.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control

**Authentication**:
Determines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.

* Example phrases: "user must log in", "lack of login check", "bypasses login"
* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.

  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* – used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).

**Authorization**:
Determines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do. It decides access *after* identity is verified.

* Example phrases: "unauthorized access", "regular user can access admin panel", "role checks are missing"
* CWE relevance: use CWEs like 862, 863, 285 for authorization errors:

  * **CWE-862**: *Missing Authorization* – the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all.
  * **CWE-863**: *Incorrect Authorization* – the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).
  * **CWE-285**: *Improper Authorization* – general category for any flawed authorization logic or design.

**Access Control**:
A broader term that includes both authentication and authorization. Governs how resources are protected and who can access them under what conditions.

* CWE relevance:

  * **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* – top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear.
  * This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.

## Mapping Discussion – Common Misclassification Patterns

### 1. **CWE-306 vs CWE-862**:

* **306** is about lack of **authentication** (e.g., *no login required at all*).
* **862** is about lack of **authorization** *after* authentication (e.g., *admin check missing*).
* ✅ Example CWE-306: *“An unauthenticated attacker can invoke the password reset API.”*
* ✅ Example CWE-862: *“An authenticated user without admin privileges can delete any user account.”*

### 2. **CWE-285 vs CWE-284**:

* **285** is specific to authorization flaws – it's a better choice than 284 **if** the issue involves *improper or missing role checks*.
* **284** should be reserved for general access control issues when it’s unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.

---

## Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification

**Phrase like "unauthorized access" is not enough.**

* If you **cannot determine whether identity was checked**, assume it’s **authorization** and consider 862 or 863.
* If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** → CWE-306.
* If the **access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced**, but it's not due to missing checks, consider **CWE-284**.

---

## Good Mapping Examples

* ✅ **CWE-306**: “The endpoint `/admin/deleteUser` does not require any authentication.”
* ✅ **CWE-862**: “Any logged-in user can change any other user's email without being an admin.”
* ✅ **CWE-863**: “An admin check exists but incorrectly grants access to non-admin users.”
* ✅ **CWE-285**: “Application uses a static role check that fails when roles change dynamically.”
* ✅ **CWE-284**: “Inconsistent enforcement of access rules across services with unclear policy source.”

| Role check is present but flawed                           | CWE-863        |
| General or ambiguous authorization failure                 | CWE-285        |
