  "query": "Vulnerability in the Oracle Applications Technology Stack product of Oracle E-Business Suite (component Configuration). Supported versions that are affected are 12.2.3-12.2.14. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with logon to the infrastructure where Oracle Applications Technology Stack executes to compromise Oracle Applications Technology Stack. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Oracle Applications Technology Stack accessible data as well as unauthorized read access to a subset of Oracle Applications Technology Stack accessible data.
