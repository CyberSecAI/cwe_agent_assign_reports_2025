While more specific CWEs could potentially be identified with more information, the provided description focuses on the general lack of input validation. CWE-20 can lead to many different outcomes, one of which is information disclosure (CWE-200). Therefore, CWE-20 is considered the root cause, and CWE-200 is the impact.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n\n    cwe200 -- CANFOLLOW --> cwe20\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe20 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **Improper Input Validation** (CWE-20).
