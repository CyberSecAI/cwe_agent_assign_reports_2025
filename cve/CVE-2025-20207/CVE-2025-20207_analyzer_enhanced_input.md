## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability in Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) polling for Cisco Secure Email and Web Manager, Cisco Secure Email Gateway, and Cisco Secure Web Appliance could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to obtain confidential information about the underlying operating system. This vulnerability exists because the **appliances do not protect confidential information at rest in response to SNMP poll requests**. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted SNMP poll request to the affected appliance. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to discover confidential information that should be restricted. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have the configured SNMP credentials.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **component:** SNMP polling
- **rootcause:** **appliances do not protect confidential information at rest in response to SNMP poll requests**
- **vector:** crafted SNMP poll request
- **product:** Cisco Secure Email and Web Manager, Cisco Secure Email Gateway, Cisco Secure Web Appliance
- **impact:** obtain confidential information about the underlying operating system
- **attacker:** authenticated remote attacker
