Other CWEs Considered but Not Used:

*   CWE-425 (Direct Request 'Forced Browsing'): While related to authorization issues, it doesn't specifically address the CSRF vulnerability.
*   CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function): While CSRF can be seen as a type of authentication bypass, CWE-352 is more specific to the vulnerability.
*   CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')): This is not relevant as it is not about XSS.
