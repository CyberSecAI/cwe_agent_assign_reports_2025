## Vulnerability Description
The AsyncHttpClient (AHC) library allows Java applications to easily execute HTTP requests and asynchronously process HTTP responses. When making any HTTP request, the automatically enabled and **self-managed CookieStore** (aka cookie jar) will silently replace explicitly defined Cookies with any that have the same name from the cookie jar. For services that operate with multiple users, this can result in one users Cookie being used for another users requests.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **self-managed CookieStore**
- **impact:** use one user's Cookie for another user's requests
- **product:** AsyncHttpClient

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-53990:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `CookieStore` in the AsyncHttpClient library automatically and silently replaces explicitly defined cookies in an HTTP request with cookies of the same name from the cookie jar. This occurs because the library uses `addOrReplaceCookie()` instead of `addCookieIfUnset()`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Cookie Handling:** The library's `CookieStore` overwrites explicitly set cookies with those from its internal store, leading to unexpected behavior.
- **Lack of Prioritization:**  Explicitly defined cookies should take precedence over those stored in the cookie jar, but this is not the case in the vulnerable versions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Session Hijacking:** In services with multiple users, an attacker could potentially cause one user's cookie to be used for another user's requests.
- **Data Exposure:** This can lead to the exposure of sensitive user data or other information if the application does not reject requests with incorrect authentication.
- **Broken Third-party Auth:** If a service uses third-party auth and token refresh mechanisms, this vulnerability can break the auth process due to the cookie replacement.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is primarily network-based. An attacker doesn't need specific user privileges or interaction.
- An attacker would need to control a request which contains the same cookie name as one stored in the client's cookie store.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-  An attacker would need to have the ability to make HTTP requests via the vulnerable AsyncHttpClient implementation.
-  They need to be able to induce an action that results in the `CookieStore` containing a cookie with the same name as one they wish to inject.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
- The issue was initially reported as a bug, not as a security vulnerability.
- A fix was implemented to only set cookies from the `CookieStore` if they are not already set by the request.
- A workaround exists by disabling the `CookieStore` during client creation.
-  The vulnerability affects AsyncHttpClient versions >= 2.1.0, < 2.12.4 and >= 3.0.0.Beta1, < 3.0.1.
- Patched versions are 2.12.4 and 3.0.1.
- The vulnerability is rated as critical with a CVSS score of 9.2.
- The vulnerability is tracked as GHSA-mfj5-cf8g-g2fv.
- The vulnerability has been mitigated in Apache Pulsar by disabling CookieStore as a short term mitigation strategy. A full upgrade to a fixed version of `async-http-client` will be needed.
