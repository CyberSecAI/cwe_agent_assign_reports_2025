  "description": "Vulnerability in the MySQL Server product of Oracle MySQL (component InnoDB). Supported versions that are affected are 8.0.38 and prior, 8.4.1 and prior and 9.0.1 and prior. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows high privileged attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise MySQL Server. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability to cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS) of MySQL Server.

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-21207:\n\n**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**\n   - The provided content from both `www.oracle.com` and `security.netapp.com` directly reference CVE-2024-21207.\n   - The Oracle document lists it in the \"Oracle MySQL Risk Matrix\" section.\n   - The NetApp document has the title: `CVE-2024-21207 MySQL Server Vulnerability in NetApp Products`\n\n**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n   - The vulnerability lies within the InnoDB component of the MySQL server.\n\n**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n   - The vulnerability allows for a complete Denial of Service (DOS) of the MySQL Server. This is achieved by triggering a hang or a frequently repeatable crash.\n\n**4. Impact of Exploitation:**\n   - Successful exploitation results in a Denial of Service, causing the MySQL server to become unavailable. This can disrupt any applications or services relying on that MySQL instance.\n\n**5. Attack Vectors:**\n   - The attack vector is through the MySQL Protocol, meaning an attacker would need network access to the MySQL server.\n   - While the Oracle document states it is not remotely exploitable without authentication, NetApp lists it as exploitable with high privileges.\n\n**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n   - Based on Oracle's risk matrix, a network attacker would need high privileges (e.g., `Create Session`, potentially some other privilege based on the different products and components).\n   - Based on NetApp's advisory, attackers need to have high privileges.\n\n**Technical Details:**\n\n*   **Oracle:** The vulnerability affects MySQL Server versions prior to 8.0.39, 8.4.2 and 9.0.1\n*   **NetApp:** The vulnerability impacts MySQL Server versions through 8.0.38, 8.4.1, and 9.0.1\n*   **CVSS v3.1:** 4.9 (MEDIUM), Vector: `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H`\n\n**Summary of Findings**\n\nThe vulnerability (CVE-2024-21207) exists in the InnoDB component of MySQL Server, allowing an attacker with sufficient privileges to cause a complete Denial of Service. This is achieved by triggering a hang or crash on the MySQL Server.\n\nThe vulnerability affects various versions of MySQL Server, including those embedded in NetApp products. The CVSS score indicates a medium severity vulnerability that requires a network attacker with administrative-level privileges to trigger.",

The selection of CWE-770 is further supported by its Base level of abstraction, which is preferred for mapping root causes. The final decision emphasizes the resource allocation aspect as the primary weakness, directly causing the denial-of-service condition.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component. Without sufficient removal or quoting of SQL syntax in user-controllable inputs, the generated SQL query can cause those inputs to be interpreted as SQL instead of ordinary user data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 1080.62\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates a reusable resource or group of resources on behalf of an actor without imposing any restrictions on the size or number of resources that can be allocated, in violation of the intended security policy for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nCWE-770 is chosen because the vulnerability allows for a complete Denial of Service (DOS) of the MySQL Server due to a hang or frequently repeatable crash, indicating a resource exhaustion issue. The vulnerability occurs because resources are allocated without proper limits or throttling.\n\n\n## CWE Relationship Analysis\n\nCurrent CWEs represent these abstraction levels: .\n\n\n### Vulnerability Chain Analysis\n\n**Chain starting from CWE-89:**\n- 89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')) - ROOT\n\n\n**Chain starting from CWE-400:**\n- 400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) - ROOT\n\n\n\n### CWE Relationship Diagram\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n```",
