The specific capabilities and position required are not detailed in the provided text.\n\nThe content also lists the affected Exynos chipsets, which include: Exynos 9820, 9825, 980, 990, 850, 1080, 2100, 1280, 2200, 1330, 1380, 1480, 2400, 9110, W920, W930, Modem 5123, and Modem 5300.

The vulnerability description explicitly mentions both a **heap buffer overflow** leading to a **USAT out-of-bounds write**, so both CWEs are relevant. CWE-122 is a variant of a more general buffer overflow, focusing specifically on the heap. The abstraction levels guided the choice, preferring the base level CWE-787 and variant level CWE-122.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe122[\"CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe122 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe787\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe122 secondary\n    class cwe119 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **heap buffer overflow** (CWE-122). This overflow allows an attacker to write data outside the intended boundaries of the buffer, leading to an **out-of-bounds write** (CWE-787). The final impact is a Denial of Service.\n*   CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow (Root Cause)\n*   CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write (Weakness)\n*   Denial of Service (Impact)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability is classified as CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) as the primary CWE, with CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) as a secondary contributing factor. This assessment is based on the vulnerability description and CVE reference summary, which explicitly state a **heap buffer overflow** leading to an **out-of-bounds write**. The relationship analysis confirms that out-of-bounds write is a common consequence of heap buffer overflows.\n\nThe selection of CWE-787 as primary and CWE-122 as a contributing factor reflects the understanding that the overflow is the mechanism and the out-of-bounds write is the direct cause of the vulnerability. The abstraction levels are appropriate as CWE-787 is a base level CWE and CWE-122 is a variant.
