However, XSS vulnerabilities typically allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n*   The attack vector is through web pages served by the Micro Focus Access Manager. The attacker injects malicious scripts that are then executed in the victim's browser.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n*   An attacker needs the ability to inject malicious scripts into a web page served by Micro Focus Access Manager. This typically involves finding input fields or other areas where user-controlled data is not properly sanitized.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n*   The release notes mention that this vulnerability is resolved in Access Manager 5.0 Service Pack 4 Patch 1 and Access Manager 5.1 (24.2).\n*   The provided text does not specify the location or type of the XSS vulnerabilities and only references an external KB article for more information.",

In this case, it leads to **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** (CWE-79). CWE-20 is a Class-level CWE, while CWE-79 is a Base-level CWE. CWE-79 can be a consequence of CWE-20 when the **improperly validated input** is used in a web page.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    \n    cwe79 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe20\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe20 primary\n    class cwe79 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **Improper Input Validation** (CWE-20). Because the input is not properly validated, it is then used in a way that leads to **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** (CWE-79).\n\n`Improper Input Validation (CWE-20) -> Cross-Site Scripting (CWE-79)`\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the presence of both **Improper Input Validation** and **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**. The description clearly states that an \"**Improper Input Validation** vulnerability in OpenText NetIQ Access Manager leads to **Cross-Site Scripting** (XSS) attack.\" The root cause is the **Improper Input Validation** (CWE-20) which leads to the **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** (CWE-79).\n\nCWE-20 is chosen as the primary CWE because it represents the root cause of the vulnerability. The subsequent **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** is a direct consequence of this **improper input validation**. While CWE-20 is a Class-level CWE and is generally discouraged, in this case, the description does not offer more details about the **input validation** that is missing, so a more specific CWE is not possible.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Why Not Used:** While XSS is the impact, this CWE is about the specifics of HTML tags and is too specific given the general description.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n**Why Not Used:** This is too general and the vulnerability is more specific about XSS.\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Why Not Used:** This vulnerability is not related to authentication.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Why Not Used:** While related to input, the description focuses on the lack of validation itself, rather than a flawed security decision.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.\n\n**Why Not Used:** This is not about resource exposure.\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Why Not Used:** This is not about information exposure.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
