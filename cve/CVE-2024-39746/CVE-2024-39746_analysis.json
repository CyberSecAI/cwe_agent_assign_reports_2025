The **failure to properly enable HTTP Strict Transport Security** leads to data being transmitted in cleartext. |\n| CWE-614 | Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute | 0.7 | Variant | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The **failure to properly enable HTTP Strict Transport Security** could lead to sensitive cookies being transmitted without the 'Secure' attribute. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-319, which directly relates to the cleartext transmission of sensitive information due to the **failure to enable HSTS**. CWE-614 is a variant that focuses on the specific case of sensitive cookies being transmitted without the 'Secure' attribute in HTTPS sessions, which is a potential consequence of not enforcing HSTS.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe614[\"CWE-614: Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute\"]\n\n    cwe614 -->|CHILDOF| cwe319\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe319 primary\n    class cwe614 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **failure to properly enable HTTP Strict Transport Security**, leading to cleartext transmission of sensitive information, and potentially insecure cookies.\n  - Root Cause: **Failure to properly enable HTTP Strict Transport Security**\n  - Weakness: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information (CWE-319)\n  - Impact: Potential exposure of sensitive information via man-in-the-middle attacks.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-319 as the primary weakness, stemming from the **failure to enable HTTP Strict Transport Security**, which results in data being transmitted in cleartext. The description explicitly mentions the potential for man-in-the-middle attacks, which aligns with the implications of CWE-319. CWE-614 was also considered as a secondary weakness, as the **failure to properly enable HTTP Strict Transport Security** could leave sensitive cookies vulnerable.\n\nThe vulnerability description indicates a **failure to properly enable HTTP Strict Transport Security**, which leads to sensitive information being transmitted in cleartext. This aligns directly with CWE-319, \"Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information.\" The evidence is found in the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section, which states that the root cause is a \"**failure to properly enable HTTP Strict Transport Security**\".\n\nThe relationship graph shows that CWE-614 is a child of CWE-319, which further supports the decision to include both CWEs. CWE-319 is the root cause, and CWE-614 is a specific instance of the vulnerability related to cookies.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately represent the weakness described in the vulnerability.
