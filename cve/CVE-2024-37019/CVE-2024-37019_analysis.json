  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2024-37019:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n- A bug in the authentication code of Mender Enterprise allows for the creation of duplicate users when integrating with an external SAML service.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- The vulnerability lies in the way Mender handles authentication when using an external SAML service. Specifically, the system fails to properly prevent the creation of duplicate users, which can be abused to impersonate existing users.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- **Account takeover:** An attacker can create duplicate user accounts and use them to take over existing user accounts in other tenants in a multi-tenant setup of Mender Enterprise. This includes accounts using username/password, even with TOTP 2FA enabled.\n- **Compromised tenant separation, RBAC, and authentication:** In a multi-tenant environment, the vulnerability compromises the security of tenant separation and role-based access control (RBAC), allowing an attacker to gain unauthorized access across different tenants.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- The attack vector is through an external SAML service integrated with a Mender tenant.\n- An attacker would need an authenticated user account with the ability to manage users in the third-party SAML service or with the ability to setup SAML in Mender.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- The attacker needs to have an authenticated account with sufficient privileges to either manage users in the external SAML service or configure SAML settings within the Mender platform.\n- The attacker needs to be able to create duplicate users via the SAML integration.\n\n**Additional Details**\n- The vulnerability primarily affects multi-tenant Mender Enterprise setups. In single-tenant environments, the impact is less severe as an administrator already possesses extensive capabilities.\n- The vulnerability was responsibly disclosed by an external security researcher.\n- Patches have been released for Hosted Mender, and for Mender Enterprise on-prem versions 3.6.4 and 3.7.4.",
