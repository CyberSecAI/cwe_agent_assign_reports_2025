A maliciouly crafted filesystem may lead some of those buffer size calculation to overflow, causing it to perform a grub_malloc() operation with a smaller size than expected. As a result the hfsplus_open_compressed_real() function will write past of the internal buffer length. This flaw may be leveraged to corrupt grubs internal critical data and may result in arbitrary code execution by-passing secure boot protections.
