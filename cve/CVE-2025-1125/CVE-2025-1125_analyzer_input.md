# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-1125

## Vulnerability Description
When reading data from a hfs filesystem, grubs hfs filesystem module uses user-controlled parameters from the filesystem metadata to calculate the internal buffers size, however it misses to properly check for **integer overflow**s. A maliciouly crafted filesystem may lead some of those **buffer size calculation** to overflow, causing it to perform a grub_malloc() operation with a smaller size than expected. As a result the hfsplus_open_compressed_real() function will write past of the internal buffer length. This flaw may be leveraged to corrupt grubs internal critical data and may result in arbitrary code execution by-passing secure boot protections.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **component:** hfs filesystem module
- **rootcause:** **integer overflow**
- **vector:** maliciouly crafted filesystem
- **weakness:** **buffer size calculation**
- **product:** grub
- **impact:** ['arbitrary code execution', 'buffer size calculation', 'write past of the internal buffer length']

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
CVE-2025-1125

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The grub2 HFS filesystem module uses user-controlled parameters from filesystem metadata to calculate internal buffer sizes without proper integer overflow checks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Integer overflow leading to a heap-based out-of-bounds write.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Corruption of grub's internal critical data, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution and bypassing secure boot protections.

**Attack vectors:**
A maliciously crafted HFS filesystem.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
Ability to create a malicious HFS filesystem.

**Mitigation or fix:**
The patchset includes fixes for this vulnerability. Updating GRUB2, shim, and other boot artifacts from affected vendors is required. Applying the latest SBAT (Secure Boot Advanced Targeting) data is also necessary.

**Additional details:**
The bug report (Bug 2346138) links to a Red Hat security advisory for CVE-2025-1125.
The vulnerability is present in the `hfsplus_open_compressed_real()` function.
