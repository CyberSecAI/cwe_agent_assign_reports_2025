  "query": "When reading data from a hfs filesystem, grubs hfs filesystem module uses user-controlled parameters from the filesystem metadata to calculate the internal buffers size, however it misses to properly check for integer overflows. A maliciouly crafted filesystem may lead some of those buffer size calculation to overflow, causing it to perform a grub_malloc() operation with a smaller size than expected. As a result the hfsplus_open_compressed_real() function will write past of the internal buffer length. This flaw may be leveraged to corrupt grubs internal critical data and may result in arbitrary code execution by-passing secure boot protections.",
