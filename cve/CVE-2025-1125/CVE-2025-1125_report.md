# Analysis Report for CVE-2025-1125

# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2025-1125

## Description

When reading data from a hfs filesystem, grubs hfs filesystem module uses user-controlled parameters from the filesystem metadata to calculate the internal buffers size, however it misses to properly check for **integer overflow**s. A maliciouly crafted filesystem may lead some of those **buffer size calculation** to overflow, causing it to perform a grub_malloc() operation with a smaller size than expected. As a result the hfsplus_open_compressed_real() function will write past of the internal buffer length. This flaw may be leveraged to corrupt grubs internal critical data and may result in arbitrary code execution by-passing secure boot protections.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Component:** hfs filesystem module
- **Rootcause:** integer overflow
- **Vector:** maliciouly crafted filesystem

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is identified as CWE-190, Integer Overflow or Wraparound, which is a base-level CWE. This can lead to CWE-131, Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size, which in turn can precede CWE-787, Out-of-bounds Write. The analysis focuses on identifying the root cause (integer overflow) and the immediate consequence (incorrect buffer size calculation) that leads to the exploitable out-of-bounds write. The relationships show a clear progression of the vulnerability.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) due to the **missing** or **improper** checks in the HFS filesystem module. This leads to CWE-131 (Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size), causing a smaller buffer to be allocated than needed. Finally, this results in CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) when the `hfsplus_open_compressed_real()` function writes past the allocated buffer.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis identified the **integer overflow** as the root cause, based on the "Vulnerability Description Key Phrases" and "CVE Reference Links Content Summary". The "Retriever Results" also ranked CWE-190 as the top candidate. The vulnerability description clearly states that the HFS filesystem module **misses to properly check for integer overflows** when calculating internal buffer sizes. This leads to an incorrect buffer size calculation and subsequent out-of-bounds write. The selection of CWE-190 as the primary CWE is based on this direct evidence.

The relationship graph shows how the integer overflow can lead to an incorrect buffer size calculation and ultimately to an out-of-bounds write. The CWEs are selected at the base level to provide a specific representation of the weaknesses.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product performs a calculation that can
         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic
         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than
         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is
         incremented to a value that is too large to store in the
         associated representation. When this occurs, the value may
         become a very small or negative number.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-193: Off-by-one Error
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A product calculates or uses an incorrect maximum or minimum value that is 1 more, or 1 less, than the correct value.

**Mapping Guidance**:
