The vulnerability is described as a buffer overflow. |\n| CWE-119 | Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer | 0.7 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary candidate. Generic description of memory buffer issues. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-120, which is a base-level CWE that specifically describes buffer copies without checking the size of the input. CWE-119 is a more general class that describes improper restriction of operations within memory buffers, making CWE-120 a more specific and appropriate choice.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe120[\"CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    \n    cwe120 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe120 primary\n    class cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is simple: a buffer overflow occurs due to a buffer copy operation without checking the size of the input, leading to potential remote code execution. The root cause is the **missing** size check before copying data into a buffer.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-120, \"Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')\". The vulnerability description explicitly states that the issue is a **buffer overflow** in the REST Command Handler of PCMan FTP Server 2.0.7. The description highlights that the manipulation leads to a **buffer overflow**. The selection of CWE-120 is justified because it accurately describes the **root cause** of the vulnerability which involves copying data into a buffer without validating the size of the input.\n\nCWE-119, \"Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\", was considered but determined to be too general. While a **buffer overflow** falls under the umbrella of CWE-119, CWE-120 provides a more specific description of the vulnerability.\n\nThe evidence from the vulnerability description is strong, with direct mention of a **buffer overflow**. The relationship analysis confirms that CWE-120 is a more specific child of CWE-119. The mapping guidance for CWE-120 suggests a review, but given the explicit mention of a **buffer overflow** and the nature of the vulnerability, it is deemed the most appropriate choice.\n\nRelevant
