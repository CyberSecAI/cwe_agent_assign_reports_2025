By setting specific parameters, an attacker can execute unauthorized arbitrary code on the server, causing severe harm. The vulnerability is triggered when the args-number parameter is greater than 1, leading to automatic deserialization and arbitrary code execution.",

CWE-502 and CWE-94 are peers in that they both can result from improper control of code resources.

The vulnerability description clearly states that the issue is triggered by setting specific parameters, leading to automatic deserialization and arbitrary code execution. This aligns directly with the definition of CWE-502, which involves deserializing untrusted data without proper validation, potentially leading to code execution.\n\nThe selection of CWE-502 as the primary CWE is based on the explicit mention of **deserialization vulnerability** in the vulnerability description.\n\nCWE-94 (Improper Control of Generation of Code) is considered as a secondary CWE because the deserialization process directly leads to the ability to generate and execute arbitrary code.
