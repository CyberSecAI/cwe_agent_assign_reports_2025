  "description": "The wpForo Forum plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the slug attribute of the wpforo shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 2.3.3 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-3200:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\n*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and lack of proper SQL query preparation when handling the 'slug' attribute within the 'wpforo' shortcode. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The plugin fails to adequately sanitize user-supplied input ('slug' attribute) before incorporating it into a SQL query.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation can lead to the extraction of sensitive information from the WordPress database by appending additional SQL queries to existing ones.\n*  **Data Modification or Deletion**: Although not explicitly stated, SQL injection can also potentially lead to unauthorized modification or deletion of data, which represents a high-impact scenario.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   The attack vector is through the 'wpforo' shortcode, specifically by manipulating the 'slug' attribute.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Authentication:** The attacker must be authenticated with at least contributor-level access to a WordPress site. This implies they need a valid user account with the ability to create or modify content that uses the vulnerable shortcode.\n*   **Shortcode Usage:** The attacker needs to be able to insert and use the 'wpforo' shortcode with a malicious 'slug' attribute.\n\n**Summary of Vulnerability:**\n\nThe wpForo Forum plugin is vulnerable to SQL injection. An authenticated attacker (contributor level or higher) can exploit the lack of proper sanitization of the 'slug' attribute within the 'wpforo' shortcode to inject SQL code. Successful exploitation could lead to the exposure of sensitive data stored in the WordPress database. The vulnerability was patched in version 2.3.4.",

Although CWE-943 and CWE-74 are more specific, CWE-89 directly addresses the root cause of **SQL Injection**. The evidence clearly points to the construction of an SQL command using externally-influenced input without proper neutralization.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    cwe943[\"CWE-943: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Data Query Logic\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used as an Argument\"]\n    \n    cwe943 -->|CHILDOF| cwe89\n    cwe74 -->|CHILDOF| cwe89\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe89 primary\n    class cwe943,cwe74 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query** (the root cause), which leads to **SQL Injection**. The impact of this is the ability to extract sensitive information from the database.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is strongly based on the evidence provided in the vulnerability description and CVE summary. The key phrases \"insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query\" and \"SQL injection\" clearly indicate CWE-89 as the appropriate classification. The relationship analysis confirms that CWE-89 is a suitable base-level CWE that directly addresses the identified weakness.
