The description provided the following evidence: \"Linksys E5600 v1.1.0.26 was discovered to contain a **command injection** vulnerability in the runtime.ddnsStatus DynDNS function via the username parameter.\" This statement aligns perfectly with the definition of CWE-78, which involves constructing an OS command using externally-influenced input without proper neutralization.\n\nCWE-77 was considered but deemed less specific. Although CWE-77 is a parent of CWE-78, the evidence clearly points to the vulnerability being an OS command injection. The selection of CWE-78 is at the optimal level of specificity because it accurately reflects the nature of the vulnerability based on the provided evidence.",
