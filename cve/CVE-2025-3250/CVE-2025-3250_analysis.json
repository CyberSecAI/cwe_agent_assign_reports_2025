No child or parent relationships impacted this decision, as the description directly matches the base case of deserialization of untrusted data.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe502[\"CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data\"]\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe502 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **deserialization** of untrusted data (CWE-502). The impact of this **deserialization** is not detailed in the provided description, but it could lead to remote code execution or other severe consequences. The description focuses solely on the root cause.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the explicit mention of \"**deserialization**\" in the vulnerability description. The description states: \"The manipulation leads to **deserialization**.\" This directly corresponds to CWE-502 (Deserialization of Untrusted Data). The retriever results also list CWE-502 with a decent score, further supporting this selection. The absence of details about the impact of the **deserialization** limits the mapping to just the root cause.\n\nThe selected CWE (CWE-502) is at the optimal level of specificity because the description doesn't provide information about how the untrusted data is used after deserialization, or any specific type of injection or code execution that results.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or
