## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved scsi qedf Ensure the copied buf is NUL terminated Currently, we allocate a count-sized kernel buffer and copy count from userspace to that buffer. Later, we use kstrtouint on this buffer but we dont ensure that the string is terminated inside the buffer, this can lead to **OOB read** when using kstrtouint. Fix this issue by using memdup_user_nul instead of memdup_user.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `qedf_dbg_debug_cmd_write` function in the `qedf_debugfs.c` file of the Linux kernel's `qedf` (QLogic FastLinQ Ethernet driver) module was using `memdup_user` to copy data from user space into a kernel buffer. This function does not guarantee null termination of the copied data. Subsequently, `kstrtouint` was used on this buffer, which could lead to an out-of-bounds read if the user-provided data was not null-terminated.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Out-of-bounds read:** The core vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read. When `kstrtouint` operates on a non-null-terminated string, it may read beyond the allocated buffer, leading to a kernel crash or other unpredictable behavior.
- **Lack of null termination:** The use of `memdup_user` without subsequent null termination was the direct cause of the issue.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Kernel crash:** The primary impact is a kernel crash due to the out-of-bounds read. This can lead to a denial of service on the affected system.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Debugfs interaction:** An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by writing data to the `debug_cmd` debugfs file. This file is associated with the `qedf` driver.
- **User-controlled input:** The attacker can control the input data being copied by `memdup_user` and subsequently used by `kstrtouint`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Local access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system to be able to interact with the debugfs files and trigger the vulnerability.
- **Ability to write to debugfs:** The attacker needs sufficient privileges to write to the `debug_cmd` file, which is usually only available to root or users with specific access permissions.

**Mitigation:**
- The fix involves replacing the `memdup_user` call with `memdup_user_nul`. This function allocates the buffer and copies the data and ensures the copied buffer is null terminated.

**Summary of changes:**
- The following change was made in `drivers/scsi/qedf/qedf_debugfs.c`:
  ```diff
  --- a/drivers/scsi/qedf/qedf_debugfs.c
  +++ b/drivers/scsi/qedf/qedf_debugfs.c

   	if (!count || *ppos)

  -	kern_buf = memdup_user(buffer, count);
  +	kern_buf = memdup_user_nul(buffer, count);
  	if (IS_ERR(kern_buf))
  		return PTR_ERR(kern_buf);
  ```

This change ensures that the buffer copied from the user space is null-terminated, thereby preventing the out-of-bounds read vulnerability when passed to kstrtouint.
