  "reference_content": "**CVE:** CVE-2025-3164 (PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval)\n\n**RELATION TO CVE:** RELATED\n\n**Vulnerability Details:**\n\n*   **Root cause:** The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper input validation and sanitization of the H2 database connection URL provided by the user. Specifically, the `INIT` parameter within the JDBC URL is not adequately restricted, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands during database initialization.\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n    *   SQL Injection\n    *   Insufficient Input Validation\n*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server by injecting malicious SQL code into the `INIT` parameter of the H2 database connection URL. This could lead to remote code execution, data breaches, or denial of service. The provided PoC demonstrates the ability to create a file on the server (`/tmp/pwneeeee`).\n*   **Attack vectors:**\n    *   The attack vector involves sending a crafted POST request to the `/api/semantic/database/testConnect` endpoint with a malicious H2 database connection URL in the JSON payload.\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n    *   The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint.  Authentication is required (Bearer token), but the example shows a token.\n*   **Mitigation or fix:**\n    1.  **Input Filtering (Allowlist):** Implement a regular expression allowlist to validate the H2 connection URL, ensuring it only contains valid characters and essential parameters. Example regex provided: `^jdbc:h2:mem:[a-zA-Z0-9_]+(;\\\\w+=\\\\w+)*$`\n    2.  **Blacklist Filtering:** Remove or escape dangerous parameters like `INIT`, `RUNSCRIPT`, and `TRACE_LEVEL_SYSTEM_OUT` from the URL using string replacement. Example provided: `String sanitizedUrl = jdbcUrl.replaceAll(\";\\\\s*INIT\\\\s*=\", \";INIT_BLOCKED=\");`\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n*   The vulnerability affects versions of SuperSonic below 0.9.8.\n*   The issue reporter is willing to submit a pull request.\n*   The content provides more detail than a placeholder CVE description would.\n*   The PoC demonstrates a clear path to remote code execution.",

CWE-94, **Code Injection**, is a consequence of successful SQL injection. CWE-89 is a base CWE, providing a good level of detail, and CWE-94 is also a base CWE. The relationship is that successful exploitation of CWE-89 *can precede* CWE-94.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n\n    cwe89 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe89 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe94\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe89 primary\n    class cwe94 secondary\n    class cwe74 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with **improper neutralization** of special elements in the H2 database connection URL, leading to SQL injection (CWE-89). This then results in arbitrary code execution (CWE-94) on the server.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, particularly the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which explicitly states that the vulnerability lies in the lack of proper input validation and sanitization of the H2 database connection URL, leading to SQL injection. The successful SQL injection allows for arbitrary code execution. The relationship graph reinforces this understanding, showing how CWE-89 can precede CWE-94.\n\nThe evidence supporting CWE-89 is:\n*   \"The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper input validation and sanitization of the H2 database connection URL provided by the user.\"\n*   \"Specifically, the `INIT` parameter within the JDBC URL is not adequately restricted, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands during database initialization.\"\nThe evidence supporting CWE-94 is:\n*   \"An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server by injecting malicious SQL code into the `INIT` parameter of the H2 database connection URL.\"\n\nCWE-89 is selected because it precisely describes the root cause of the vulnerability: **improper neutralization** of special elements in an SQL command. CWE-94 is selected because it represents the direct consequence of the successful SQL injection: arbitrary code execution. Both CWEs are at the base level of abstraction, providing sufficient detail.\n\nOther CWEs Considered:\n\n*   CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')): While **improper neutralization** is a factor, this vulnerability doesn't directly involve web page generation or cross-site scripting.\n*   CWE-78 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')): Similar to CWE-79, OS command injection is a consequence of successful exploitation, but not the direct cause.\n*   CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')): This is a higher-level class. SQL Injection (CWE-89) is more specific.\n*   CWE-1336 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine): This is not related to template engine usage.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\nN/A",
