## Vulnerability Description
The KiviCare Clinic & Patient Management System (EHR) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the service_list[0][service_id] parameter of the get_widget_payment_options AJAX action in all versions up to, and including, 3.6.4 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Custom-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**
- **weakness:** **SQL injection**
- **impact:** extract sensitive information from the database
- **attacker:** authenticated attackers
- **product:** KiviCare Clinic & Patient Management System
- **version:** all versions up to 3.6.4
- **component:** service_list[0][service_id] parameter of the get_widget_payment_options AJAX action

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-11729

**Root Cause:** Insufficient escaping of user-supplied input and lack of sufficient preparation in the existing SQL query. Specifically, the `service_list[0][service_id]` parameter of the `get_widget_payment_options` AJAX action is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL code into database queries.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The code fails to properly sanitize the `service_list[0][service_id]` parameter, allowing special characters and SQL syntax to be passed directly to the database.
*   **Insufficient Prepared Statements:** The use of dynamic queries without proper parameterization opens the door for SQL injection attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database by appending malicious SQL queries to existing ones. This could include user data, payment information, or other confidential data.
*   **Potential Data Modification:** Although the provided information only confirms the ability to extract data, SQL injection vulnerabilities can often also lead to data modification or deletion. (not explicit from given content but typical for SQLi).

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The attack occurs over the network, through an AJAX request.
*   **AJAX Action:** The vulnerable parameter resides within the `get_widget_payment_options` AJAX action.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have at least "subscriber" level access to WordPress.
*   **Access to the vulnerable AJAX endpoint:** The attacker needs to be able to send a request to the vulnerable AJAX action with the malicious `service_list[0][service_id]` parameter.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability is present in KiviCare â€“ Clinic & Patient Management System (EHR) plugin versions up to and including 3.6.4.
*   The issue is fixed in version 3.6.5.
*   The vulnerable code is located in the `KCBookAppointmentWidgetController.php` file
* The patch involves sanitizing the `service_list_data` by applying `absint` to ensure that the data are integers before using them in SQL queries, and also checking `payment_mode` before setting status

This information provides more details than the original CVE description, specifically mentioning the vulnerable parameter, the vulnerable AJAX action, and the location of the vulnerable code. It also confirms that this vulnerability allows for data extraction.
