This directly aligns with CWE-327 [CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm], \"Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm,\" as it suggests a non-standard or potentially flawed cryptographic approach. The absence of integrity checks also points to CWE-649 [CWE-649: Reliance on Obfuscation or Encryption of Security-Relevant Inputs without Integrity Checking], \"Reliance on Obfuscation or Encryption of Security-Relevant Inputs without Integrity Checking,\" because without integrity checks, the system relies solely on the encryption which can be bypassed or manipulated if the cryptographic implementation is weak.\n\nI considered other CWEs from the Retriever Results, but they were less directly relevant:\n\n*   CWE-807 [CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision]: While untrusted inputs are always a concern, the primary issue here is the cryptographic implementation itself.\n*   CWE-319 [CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information]: This is not the case since encryption is present, albeit weak.\n*   CWE-321 [CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key]: There's no information about hard-coded keys.\n\nThe selection of CWE-327 [CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm] as the primary CWE is based on the explicit mention of a **custom implementation of encryption**, which implies a deviation from established and vetted cryptographic algorithms. This increases the risk of using a **broken or risky algorithm**.
