## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved rtmutex Drop rt_mutexwait_lock before scheduling rt_mutex_handle_deadlock() is called with rt_mutexwait_lock held. In the good case it returns with the lock held and in the deadlock case it emits a warning and goes into an endless scheduling loop with the lock held, which triggers the scheduling in atomic warning. Unlock rt_mutexwait_lock in the dead lock case before issuing the warning and dropping into the schedule for ever loop. [ tglx Moved unlock before the WARN(), removed the pointless comment, massaged changelog, added Fixes tag ]

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **unlocking rt_mutexwait_lock before scheduling**
- **impact:** scheduling in atomic warning. Unlock rt_mutexwait_lock in the dead lock case before issuing the warning and dropping into the schedule for ever loop
- **product:** Linux kernel

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The `rt_mutex_handle_deadlock` function in the Linux kernel's real-time mutex (rtmutex) implementation was being called while holding the `rt_mutex::wait_lock`. In a deadlock scenario, this function would enter an infinite scheduling loop while still holding the lock, leading to a "scheduling in atomic context" warning and potentially other issues.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Lock Held During Deadlock Handling:** The primary vulnerability is that `rt_mutex_handle_deadlock` does not release the `wait_lock` before entering an infinite loop when a deadlock is detected.
- **Scheduling in Atomic Context:** The code attempts to schedule (via `rt_mutex_schedule()` or `schedule()`) while holding the `wait_lock`, a spinlock, which is not allowed and can cause issues due to the atomic context.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **"Scheduling in atomic context" warning:** The immediate impact is triggering a warning, which indicates a severe kernel bug.
- **Potential System Instability:** Although not directly mentioned as crashing the system, entering an endless loop while holding a spinlock can lead to unpredictable system behavior, including potential deadlocks and instability.
- **Denial of Service:** The infinite loop effectively hangs the task, causing a denial-of-service condition for that task.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Triggering an rtmutex Deadlock:** An attacker would need to cause a deadlock involving rtmutexes. This could potentially be achieved by manipulating thread scheduling or resource locking. The specific conditions required to trigger an rtmutex deadlock are not explicitly outlined, but would likely involve contention and circular dependencies in lock acquisition.
- **Internal Kernel Vulnerability:** This is an internal kernel issue and is not exploitable from user space without a prior vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to induce a deadlock:** The attacker must be able to create a situation where threads contend for rtmutex resources, resulting in a deadlock. This often requires specific kernel interaction or system load.
- **Kernel Access (Indirectly):** This vulnerability is primarily located in kernel code and will need an attacker to be able to call kernel code in a specific way or through an exploit to trigger the deadlock. User space itself cannot trigger the bug as it's an issue with how kernel locks are used.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix involves releasing the `wait_lock` *before* entering the infinite scheduling loop in the `rt_mutex_handle_deadlock` function.
- The code change is relatively small, indicating that the fix primarily addresses the incorrect locking behavior rather than a complex logic flaw.
- The provided commit messages indicate that the fix has been backported to various stable branches.

In summary, this is a vulnerability where incorrect lock handling during deadlock detection led to a "scheduling in atomic context" issue and potential instability. The fix is a straightforward unlock before entering the scheduling loop.
