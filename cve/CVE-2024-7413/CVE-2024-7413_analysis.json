  "description": "The Obfuscate Email plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Full Path Disclosure in all versions up to, and including, 3.8.1. This is due to the plugin allowing direct access to the bootstrap.php file which has **display_errors on**. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve the full path of the web application, which can be used to aid other attacks. The information displayed is not useful on its own, and requires another vulnerability to be present for damage to an affected website.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n- The vulnerability stems from the `Obfuscate Email` plugin for WordPress exposing its `bootstrap.php` file directly. This file has `display_errors` enabled.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n- **Full Path Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of the full server path of the web application via the `bootstrap.php` file, due to `display_errors` being enabled.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Information Leakage:** An attacker can retrieve the full server path of the WordPress installation. This information is considered sensitive.\n- **Aid to Other Attacks:** While the path information itself is not directly damaging, it can be used by attackers to aid in further attacks. An attacker would need to identify another vulnerability to fully compromise the application.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Direct Access:** The vulnerability is triggered through direct access to the `bootstrap.php` file via a web request.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker doesn't need any authentication to exploit the vulnerability.\n- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the web server hosting the vulnerable WordPress site.",

CWE-200 is a broader class that encompasses the exposure of sensitive information, but CWE-209 is more specific to the vulnerability described.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe209[\"CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe1295[\"CWE-1295: Debug Messages Revealing Unnecessary Information\"]\n\n    cwe209 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe1295 -->|PEEROF| cwe209\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe209 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n    class cwe1295 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the plugin having `display_errors` enabled, leading to the exposure of the full path, which is then exposed to unauthenticated users.\n\n`display_errors on` -> CWE-209 -> Exposure of Full Path\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability is a Full Path Disclosure due to the plugin's `bootstrap.php` file having `display_errors` enabled, which reveals the web application's full path. The primary weakness is the **generation of an error message containing sensitive information** (CWE-209). This is triggered by direct access to the `bootstrap.php` file.\n\nThe **rootcause** is `display_errors on`, causing the **weakness**, which is **full path disclosure**. The retriever results also highlight relevant CWEs such as CWE-201 \"Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\", and CWE-209 \"Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information\".\n\nCWE-200 \"Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\" is a broader category, but the specific mechanism is the generation of an error message. While CWE-200 could apply, CWE-209 is more precise. The evidence clearly points to the error message as the source of the sensitive information.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as
