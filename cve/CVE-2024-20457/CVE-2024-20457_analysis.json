  "description": "A vulnerability in the logging component of Cisco Unified Communications Manager IM &amp Presence Service (Unified CM IM&ampP) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to view sensitive information in clear text on an affected system. This vulnerability is due to the **storage of unencrypted credentials in certain logs**. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing the logs on an affected system and obtaining credentials that they may not normally have access to. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access sensitive information from the device.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2024-20457:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n- The vulnerability is due to the storage of unencrypted credentials within certain logs of the Cisco Unified Communications Manager IM & Presence Service (Unified CM IM&P) when running the External Database Merge Tool.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive information, specifically credentials, are stored in clear text in logs, which should be encrypted.\n- **Lack of Encryption:** The failure to encrypt stored credentials represents a significant weakness in the system's security.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Information:** A successful exploit could allow an attacker to access and view credentials that they would not normally have access to.\n- **Potential for Further Compromise:** The leaked credentials could be used for further malicious activities and/or access to other systems.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Remote Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.\n- **Log Access:** An attacker needs to gain access to the affected system's logs.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Authentication:** The attacker must be an authenticated user on the affected system, which means that they must have valid credentials to access the system, though not necessarily the credentials stored in the logs.\n- **Log Access:** The attacker needs to be able to access the log files where the credentials are stored.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n- **Affected Products:** The vulnerability affects Cisco Unified CM IM&P when it runs the External Database Merge Tool.\n- **No Workarounds:**  There are no workarounds available to mitigate this vulnerability.\n- **Fixed Releases:** The vulnerability is addressed in specific releases of the affected software, including:\n  - 12.5(1)SU9 for 12.5(1) and earlier versions\n  - 14SU5 for version 14\n  - 15SU2 for version 15\n\nThe vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 6.5 (Medium), with a vector string of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N",
