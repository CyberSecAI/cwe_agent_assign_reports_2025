  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-55953:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from insufficient filtering of parameters when constructing JDBC connection strings in DataEase. Specifically, the application fails to properly sanitize the `host` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject malicious parameters. This enables them to bypass intended restrictions and execute arbitrary actions.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Inadequate Input Validation:** The primary weakness is the lack of robust input validation for the `host` parameter in the JDBC connection string. The application attempts to filter \"illegal parameters\" but does not apply this filtering correctly to the complete JDBC URL, leaving it vulnerable to parameter injection.\n*   **Deserialization Vulnerability:** The injected parameters, such as `autoDeserialize=true` can trigger deserialization of arbitrary data, potentially leading to remote code execution.\n*   **Arbitrary File Read:** By using the `allowLoadLocalInfile` parameter combined with a crafted username containing the path of a file to read, an attacker can force the application to read arbitrary files from the server.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Arbitrary File Read:** An authenticated attacker can read sensitive files from the server, such as `/etc/passwd`, exposing potentially confidential data.\n*   **Remote Code Execution:** By exploiting the deserialization vulnerability, an attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on the server. The provided content specifically demonstrates file reading, however, the underlying deserialization issue implies the possibility of RCE\n*   **Data Breach:** Successful exploitation could lead to data breaches by compromising system files and potentially other internal data through crafted queries.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Malicious JDBC URL Construction:** The attacker crafts a malicious JDBC connection URL by injecting harmful parameters into the `host` parameter during the datasource configuration.\n*   **HTTP POST Request:** The crafted configuration is sent via an HTTP POST request to the `/datasource/validate/` endpoint.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the DataEase application to exploit this vulnerability.\n*   **Knowledge of JDBC Parameters:** The attacker needs to know about specific MySQL JDBC connection parameters (e.g., `autoDeserialize`, `allowLoadLocalInfile`, `user`) that can be used to perform arbitrary file read or potentially achieve remote code execution.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n*   The vulnerability exists in the `MysqlConfiguration` class within the `io.dataease.dto.datasource` package.\n*   The code snippet provided shows how the `getJdbc()` method constructs the JDBC URL without properly validating the host parameters.\n*   The attacker bypasses the illegal parameter check by encoding the malicious parameters into the host parameter, which is not directly checked against the `illegalParameters` list.\n*   The fix includes adding a check to the constructed JDBC URL, not just `extraParams`.\n\n**Affected Versions:**\n\n*   Versions <= 1.18.26 are affected.\n\n**Patched Versions:**\n\n*   Version 1.18.27 and later contain the fix.",

This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n*   **CWE-20: Improper Input Validation**\n    *   **Technical Explanation:** This is a general class of weakness where the software does not validate input sufficiently. The CVE summary mentions \"Inadequate Input Validation\".\n    *   **Security Implications:** This can lead to a wide range of vulnerabilities, including command injection, denial of service, and information disclosure.\n    *   **Relationships:** CWE-20 is a high-level class, and more specific CWEs like CWE-88 are often more appropriate when the exact nature of the input validation failure is known.\n    *   **Secondary Weakness:** This is a contributing factor as the rootcause is the lack of parameter filtering.\n\n### Explanation of Other CWEs Considered:\n\n*   **CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')** - While injection is a factor, CWE-88 is more specific to the argument injection within a command.\n*   **CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements** - This is a class-level CWE, and CWE-88 is a more specific base CWE.\n*   **CWE-790: Improper Filtering of Special Elements** - While filtering is mentioned, CWE-88 is more specific to the argument injection.\n*   **CWE-1336: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine** - This is not related to the vulnerability description.\n*   **CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File, CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere, CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information, CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory, CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer, CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere, CWE-252: Unchecked Return Value, CWE-204: Observable Response Discrepancy, CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm, CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output, CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value, CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity, CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling, CWE-69: Improper Handling of Windows ::DATA Alternate Data Stream, CWE-1325: Improperly Controlled Sequential Memory Allocation, CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data, CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse, CWE-756: Missing Custom Error Page, CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input** - These are less relevant because they do not directly address the **lack of filtering** in the construction of the JDBC connection string.",
