# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-25090

## Description

Insufficient input validation and sanitation in Profile name & screenname, Bookmark name & description and blogroll name features in all versions of Apache Roller on all platforms allows an authenticated user to perform an **XSS** attack. Mitigation if you do not have Roller configured for untrusted users, then you need to do nothing because you trust your users to author raw HTML and other web content. If you are running with untrusted users then you should upgrade to Roller 6.1.3. This issue affects Apache Roller from 5.0.0 before 6.1.3. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 6.1.3, which fixes the issue.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Rootcause:** insufficient input validation
- **Weakness:** ['XSS', 'cross-site scripting']
- **Vector:** raw HTML and other web content
- **Attacker:** authenticated user
- **Product:** Apache Roller
- **Version:** 5.0.0 to 6.1.2
- **Component:** ['Profile name & screenname', 'Bookmark name & description and blogroll name features']

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID  | CWE Name                                                                    | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
| :-------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------- | :---------------------- | :------------------------------ | :------------------------------ |
| CWE-79 | Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') | 1.0 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-20 | Improper Input Validation | 0.7 | Class | Secondary | Allowed-with-Review |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is CWE-79, which is caused by **insufficient input validation**. CWE-79 is a Base level CWE. CWE-20 is a Class level CWE and a parent of many input validation related CWEs, including those that could lead to XSS.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain begins with **insufficient input validation** (CWE-20). This leads to **improper neutralization of input** and ultimately results in Cross-Site Scripting (CWE-79).

## Summary of Analysis
The vulnerability is an **XSS** vulnerability due to **insufficient input validation**.

The primary CWE is CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')). The vulnerability description explicitly states that **insufficient input validation** in multiple features of Apache Roller allows an authenticated user to perform an **XSS** attack. This aligns directly with the description of CWE-79, which involves the product not neutralizing or incorrectly neutralizing user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page served to other users.

CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) is included as a secondary CWE because the root cause identified is **insufficient input validation**. While the primary impact is XSS, the underlying cause is a failure to properly validate and sanitize input, which is what CWE-20 addresses.

Other CWEs were considered but deemed less appropriate:

*   CWE-1333 (Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity): While this CWE appears in the retrieved results, there is no indication in the vulnerability description that inefficient regular expressions are involved.
*   CWE-347 (Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature): There is no mention of cryptographic signatures in the vulnerability description.
*   CWE-116 (Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output): While encoding and escaping are related to neutralization, the primary issue described is the **lack of input validation**, making CWE-79 a more direct fit.
*   CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization): The vulnerability description does not suggest any authorization issues, but rather focuses on input validation.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-79 is a Base level CWE that directly addresses the XSS vulnerability, while CWE-20 highlights the underlying input validation issue.
