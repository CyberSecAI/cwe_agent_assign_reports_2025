# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-29120

## Vulnerability Description
In Streampark (version < 2.1.4), when a user logged in successfully, the Backend service would return Authorization as the front-end authentication credential. User can use this credential to request other users information, including the administrators username, password, salt value, etc. Mitigation all users should upgrade to 2.1.4

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **improper authentication**
- **impact:** information disclosure
- **attacker:** authenticated user
- **product:** Streampark
- **version:** < 2.1.4
- **component:** Backend service

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-29120:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is that after a successful login, the Apache StreamPark backend service returns the "Authorization" header as the authentication credential to the frontend. This credential is not scoped to the logged-in user and can be used to access other users' information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Leakage:** The primary vulnerability is information leakage. The exposed "Authorization" credential allows an authenticated user to potentially access sensitive data of other users.
- **Insecure Credential Handling:** The application improperly handles authentication credentials by exposing them in the response and not associating them uniquely to the logged-in user session.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can use the leaked credential to access information of other users.
- **Credential Theft:** The attacker can potentially steal sensitive information, such as the administrator's username, password, and salt value, by making requests with the leaked credential.
- **Potential for Privilege Escalation:** By compromising an administrator account through credential theft, an attacker could gain full control over the StreamPark application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the application's HTTP API. A successfully logged-in user can capture the "Authorization" header, and then reuse it to make unauthorized API requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a valid user of the Apache StreamPark application and successfully authenticate at least once to obtain the leaky Authorization header.
- No special privileges or system access is required beyond being a valid user.

**Additional Notes:**

- This content provides more detail than a typical CVE description. It specifies that the leaked information includes username, password, and salt values, which is quite sensitive.
- The vulnerability is present in all versions prior to 2.1.4.
- The vulnerability has a **"Severity: important"** tag.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control

**Authentication**:
Determines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.

* Example phrases: "user must log in", "lack of login check", "bypasses login"
* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.

  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* – used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).

**Authorization**:
Determines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do. It decides access *after* identity is verified.

* Example phrases: "unauthorized access", "regular user can access admin panel", "role checks are missing"
* CWE relevance: use CWEs like 862, 863, 285 for authorization errors:

  * **CWE-862**: *Missing Authorization* – the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all.
  * **CWE-863**: *Incorrect Authorization* – the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).
  * **CWE-285**: *Improper Authorization* – general category for any flawed authorization logic or design.

**Access Control**:
A broader term that includes both authentication and authorization. Governs how resources are protected and who can access them under what conditions.

* CWE relevance:

  * **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* – top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear.
  * This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.

## Mapping Discussion – Common Misclassification Patterns

### 1. **CWE-306 vs CWE-862**:

* **306** is about lack of **authentication** (e.g., *no login required at all*).
* **862** is about lack of **authorization** *after* authentication (e.g., *admin check missing*).
* ✅ Example CWE-306: *“An unauthenticated attacker can invoke the password reset API.”*
* ✅ Example CWE-862: *“An authenticated user without admin privileges can delete any user account.”*

### 2. **CWE-285 vs CWE-284**:

* **285** is specific to authorization flaws – it's a better choice than 284 **if** the issue involves *improper or missing role checks*.
* **284** should be reserved for general access control issues when it’s unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.

---

## Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification

**Phrase like "unauthorized access" is not enough.**

* If you **cannot determine whether identity was checked**, assume it’s **authorization** and consider 862 or 863.
* If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** → CWE-306.
* If the **access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced**, but it's not due to missing checks, consider **CWE-284**.

---

## Good Mapping Examples

* ✅ **CWE-306**: “The endpoint `/admin/deleteUser` does not require any authentication.”
* ✅ **CWE-862**: “Any logged-in user can change any other user's email without being an admin.”
* ✅ **CWE-863**: “An admin check exists but incorrectly grants access to non-admin users.”
* ✅ **CWE-285**: “Application uses a static role check that fails when roles change dynamically.”
* ✅ **CWE-284**: “Inconsistent enforcement of access rules across services with unclear policy source.”

| Role check is present but flawed                           | CWE-863        |
| General or ambiguous authorization failure                 | CWE-285        |
