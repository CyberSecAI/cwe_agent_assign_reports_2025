# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-39486
## Query
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drm/drm_file Fix pid refcounting race , Maxime Ripard , Thomas Zimmermann filp->pid is supposed to be a refcounted pointer however, before this patch, drm_file_update_pid() only increments the refcount of a struct pid after storing a pointer to it in filp->pid and dropping the dev->filelist_mutex, making the following race possible process A process B ========= ========= begin drm_file_update_pid mutex_lock(&dev->filelist_mutex) rcu_replace_pointer(filp->pid, , 1) mutex_unlock(&dev->filelist_mutex) begin drm_file_update_pid mutex_lock(&dev->filelist_mutex) rcu_replace_pointer(filp->pid, , 1) mutex_unlock(&dev->filelist_mutex) get_pid() synchronize_rcu() put_pid() *** pid B reaches refcount 0 and is freed here *** get_pid() *** UAF *** synchronize_rcu() put_pid() As far as I know, this race can only occur with CONFIG_PREEMPT_RCU=y because it requires RCU to detect a quiescent state in code that is not explicitly calling into the scheduler. This race leads to use-after-free of a struct pid. It is probably somewhat hard to hit because process A has to pass through a synchronize_rcu() oper

- **rootcause**: 'race condition in drm_file_update_pid()'
