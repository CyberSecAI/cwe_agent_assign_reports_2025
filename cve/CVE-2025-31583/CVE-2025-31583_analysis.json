The secondary weakness, CWE-79, Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting'), results from the CSRF vulnerability, where the lack of CSRF protection enables stored XSS. CWE-79 is a base-level CWE, providing a specific description of the XSS vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe116[\"CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\"]\n\n    cwe79 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe116\n    cwe352 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe79\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe352 primary\n    class cwe79 secondary\n    class cwe116 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of CSRF protection** (CWE-352), which then allows for Stored **XSS** (CWE-79).\n\nCWE-352 (Root Cause) -> CWE-79 (Impact)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is strongly based on the provided evidence, specifically the vulnerability description key phrases and the CVE reference links content summary. The key phrases highlight the **lack of CSRF protection** and the resulting **XSS** vulnerability. The CVE reference confirms the Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) as the root cause.\n\nThe selection of CWE-352 and CWE-79 is justified because they accurately represent the root cause and impact of the vulnerability, respectively. Both are at appropriate levels of specificity (Compound for CWE-352, Base for CWE-79).\n\nCWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output was considered, as XSS often involves improper output encoding.
