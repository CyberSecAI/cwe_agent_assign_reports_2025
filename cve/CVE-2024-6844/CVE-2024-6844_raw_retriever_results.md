# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-6844
## Query
A vulnerability in corydolphin/flask-cors version 4.0.1 allows for inconsistent CORS matching due to the handling of the + character in URL paths. The request.path is passed through the unquote_plus function, which converts the + character to a space . This behavior leads to incorrect path normalization, causing potential mismatches in CORS configuration. As a result, endpoints may not be matched correctly to their CORS settings, leading to unexpected CORS policy application. This can cause unauthorized cross-origin access or block valid requests, creating security vulnerabilities and usability issues.

## Keyphrases
- **weakness**: 'inconsistent CORS matching'
