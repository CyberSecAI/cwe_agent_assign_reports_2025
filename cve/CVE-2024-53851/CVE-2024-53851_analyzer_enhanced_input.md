## Vulnerability Description
Discourse is an open source platform for community discussion. In affected versions the endpoint for generating inline oneboxes for URLs wasnt enforcing limits on the number of URLs that it accepted, allowing a malicious user to inflict denial of service on some parts of the app. This vulnerability is only exploitable by authenticated users. This issue has been patched in the latest stable, beta and tests-passed versions of Discourse. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should turn off the `enable inline onebox on all domains` site setting and remove all entries from the `allowed inline onebox domains` site setting.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2024-53851 based on provided content

The provided content is **RELEVANT** to CVE-2024-53851. It details a partial denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability in Discourse. Here's a breakdown of the information extracted:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The endpoint for generating inline oneboxes for URLs did not enforce limits on the number of URLs accepted, allowing a malicious user to inflict a denial of service.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Uncontrolled resource consumption (specifically, the number of URLs processed for inline oneboxes).
*   Lack of input validation/limiting on the `/inline-onebox` endpoint.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Denial of service on parts of the application.

**Attack vectors:**

*   An authenticated user can send a request to the `/inline-onebox` endpoint with a large number of URLs (more than 10).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker must be an authenticated user of the Discourse application.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   **Patches:** The issue is patched in Discourse versions stable >= 3.3.3, beta >= 3.4.0.beta4, and tests-passed >= 3.4.0.beta4.
*   **Workarounds:**
    *   Disable the `enable inline onebox on all domains` site setting.
    *   Remove all entries from the `allowed inline onebox domains` site setting.
*   The commit `416ec83` limits the `/inline-onebox` endpoint to 10 URLs at a time.

**CVSS Score:**

*   CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L (Overall score: 4.3/10 - Moderate)
