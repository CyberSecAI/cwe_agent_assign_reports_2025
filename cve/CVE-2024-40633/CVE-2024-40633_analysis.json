  "description": "Sylius is an Open Source eCommerce Framework on Symfony. A security vulnerability was discovered in the `/api/v2/shop/adjustments/{id}` endpoint, which retrieves order adjustments based on incremental integer IDs. The vulnerability allows an attacker to enumerate valid adjustment IDs and retrieve order tokens. Using these tokens, an attacker can access guest customer order details - sensitive guest customer information. The issue is fixed in versions 1.12.19, 1.13.4 and above. The `/api/v2/shop/adjustments/{id}` will always return `404` status. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may alter their config to mitigate this issue. Please see the linked GHSA for details.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n\n*   The `/api/v2/shop/adjustments/{id}` endpoint in Sylius allows retrieval of order adjustments using an incremental integer ID. This makes it possible for attackers to guess valid IDs.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Information Disclosure:** The endpoint discloses sensitive information, specifically order tokens, associated with adjustments.\n*   **Predictable IDs:** The use of incremental integer IDs allows for easy enumeration of valid adjustment IDs.\n*  **Lack of proper access control:** The endpoint doesn't restrict access based on user roles.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Access to Guest Customer Order Details:** By obtaining order tokens, an attacker can access the details of guest customer orders, which can contain sensitive personal information.\n*   **Enumeration of valid IDs:** The attacker is able to enumerate all valid adjustments and the related order tokens.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Direct API Request:** Attacker sends GET requests to `/api/v2/shop/adjustments/{id}` with incrementing integer values as the `id`.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the application's API endpoint.\n*   **No authentication needed:** The attacker doesn't need any authentication to exploit the vulnerability.\n\n**Additional Notes**\n\n* The advisory includes suggested workarounds that can be used if upgrading to the patched version isn't immediately possible.\n* The advisory mentions that the fix is to ensure the endpoint always returns a 404 status, preventing access to any adjustment data.\n* This is a High severity issue due to the sensitive information that could be exposed.\n* The provided CWE is CWE-200 which is information disclosure.",

While CWE-200 is generally discouraged, the available evidence does not support a more specific child CWE. The vulnerability chain also played a role, as the **missing authentication** (CWE-306) led to the **exposure of sensitive information** (CWE-200). CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key) is also considered since the incremental ID can be viewed as a user-controlled key.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n\n    cwe306 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe200\n    cwe639 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe200\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe306,cwe639 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authentication** and/or **authorization bypass** on the `/api/v2/shop/adjustments/{id}` endpoint. Because of the endpoint's design, it is possible to enumerate valid adjustment IDs and retrieve order tokens. This leads directly to the **exposure of sensitive guest customer order details**, resulting in the impact.\n\n*   **Root Cause:** Missing Authentication (CWE-306) and/or Authorization Bypass (CWE-639)\n*   **Weakness:** Exposure of Sensitive Information (CWE-200)\n*   **Impact:** Access to Guest Customer Order Details\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nMy analysis is primarily based on the provided evidence, including the vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary. The key phrases highlight the **impact** of accessing guest customer order details and the **vector** of incremental integer IDs. The content summary clearly states the **information disclosure** weakness due to the lack of proper access control.\n\nThe initial assessment leaned towards CWE-200 as the primary weakness due to the explicit mention of information disclosure and the high retriever score. However, the retriever results also suggested CWE-306 and CWE-639 as potential candidates related to the **missing authentication** and **authorization bypass**, respectively.\n\nThe final decision involves mapping CWE-200 as the primary weakness, acknowledging that while it is a Class-level CWE and generally discouraged, the provided evidence does not strongly support a more specific Base-level CWE. CWE-306 and CWE-639 are added as secondary CWEs due to the lack of authentication and/or authorization checks on the vulnerable endpoint, which directly contributed to the information exposure. This combination provides a more complete picture of the vulnerability.
