# Analysis Report for CVE-2024-9486

# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-9486

## Description

A security issue was discovered in the Kubernetes Image Builder versions <= v0.1.37 where **default credentials are enabled** during the image build process. Virtual machine images built using the Proxmox provider do not disable these default credentials, and nodes using the resulting images may be accessible via these default credentials. The credentials can be used to gain root access. Kubernetes clusters are only affected if their nodes use VM images created via the Image Builder project with its Proxmox provider.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Rootcause:** default credentials are enabled
- **Impact:** gain root access
- **Product:** Kubernetes Image Builder
- **Version:** <= v0.1.37

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-1392 | Use of Default Credentials | 1.0 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | 0.7 | Base | Secondary Candidate | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that influenced my decision was the hierarchical relationship between CWE-1391 (Use of Weak Credentials) and CWE-1392 (Use of Default Credentials), with CWE-1392 being a more specific child of CWE-1391. The relationship between CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) and CWE-1392 indicates that the use of default credentials essentially bypasses the need for authentication, making both CWEs potentially relevant.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **default credentials being enabled** in the built images (CWE-1392). This **weakness** leads to a bypass of authentication (CWE-306) and ultimately allows an attacker to gain root access to the affected VMs.
  - **Root Cause:** CWE-1392: Use of Default Credentials
  - **Impact:** Gain root access

## Summary of Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-1392, Use of Default Credentials, because the **rootcause** is that "**default credentials are enabled** during the image build process." The Image Builder project with its Proxmox provider creates VM images that do not disable these default credentials. The evidence is clear and directly supports this mapping, aligning with MITRE's guidance for selecting Base-level CWEs when possible.

CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) was considered as a secondary CWE because the presence of default credentials effectively negates the need for authentication. However, it's not the primary **rootcause**, but rather a consequence of using default credentials. The vulnerability description clearly highlights the failure to disable default credentials as the core issue.

I am confident in the assessment because of the clear description of the **rootcause** in the "Vulnerability Description Key Phrases" section, as well as the detailed breakdown in the "CVE Reference Links Content Summary."
