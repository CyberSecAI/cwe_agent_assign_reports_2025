  "description": "A security issue was discovered in the Kubernetes Image Builder versions <= v0.1.37 where **default credentials are enabled** during the image build process. Virtual machine images built using the Proxmox provider do not disable these default credentials, and nodes using the resulting images may be accessible via these default credentials. The credentials can be used to gain root access. Kubernetes clusters are only affected if their nodes use VM images created via the Image Builder project with its Proxmox provider.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2024-9486:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\nThe root cause is the failure to disable or remove default credentials for the `builder` account in VM images built using the Kubernetes Image Builder with the Proxmox provider. During the image build process, default credentials were set but not properly removed at the end.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Default Credentials:** The `builder` account in the generated VM images retains default credentials.\n*   **Lack of Cleanup:** The image build process does not properly disable or remove the `builder` account or its credentials after image creation.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the affected virtual machines via SSH using the default `builder` credentials.\n*   **Root Access:** The default credentials provide root access to the compromised VMs.\n*   **Full System Compromise:** With root access, an attacker can fully compromise the affected nodes and potentially the entire cluster.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Network Access:** An attacker can exploit the vulnerability via network access, using SSH, to connect to the VMs using the known default credentials.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Network Reachability:** The attacker must have network access to the affected virtual machines.\n*   **Knowledge of Default Credentials:** The attacker needs to know or guess the default credentials for the 'builder' account\n\n**Additional details:**\n\n*   The vulnerability is specific to VM images built with the Proxmox provider using Kubernetes Image Builder versions <= v0.1.37.\n*   The fix involves setting a randomly-generated password for the `builder` account during the build process, and then disabling the account after the build completes.\n*   The fix was implemented in Image Builder master and released in v0.1.38.\n*   The vulnerability is considered critical with a CVSS score of 9.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n*   A temporary mitigation before upgrading is to disable the `builder` account using `usermod -L builder` on affected VMs.\n*   The command `last builder` can be used to identify if the vulnerable `builder` account was used for logins.",

The relationship between CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) and CWE-1392 indicates that the use of default credentials essentially bypasses the need for authentication, making both CWEs potentially relevant.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1392[\"CWE-1392: Use of Default Credentials\"]\n    cwe1391[\"CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n\n    cwe1392 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1391\n    cwe1392 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe306\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1392 primary\n    class cwe1391,cwe306 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **default credentials being enabled** in the built images (CWE-1392). This **weakness** leads to a bypass of authentication (CWE-306) and ultimately allows an attacker to gain root access to the affected VMs.\n  - **Root Cause:** CWE-1392: Use of Default Credentials\n  - **Impact:** Gain root access\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-1392, Use of Default Credentials, because the **rootcause** is that \"**default credentials are enabled** during the image build process.\" The Image Builder project with its Proxmox provider creates VM images that do not disable these default credentials. The evidence is clear and directly supports this mapping, aligning with MITRE's guidance for selecting Base-level CWEs when possible.\n\nCWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) was considered as a secondary CWE because the presence of default credentials effectively negates the need for authentication. However, it's not the primary **rootcause**, but rather a consequence of using default credentials. The vulnerability description clearly highlights the failure to disable default credentials as the core issue.\n\nI am confident in the assessment because of the clear description of the **rootcause** in the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section, as well as the detailed breakdown in the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary.\"\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25
