The **race condition** between threads is the root cause. |\n| CWE-404 | Improper Resource Shutdown or Release | 0.6 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary Candidate. The main thread releasing a completion object while the asynchronous thread is still using it relates to improper resource shutdown. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.75\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship that influenced the decision was the parent-child relationship between CWE-362 and its potential base-level children. While the description pointed to a **race condition**, there wasn't sufficient detail to pinpoint a more specific variant. The potential for improper resource shutdown due to the race condition led to considering CWE-404 as a secondary candidate.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    cwe404[\"CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\"]\n    cwe667[\"CWE-667: Improper Locking\"]\n    \n    cwe404 -- CANFOLLOW --> cwe362\n    cwe362 -->|PEEROF| cwe667\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe362 primary\n    class cwe404 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **race condition** between the main thread and an asynchronous thread (CWE-362). This leads to the main thread potentially releasing a completion object (resource) prematurely (CWE-404), while the asynchronous thread is still using it. This results in a page fault and kernel panic.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-362, which accurately describes the **race condition** at the heart of the vulnerability. The description explicitly mentions this **race condition** between the main thread and asynchronous thread. \"If the main thread detects that the task has timed out, the asynchronous thread will panic when executing the completion notification because the main thread completion object has been released.\" This also suggests that the main thread is releasing the completion object while the async thread is still operating on it. CWE-404 is considered as a secondary candidate as it represents the improper resource shutdown aspect of the vulnerability.\n\nThe Retriever Results also support the choice of CWE-362, as it is the top combined result.\n\nThe decision to select CWE-362 and CWE-404 is based on the evidence provided in the vulnerability description and supported by the Retriever Results and CWE specifications. These CWEs are at an appropriate level of specificity, given the available information.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check.
