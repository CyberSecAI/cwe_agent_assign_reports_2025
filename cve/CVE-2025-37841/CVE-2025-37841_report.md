# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2025-37841

## Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved pm cpupower bench Prevent **NULL dereference** on malloc failure If malloc returns NULL due to low memory, config pointer can be NULL. Add a check to prevent **NULL dereference**.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Weakness:** NULL dereference
- **Product:** Linux kernel
- **Component:** pm cpupower bench

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary

| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-476 | NULL Pointer Dereference | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions a **NULL dereference**. |
| CWE-252 | Unchecked Return Value | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The **NULL dereference** occurs because the return value of `malloc` is not checked. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is CWE-476, which results from a **NULL** pointer dereference. This can be caused by CWE-252, the lack of checking the return value of malloc.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the `malloc` function returning **NULL**. This is followed by **missing** check on the return value (CWE-252), which leads to a **NULL pointer dereference** (CWE-476).

## Summary of Analysis
The vulnerability description clearly states that the issue is a **NULL dereference** that happens when `malloc` fails and returns **NULL**, and this return value is not checked before using the pointer. The primary CWE is CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference). The secondary CWE is CWE-252 (Unchecked Return Value). The assessment is based on the vulnerability description, and retriever results.

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product dereferences a pointer that it expects to be valid but is NULL.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

This CWE is selected since the vulnerability involves a **NULL** pointer dereference.

## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

This CWE is not selected as the pointer is not uninitialized. It is assigned **NULL** due to `malloc` failure.

## CWE-252: Unchecked Return Value
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not check the return value from a method or function, which can prevent it from detecting unexpected states and conditions.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

This CWE is selected since the return value of `malloc` is not checked, leading to potential **NULL dereference**.

## CWE-822: Untrusted Pointer Dereference
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product obtains a value from an untrusted source, converts this value to a pointer, and dereferences the resulting pointer.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

This CWE is not selected as the pointer is not from an untrusted source.

## CWE-909: Missing Initialization of Resource
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not initialize a critical resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

This CWE is not selected, the resource is initialized (to **NULL**) due to `malloc` failure.

## CWE-667: Improper Locking
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

This CWE is not selected since this is not related to locking.

## CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions
**Abstraction Level**: Pillar
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly anticipate or handle exceptional conditions that rarely occur during normal operation of the product.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.

This CWE is not selected as it is too general.

## CWE-170: Improper Null Termination
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not terminate or incorrectly terminates a string or array with a null character or equivalent terminator.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

This CWE is not selected as it is not related to **NULL** termination.

## CWE-665: Improper Initialization
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not initialize or incorrectly initializes a resource, which might leave the resource in an unexpected state when it is accessed or used.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate

This CWE is not selected as the pointer is initialized to **NULL** due to `malloc` failure.

## CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not check or incorrectly checks for unusual or exceptional conditions that are not expected to occur frequently during day to day operation of the product.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

This CWE is not selected since CWE-252 is more specific.

## CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 451.27
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product dereferences a pointer that it expects to be valid but is NULL.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

This CWE is selected since the vulnerability involves a **NULL** pointer dereference.

## CWE-252: Unchecked Return Value
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 433.60
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product does not check the return value from a method or function, which can prevent it from detecting unexpected states and conditions.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

This CWE is selected since the return value of `malloc` is not checked, leading to potential **NULL dereference**.

## CWE-690: Unchecked Return Value to NULL Pointer Dereference
**Abstraction Level**: Compound
**Similarity Score**: 425.29
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product does not check for an
