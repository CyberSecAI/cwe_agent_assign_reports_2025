This is followed by **missing** check on the return value (CWE-252), which leads to a **NULL pointer dereference** (CWE-476).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that the issue is a **NULL dereference** that happens when `malloc` fails and returns **NULL**, and this return value is not checked before using the pointer. The primary CWE is CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference). The secondary CWE is CWE-252 (Unchecked Return Value). The assessment is based on the vulnerability description, and retriever results.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product dereferences a pointer that it expects to be valid but is NULL.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nThis CWE is selected since the vulnerability involves a **NULL** pointer dereference.\n\n## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nThis CWE is not selected as the pointer is not uninitialized.
