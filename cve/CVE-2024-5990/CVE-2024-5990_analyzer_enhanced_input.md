## Vulnerability Description
Due to an **improper input validation**, an unauthenticated threat actor can send a malicious message to a monitor thread within Rockwell Automation ThinServerTM and cause a denial-of-service condition on the affected device.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **improper input validation**
- **impact:** denial-of-service
- **vector:** malicious message
- **attacker:** unauthenticated threat actor
- **product:** Rockwell Automation ThinServerTM
- **component:** monitor thread

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown for CVE-2024-5990:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Improper input validation within the ThinManager® ThinServer™ software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper input validation which allows malicious messages to be processed by the ThinServer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated attacker can send a malicious message to a monitor thread, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition on the affected device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based (AV:N). An attacker can send a malicious message to the ThinServer over the network to trigger the vulnerability.
- The attack does not require any special privileges (PR:N) or user interaction (UI:N).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network messages to the ThinManager ThinServer.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.

**Additional Notes:**
- The advisory also lists the affected software versions and the corrected versions.
- Mitigations include updating to corrected software versions, limiting remote access to TCP port 2031, and implementing security best practices.
