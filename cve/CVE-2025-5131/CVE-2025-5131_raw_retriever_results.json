  "query": "A vulnerability was found in Tmall Demo up to 20250505. It has been declared as critical. This vulnerability affects the function uploadCategoryImage of the file tmall/admin/uploadCategoryImage. The manipulation of the argument File leads to unrestricted upload. The attack can be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. Continious delivery with rolling releases is used by this product. Therefore, no version details of affected nor updated releases are available. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",
