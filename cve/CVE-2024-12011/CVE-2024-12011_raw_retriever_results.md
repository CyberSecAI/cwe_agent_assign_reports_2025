# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-12011
## Query
A CWE-126 Buffer Over-read was discovered affecting the 130.8005 TCP/IP Gateway running firmware version 12h. The information disclosure can be triggered by leveraging a memory leak affecting the web server. A remote unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability in order to leak valid authentication tokens from the process memory associated to users currently logged to the system and bypass the authentication mechanism.

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: 'CWE-126 Buffer Over-read'
- **weakness**: 'memory leak'
