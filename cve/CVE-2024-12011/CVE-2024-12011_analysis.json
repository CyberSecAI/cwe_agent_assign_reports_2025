The secondary weakness, CWE-126, is a direct consequence of the **memory leak**, allowing an attacker to read beyond buffer boundaries. CWE-200, Exposure of Sensitive Information, is a potential impact, given that authentication tokens are exposed.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe401[\"CWE-401: Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime\"]\n    cwe126[\"CWE-126: Buffer Over-read\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe126 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe401\n    cwe200 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe126\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe401 primary\n    class cwe126 secondary\n    class cwe200 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **CWE-401 (Missing Release of Memory)**, leading to a **memory leak**. This **memory leak** causes **CWE-126 (Buffer Over-read)**, allowing the attacker to read sensitive information (authentication tokens), which results in **CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information)** and ultimately bypasses authentication.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified **CWE-126 Buffer Over-read** as the root cause based on the vulnerability description. However, after further analysis of the CVE Reference Links Content Summary and Retriever Results, it became evident that the **memory leak** is the underlying issue, thus **CWE-401** is the more appropriate primary CWE. The **buffer over-read** is a consequence of the **memory leak**, enabling the **exposure of sensitive information**. The selection of CWE-401 as the primary CWE and CWE-126 as a secondary CWE is based on the evidence provided and the understanding of the vulnerability chain. The evidence is quite strong, as the vulnerability description explicitly mentions both the **buffer over-read** and the **memory leak**. The graph relationships support this chain, with **CWE-401** leading to **CWE-126**, which in turn leads to **CWE-200**.
