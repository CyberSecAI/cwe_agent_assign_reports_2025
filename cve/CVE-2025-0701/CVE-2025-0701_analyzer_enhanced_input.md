## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
CVE-2025-0701: PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval

The provided content is **RELATED** to a potential SQL injection vulnerability. Here's the extracted information:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `queryListByPage` method in `src/main/java/io/github/service/impl/SysUserServiceImpl.java` does not filter the `sort` parameter, leading to a potential SQL injection.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection
*   **Impact of exploitation:**  The impact is not explicitly stated, but SQL injection can lead to data breaches, data manipulation, and potentially system compromise.
*   **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the `sort` parameter in the URL: `http://192.168.0.105:8080/admin/sys/user/list?sort=username%20asc,extractvalue(1,concat(0x5c,user(),0x5c))&order=&offset=0&limit=20`
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to craft and send malicious HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.  Network access to the application is required.
*   **Mitigation or fix:** The content does not provide a specific fix, but it implies that proper input validation and sanitization of the `sort` parameter are necessary to prevent the injection.

**Note:** This content provides more detail than a placeholder CVE description would typically contain, as it identifies the specific method and file involved, and provides a sample exploit URL.
