## Vulnerability Description
Zulip server provides an open-source team chat that helps teams stay productive and focused. Zulip Server 7.0 and above are vulnerable to an information disclose attack, where, if a Zulip server is hosting multiple organizations, an unauthenticated user can make a request and determine if an email address is in use by a user. Zulip Server 9.4 resolves the issue, as does the `main` branch of Zulip Server. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **version:** 7.0 and above

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2024-56136 based on provided content

The provided content is **RELEVANT** to CVE-2024-56136. It details a vulnerability in Zulip Server versions >= 7.0, patched in version 9.4, and provides details about the root cause, impact, and mitigation.

Here's an extraction of the relevant information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability leaks information by returning an "invalid subdomain" error when an attempt is made to log in to `user@example.com` on a subdomain X when `user@example.com` does not exist on X, but *does* exist on another subdomain Y.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Information disclosure. The server reveals whether an email address is associated with an account on a different subdomain.

**Impact of exploitation:**

An unauthenticated user can determine if an email address is in use by a user within the Zulip server, even if they attempt to log in to the wrong subdomain.

**Attack vectors:**

*   Network-based attack. An attacker can send requests over the network to determine email address existence.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   Unauthenticated. No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   Upgrade to Zulip Server version 9.4 or later.
*   The `main` branch of Zulip Server also contains the fix.
*   The fix removes the "invalid subdomain" error message and instead returns a generic authentication error ("Your username or password is incorrect").

**CVSS Score:**

*   6.9 (Moderate)

**CVSS v4 Metrics:**

*   Attack Vector: Network
*   Attack Complexity: Low
*   Attack Requirements: None
*   Privileges Required: None
*   User Interaction: None
*   Confidentiality: Low
*   Integrity: None
*   Availability: None

**Additional Details (more detail than official CVE description):**

*   The commit message (c6334a7) and associated code changes (in `test_auth_backends.py` and `auth.py`) are provided, demonstrating the fix and related tests.
*   The content explicitly states that the `invalid_subdomain` error was intended for server logs only and should not be exposed to end-users.
*   The content provides a detailed explanation of the CVSS v4 metrics.
