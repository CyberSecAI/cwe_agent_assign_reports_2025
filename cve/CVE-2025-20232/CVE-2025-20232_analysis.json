This occurs on the \u201c/app/search/search\u201c endpoint through its \u201cs\u201c parameter.\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Risky command safeguards bypass.\n*   **Impact of exploitation:** A low-privileged user can run a saved search with a risky command using the permissions of a higher-privileged user to bypass the SPL safeguards for risky commands on the \u201c/app/search/search\u201c endpoint. The content does not specify the consequences of exploiting the vulnerability.\n*   **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to phish the victim by tricking them into initiating a request within their browser.\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A low-privileged user without \u201cadmin\u201c or \u201cpower\u201c Splunk roles. The attacker needs to phish the victim.\n*   **Mitigation or fix:** Upgrade Splunk Enterprise to versions 9.4.0, 9.3.3, 9.2.5, 9.1.8, or higher. Splunk is actively monitoring and patching Splunk Cloud Platform instances.\n*   **More Detail than CVE Description:** Yes, the content provides more details by specifying the affected endpoint and parameter (\"s\" parameter) and describes the attack vector.",

The analysis also considered chain relationships, particularly how improper authorization can lead to the execution of risky commands. Abstraction levels were crucial in selecting the most appropriate level of detail for the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe267[\"CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe942[\"CWE-942: Permissive Cross-domain Policy with Untrusted Domains\"]\n\n    cwe942 -->|CHILDOF| cwe863\n    cwe942 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe267 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **Incorrect Authorization** (CWE-863), where a low-privileged user is not correctly authorized to execute certain commands with elevated privileges. This leads to the **bypass of SPL safeguards for risky commands**, effectively allowing the unauthorized execution. This can also involve **Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions** (CWE-267) if the risky commands are associated with privileges that should not be accessible to the low-privileged user.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary assessment is based on the provided evidence, which clearly indicates an authorization issue. The key phrase \"bypass the SPL safeguards for risky commands using the permissions of a higher-privileged user\" directly supports the selection of **CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization**, as it highlights a failure in the authorization mechanism that allows a low-privileged user to perform actions they should not be permitted to do.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the selection by highlighting the connections between authorization flaws and potential consequences. The chosen CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately represent the root cause of the vulnerability (incorrect authorization) and a contributing factor (unsafe actions associated with privileges).\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
