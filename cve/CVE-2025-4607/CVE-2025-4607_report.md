# Analysis Report for CVE-2025-4607

# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2025-4607

## Description

The PSW Front-end Login & Registration plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation in all versions up to, and including, 1.12 via the customer_registration() function. This is due to the use of a weak, low-entropy OTP mechanism in the forget() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to initiate a password reset for any user, including administrators, and elevate their privileges for full site takeover.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Rootcause:** weak OTP mechanism
- **Impact:** Privilege Escalation
- **Attacker:** unauthenticated attackers
- **Product:** PSW Front-end Login & Registration plugin for WordPress
- **Version:** all versions up to and including 1.12
- **Component:** customer_registration() function

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-620 | Unverified Password Change | 0.9 | Base | Primary CWE | Allowed |
| CWE-266 | Incorrect Privilege Assignment | 0.7 | Base | Secondary Candidate | Allowed |
| CWE-306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | 0.6 | Base | Secondary Candidate | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is the unverified password change (CWE-620). This can lead to an incorrect privilege assignment (CWE-266) since an attacker can reset a user's password, including an administrator, and gain their privileges. CWE-306, Missing Authentication for Critical Function, is relevant as the password reset process lacks proper authentication.

## Vulnerability Chain
1.  **Root Cause:** **Weak OTP mechanism** in the forget() function which leads to **CWE-620**: Unverified Password Change.
2.  **Impact:** This allows unauthenticated attackers to initiate a password reset for any user.
3.  **Result:** The attacker can then escalate their privileges, leading to **CWE-266**: Incorrect Privilege Assignment and full site takeover.
4.  The password reset function having **missing authentication** may lead to **CWE-306**: Missing Authentication for Critical Function.

## Summary of Analysis
The vulnerability description clearly states a **weak OTP mechanism** as the root cause, directly enabling unauthenticated privilege escalation. The primary weakness is identified as CWE-620, Unverified Password Change. This is supported by the description mentioning the ability to initiate password resets without proper verification. The unverified password change directly leads to the ability to escalate privileges (CWE-266). The lack of proper authentication on the password reset function may be classified as CWE-306.

*   The assessment is based on the provided evidence: "This is due to the use of a **weak**, low-entropy OTP mechanism in the forget() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to initiate a password reset for any user, including administrators, and elevate their privileges for full site takeover."
*   The graph relationships influenced the selection by highlighting the connection between the unverified password change and the resulting privilege escalation.
*   CWE-620, CWE-266, and CWE-306 are at the optimal level of specificity, providing a clear understanding of the vulnerability's root cause and potential impact.

**Description**:
A product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.
