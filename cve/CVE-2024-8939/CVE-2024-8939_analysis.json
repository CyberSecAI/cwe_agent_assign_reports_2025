  "description": "A vulnerability was found in the ilab model serve component, where improper handling of the best_of parameter in the vllm JSON web API can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS). The API used for LLM-based sentence or chat completion accepts a best_of parameter to return the best completion from several options. When this parameter is set to a large value, the API does not handle timeouts or resource exhaustion properly, allowing an attacker to cause a DoS by consuming excessive system resources. This leads to the API becoming unresponsive, preventing legitimate users from accessing the service.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-8939:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\n*   The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of the `best_of` parameter in the vllm JSON web API. This API is used for interacting with Large Language Models (LLMs) for sentence or chat completion.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Improper Timeout Handling:** The API does not handle timeouts or resource exhaustion correctly when the `best_of` parameter is set to a large value.\n*   **Resource Exhaustion:**  Setting a large `best_of` value can cause excessive processing time and consume excessive system resources.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause a DoS by sending requests with a large `best_of` value, leading to the API becoming unresponsive and preventing legitimate users from accessing the service.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   The attack vector is through the vllm JSON web API. An attacker sends a malicious request containing a large value for the `best_of` parameter.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vllm JSON web API. The bug report specifies that the issue primarily affects instances where the API is exposed beyond localhost.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n*   The API is part of the ilab model serve component, which wraps the vllm API.\n*   The `best_of` parameter is used to request the best completion from several options.\n\nThe provided information gives a good understanding of the vulnerability, going into more detail than the placeholder CVE description.",

CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) is a class-level CWE and a parent of CWE-770, making it a less specific choice. The relationship is a simple parent-child where CWE-770 is a more specific instance of CWE-400.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    \n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe770 primary\n    class cwe400 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper handling of the best_of parameter**, which leads to allocation of resources without limits or throttling (CWE-770), and eventually results in a Denial of Service (DoS).\n- Root Cause: **Improper Handling of best_of parameter**\n- Weakness: CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\n- Impact: Denial of Service (DoS)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-770 as the primary cause, stemming from the **improper handling of the best_of parameter** that leads to uncontrolled resource allocation. The evidence supporting this includes the vulnerability description highlighting the lack of timeouts or resource exhaustion handling when a large value is provided for the `best_of` parameter, and the resulting Denial of Service (DoS).\n\nThe retriever results also suggested CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption). However, CWE-770 is a more specific base-level CWE, making it a better fit than the class-level CWE-400.\n\nThe final decision is based on the evidence of **improper resource handling** without limits, directly leading to the DoS. CWE-770 accurately captures this weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1286: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input that is expected to be well-formed - i.e., to comply with a certain syntax - but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input complies with the syntax.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-193: Off-by-one Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product calculates or uses an incorrect maximum or minimum value that is 1 more, or 1 less, than the correct value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nAn algorithm in a product has an inefficient worst-case computational complexity that may be detrimental to system performance and can be triggered by an attacker, typically using crafted manipulations that ensure that the worst case is being reached.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.67\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.67\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
