# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-5716

## Vulnerability Description
Logsign Unified SecOps Platform Authentication Bypass Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to bypass authentication on affected installations of Logsign Unified SecOps Platform. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the password reset mechanism. The issue results from the **lack of restriction of excessive authentication attempts**. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to reset a users password and bypass authentication on the system. Was ZDI-CAN-24164.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **lack of restriction of excessive authentication attempts**
- **impact:** bypass authentication
- **attacker:** remote attackers
- **product:** Logsign Unified SecOps Platform
- **component:** password reset mechanism

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of restriction on excessive authentication attempts within the password reset mechanism of Logsign Unified SecOps Platform.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Authentication bypass due to the ability to reset a user's password without proper restrictions.
    - Lack of rate limiting or other mechanisms to prevent abuse of the password reset functionality.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can reset any user's password, thereby gaining unauthorized access to the system.
    - Confidentiality: High (access to sensitive data within the platform)
    - Integrity: Low (potential to modify data)
    - Availability: Low (potential to disrupt system)
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks, specifically through the password reset functionality.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the Logsign Unified SecOps Platform. No prior authentication or special privileges are required.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control

**Authentication**:
Determines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.

* Example phrases: "user must log in", "lack of login check", "bypasses login"
* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.

  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* – used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).

**Authorization**:
Determines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do. It decides access *after* identity is verified.

* Example phrases: "unauthorized access", "regular user can access admin panel", "role checks are missing"
* CWE relevance: use CWEs like 862, 863, 285 for authorization errors:

  * **CWE-862**: *Missing Authorization* – the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all.
  * **CWE-863**: *Incorrect Authorization* – the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).
  * **CWE-285**: *Improper Authorization* – general category for any flawed authorization logic or design.

**Access Control**:
A broader term that includes both authentication and authorization. Governs how resources are protected and who can access them under what conditions.

* CWE relevance:

  * **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* – top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear.
  * This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.

## Mapping Discussion – Common Misclassification Patterns

### 1. **CWE-306 vs CWE-862**:

* **306** is about lack of **authentication** (e.g., *no login required at all*).
* **862** is about lack of **authorization** *after* authentication (e.g., *admin check missing*).
* ✅ Example CWE-306: *“An unauthenticated attacker can invoke the password reset API.”*
* ✅ Example CWE-862: *“An authenticated user without admin privileges can delete any user account.”*

### 2. **CWE-285 vs CWE-284**:

* **285** is specific to authorization flaws – it's a better choice than 284 **if** the issue involves *improper or missing role checks*.
* **284** should be reserved for general access control issues when it’s unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.

## Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification

**Phrase like "unauthorized access" is not enough.**

* If you **cannot determine whether identity was checked**, assume it’s **authorization** and consider 862 or 863.
* If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** → CWE-306.
* If the **access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced**, but it's not due to missing checks, consider **CWE-284**.

---

## Good Mapping Examples

* ✅ **CWE-306**: “The endpoint `/admin/deleteUser` does not require any authentication.”
* ✅ **CWE-862**: “Any logged-in user can change any other user's email without being an admin.”
* ✅ **CWE-863**: “An admin check exists but incorrectly grants access to non-admin users.”
* ✅ **CWE-285**: “Application uses a static role check that fails when roles change dynamically.”
* ✅ **CWE-284**: “Inconsistent enforcement of access rules across services with unclear policy source.”

| **Indicator**                                              | **Likely CWE** |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |

| Role check is present but flawed                           | CWE-863        |
| General or ambiguous authorization failure                 | CWE-285        |
| High-level access control problem with no clear root cause | CWE-284        |
