This can lead to a wide range of problems, including information exposures, denial of service, and arbitrary code execution.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-24730: Go-based continuous deployment product does not check that a user has certain privileges to update or create an app, allowing adversaries to read sensitive repository information\n\n- CVE-2009-3168: Web application does not restrict access to admin scripts, allowing authenticated users to reset administrative passwords.\n\n- CVE-2009-2960: Web application does not restrict access to admin scripts, allowing authenticated users to modify passwords of other users.\n\n- CVE-2009-3597: Web application stores database file under the web root with insufficient access control (CWE-219), allowing direct request.\n\n- CVE-2009-2282: Terminal server does not check authorization for guest access.\n\n- CVE-2009-3230: Database server does not use appropriate privileges for certain sensitive operations.\n\n- CVE-2009-2213: Gateway uses default \"Allow\" configuration for its authorization settings.\n\n- CVE-2009-0034: Chain: product does not properly interpret a configuration option for a system group, allowing users to gain privileges.\n\n- CVE-2008-6123: Chain: SNMP product does not properly parse a configuration option for which hosts are allowed to connect, allowing unauthorized IP addresses to connect.\n\n- CVE-2008-5027: System monitoring software allows users to bypass authorization by creating custom forms.\n\n- CVE-2008-7109: Chain: reliance on client-side security (CWE-602) allows attackers to bypass authorization using a custom client.\n\n- CVE-2008-3424: Chain: product does not properly handle wildcards in an authorization policy list, allowing unintended access.\n\n- CVE-2009-3781: Content management system does not check access permissions for private files, allowing others to view those files.\n\n- CVE-2008-4577: ACL-based protection mechanism treats negative access rights as if they are positive, allowing bypass of intended restrictions.\n\n- CVE-2008-6548: Product does not check the ACL of a page accessed using an \"include\" directive, allowing attackers to read unauthorized files.\n\n- CVE-2007-2925: Default ACL list for a DNS server does not set certain ACLs, allowing unauthorized DNS queries.\n\n- CVE-2006-6679: Product relies on the X-Forwarded-For HTTP header for authorization, allowing unintended access by spoofing the header.\n\n- CVE-2005-3623: OS kernel does not check for a certain privilege before setting ACLs for files.\n\n- CVE-2005-2801: Chain: file-system code performs an incorrect comparison (CWE-697), preventing default ACLs from being properly applied.\n\n- CVE-2001-1155: Chain: product does not properly check the result of a reverse DNS lookup because of operator precedence (CWE-783), allowing bypass of DNS-based access restrictions.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-24583: The Timetable and Event Schedule WordPress plugin before 2.4.2 does not have proper access control when deleting a timeslot, allowing any user with the edit_posts capability (contributor+) to delete arbitrary timeslot from any events. Furthermore, no CSRF check is in place as well, allowing such attack to be performed via CSRF against a logged in with such capability\n\n- CVE-2020-10697: A flaw was found in Ansible Tower when running Openshift. Tower runs a memcached, which is accessed via TCP. An attacker can take advantage of writing a playbook polluting this cache, causing a denial of service attack. This attack would not completely stop the service, but in the worst-case scenario, it can reduce the Tower performance, for which memcached is designed. Theoretically, more sophisticated attacks can be performed by manipulating and crafting the cache, as Tower relies on memcached as a place to pull out setting values. Confidential and sensitive data stored in memcached should not be pulled, as this information is encrypted. This flaw affects Ansible Tower versions before 3.6.4, Ansible Tower versions before 3.5.6 and Ansible Tower versions before 3.4.6.\n\n- CVE-2021-1839: The issue was addressed with improved permissions logic.

Due to a bug in ASF code `POST /Api/ASF` ASF API endpoint responsible for updating global ASF config incorrectly removed `IPCPassword` from the resulting config when the caller did not specify it explicitly. Due to the above, it was possible for the user to accidentally remove `IPCPassword` security measure from his IPC interface when updating global ASF config, which exists as part of global config update functionality in ASF-ui. Removal of `IPCPassword` possesses a security risk, as unauthorized users may in result access the IPC interface after such modification. The issue is patched in ASF V5.1.2.4 and future versions. We recommend to manually verify that `IPCPassword` is specified after update, and if not, set it accordingly. In default settings, ASF is configured to allow IPC access from `localhost` only and should not affect majority of users.\n\n- CVE-2021-3282: HashiCorp Vault Enterprise 1.6.0 & 1.6.1 allowed the `remove-peer` raft operator command to be executed against DR secondaries without authentication. Fixed in 1.6.2.\n\n- CVE-2021-34675: Basix NEX-Forms through 7.8.7 allows authentication bypass for stored PDF reports.\n\n- CVE-2021-34676: Basix NEX-Forms through 7.8.7 allows authentication bypass for Excel report generation.\n\n- CVE-2021-35941: Western Digital WD My Book Live (2.x and later) and WD My Book Live Duo (all versions) have an administrator API that can perform a system factory restore without authentication, as exploited in the wild in June 2021, a different vulnerability than CVE-2018-18472.\n\n- CVE-2021-37415: Zoho ManageEngine ServiceDesk Plus before 11302 is vulnerable to authentication bypass that allows a few REST-API URLs without authentication.\n\n- CVE-2021-37420: Zoho ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus before 6112 is vulnerable to mail spoofing.\n\n- CVE-2021-37624: FreeSWITCH is a Software Defined Telecom Stack enabling the digital transformation from proprietary telecom switches to a software implementation that runs on any commodity hardware. Prior to version 1.10.7, FreeSWITCH does not authenticate SIP MESSAGE requests, leading to spam and message spoofing. By default, SIP requests of the type MESSAGE (RFC 3428) are not authenticated in the affected versions of FreeSWITCH. MESSAGE requests are relayed to SIP user agents registered with the FreeSWITCH server without requiring any authentication. Although this behaviour can be changed by setting the `auth-messages` parameter to `true`, it is not the default setting. Abuse of this security issue allows attackers to send SIP MESSAGE messages to any SIP user agent that is registered with the server without requiring authentication. Additionally, since no authentication is required, chat messages can be spoofed to appear to come from trusted entities. Therefore, abuse can lead to spam and enable social engineering, phishing and similar attacks. This issue is patched in version 1.10.7. Maintainers recommend that this SIP message type is authenticated by default so that FreeSWITCH administrators do not need to be explicitly set the `auth-messages` parameter. When following such a recommendation, a new parameter can be introduced to explicitly disable authentication.\n\n- CVE-2021-38412: Properly formatted POST requests to multiple resources on the HTTP and HTTPS web servers of the Digi PortServer TS 16 Rack device do not require authentication or authentication tokens. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to enable the SNMP service and manipulate the community strings to achieve further control in.\n\n- CVE-2021-41157: FreeSWITCH is a Software Defined Telecom Stack enabling the digital transformation from proprietary telecom switches to a software implementation that runs on any commodity hardware. By default, SIP requests of the type SUBSCRIBE are not authenticated in the affected versions of FreeSWITCH. Abuse of this security issue allows attackers to subscribe to user agent event notifications without the need to authenticate. This abuse poses privacy concerns and might lead to social engineering or similar attacks. For example, attackers may be able to monitor the status of target SIP extensions. Although this issue was fixed in version v1.10.6, installations upgraded to the fixed version of FreeSWITCH from an older version, may still be vulnerable if the configuration is not updated accordingly. Software upgrades do not update the configuration by default. SIP SUBSCRIBE messages should be authenticated by default so that FreeSWITCH administrators do not need to explicitly set the `auth-subscriptions` parameter. When following such a recommendation, a new parameter can be introduced to explicitly disable authentication.\n\n- CVE-2020-25566: In SapphireIMS 5.0, it is possible to take over an account by sending a request to the Save_Password form as shown in POC. Notice that we do not require a JSESSIONID in this request and can reset any user\u2019s password by changing the username to that user and password to base64(desired password).\n\n- CVE-2021-30167: The manage users profile services of the network camera device allows an authenticated.

The current security vulnerability allows access to keys and buckets through a curl command or an unauthenticated HTTP request. This enables unauthorized access to buckets and keys thereby exposing data to anonymous clients or users. This affected Apache Ozone prior to the 1.1.0 release.\n\n- CVE-2020-4669: IBM Planning Analytics Local 2.0 connects to a MongoDB server. MongoDB, a document-oriented database system, is listening on the remote port, and it is configured to allow connections without password authentication. A remote attacker can gain unauthorized access to the database. IBM X-Force ID: 184600.\n\n- CVE-2021-33924: Confluent Ansible (cp-ansible) version 5.5.0, 5.5.1, 5.5.2 and 6.0.0 is vulnerable to Incorrect Access Control via its auxiliary component that allows remote attackers to access sensitive information.\n\n- CVE-2021-35936: If remote logging is not used, the worker (in the case of CeleryExecutor) or the scheduler (in the case of LocalExecutor) runs a Flask logging server and is listening on a specific port and also binds on 0.0.0.0 by default.

A malicious user can modify the contents of a `confirmation_token` input during the two-factor authentication process to reference a cache value not associated with the login attempt. In rare cases this can allow a malicious actor to authenticate as a random user in the Panel. The malicious user must target an account with two-factor authentication enabled, and then must provide a correct two-factor authentication token before being authenticated as that user. Due to a validation flaw in the logic handling user authentication during the two-factor authentication process a malicious user can trick the system into loading credentials for an arbitrary user by modifying the token sent to the server. This authentication flaw is present in the `LoginCheckpointController@__invoke` method which handles two-factor authentication for a user. This controller looks for a request input parameter called `confirmation_token` which is expected to be a 64 character random alpha-numeric string that references a value within the Panel's cache containing a `user_id` value. This value is then used to fetch the user that attempted to login, and lookup their two-factor authentication token. Due to the design of this system, any element in the cache that contains only digits could be referenced by a malicious user, and whatever value is stored at that position would be used as the `user_id`. There are a few different areas of the Panel that store values into the cache that are integers, and a user who determines what those cache keys are could pass one of those keys which would cause this code pathway to reference an arbitrary user. At its heart this is a high-risk login bypass vulnerability. However, there are a few additional conditions that must be met in order for this to be successfully executed, notably: 1.) The account referenced by the malicious cache key must have two-factor authentication enabled. An account without two-factor authentication would cause an exception to be triggered by the authentication logic, thusly exiting this authentication flow. 2.) Even if the malicious user is able to reference a valid cache key that references a valid user account with two-factor authentication, they must provide a valid two-factor authentication token. However, due to the design of this endpoint once a valid user account is found with two-factor authentication enabled there is no rate-limiting present, thusly allowing an attacker to brute force combinations until successful. This leads to a third condition that must be met: 3.) For the duration of this attack sequence the cache key being referenced must continue to exist with a valid `user_id` value. Depending on the specific key being used for this attack, this value may disappear quickly, or be changed by other random user interactions on the Panel, outside the control of the attacker. In order to mitigate this vulnerability the underlying authentication logic was changed to use an encrypted session store that the user is therefore unable to control the value of. This completely removed the use of a user-controlled value being used. In addition, the code was audited to ensure this type of vulnerability is not present elsewhere.\n\n- CVE-2021-42338: 4MOSAn GCB Doctor\u2019s login page has improper validation of Cookie, which allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to bypass authentication by code injection in cookie, and arbitrarily manipulate the system or interrupt services by upload and execution of arbitrary files.\n\n- CVE-2021-1541: Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business 220 Series Smart Switches could allow an attacker to do the following: Hijack a user session Execute arbitrary commands as a root user on the underlying operating system Conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack Conduct an HTML injection attack For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2021-41317: XSS Hunter Express before 2021-09-17 does not properly enforce authentication requirements for paths.\n\n- CVE-2021-29012: DMA Softlab Radius Manager 4.4.0 assigns the same session cookie to every admin session.

In Envoy version 1.17.0 an attacker can bypass authentication by presenting a JWT token with an issuer that is not in the provider list when Envoy's JWT Authentication filter is configured with the `allow_missing` requirement under `requires_any` due to a mistake in implementation. Envoy's JWT Authentication filter can be configured with the `allow_missing` requirement that will be satisfied if JWT is missing (JwtMissed error) and fail if JWT is presented or invalid. Due to a mistake in implementation, a JwtUnknownIssuer error was mistakenly converted to JwtMissed when `requires_any` was configured. So if `allow_missing` was configured under `requires_any`, an attacker can bypass authentication by presenting a JWT token with an issuer that is not in the provider list. Integrity may be impacted depending on configuration if the JWT token is used to protect against writes or modifications. This regression was introduced on 2020/11/12 in PR 13839 which fixed handling `allow_missing` under RequiresAny in a JwtRequirement (see issue 13458). The AnyVerifier aggregates the children verifiers' results into a final status where JwtMissing is the default error. However, a JwtUnknownIssuer was mistakenly treated the same as a JwtMissing error and the resulting final aggregation was the default JwtMissing. As a result, `allow_missing` would allow a JWT token with an unknown issuer status. This is fixed in version 1.17.1 by PR 15194. The fix works by preferring JwtUnknownIssuer over a JwtMissing error, fixing the accidental conversion and bypass with `allow_missing`. A user could detect whether a bypass occurred if they have Envoy logs enabled with debug verbosity. Users can enable component level debug logs for JWT. The JWT filter logs will indicate that there is a request with a JWT token and a failure that the JWT token is missing.\n\n- CVE-2021-21513: Dell EMC OpenManage Server Administrator (OMSA) version 9.5 Microsoft Windows installations with Distributed Web Server (DWS) enabled configuration contains an authentication bypass vulnerability.

The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality and integrity.\n\n- CVE-2021-41638: The authentication checks of the MELAG FTP Server in version 2.2.0.4 are incomplete, which allows a remote attacker to access local files only by using a valid username.\n\n- CVE-2022-0910: A downgrade from two-factor authentication to one-factor authentication vulnerability in the CGI program of Zyxel USG/ZyWALL series firmware versions 4.32 through 4.71, USG FLEX series firmware versions 4.50 through 5.21, ATP series firmware versions 4.32 through 5.21, and VPN series firmware versions 4.32 through 5.21, that could allow an authenticated attacker to bypass the second authentication phase to connect the IPsec VPN server even though the two-factor authentication (2FA) was enabled.\n\n- CVE-2022-1049: A flaw was found in the Pacemaker configuration tool (pcs). The pcs daemon was allowing expired accounts, and accounts with expired passwords to login when using PAM authentication. Therefore, unprivileged expired accounts that have been denied access could still login.\n\n- CVE-2022-1426: An issue has been discovered in GitLab affecting all versions starting from 12.6 before 14.8.6, all versions starting from 14.9 before 14.9.4, all versions starting from 14.10 before 14.10.1. GitLab was not correctly authenticating a user that had some certain amount of information which allowed an user to authenticate without a personal access token.\n\n- CVE-2022-1955: Session 1.13.0 allows an attacker with physical access to the victim's device to bypass the application's password/pin lock to access user data. This is possible due to lack of adequate security controls to prevent dynamic code manipulation.\n\n- CVE-2022-20662: A vulnerability in the smart card login authentication of Cisco Duo for macOS could allow an unauthenticated attacker with physical access to bypass authentication. This vulnerability exists because the assigned user of a smart card is not properly matched with the authenticating user. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by configuring a smart card login to bypass Duo authentication. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to use any personal identity verification (PIV) smart card for authentication, even if the smart card is not assigned to the authenticating user.\n\n- CVE-2022-22956: VMware Workspace ONE Access has two authentication bypass vulnerabilities (CVE-2022-22955 & CVE-2022-22956) in the OAuth2 ACS framework. A malicious actor may bypass the authentication mechanism and execute any operation due to exposed endpoints in the authentication framework.\n\n- CVE-2022-23501: TYPO3 is an open source PHP based web content management system. In versions prior to 8.7.49, 9.5.38, 10.4.33, 11.5.20, and 12.1.1 TYPO3 is vulnerable to Improper Authentication. Restricting frontend login to specific users, organized in different storage folders (partitions), can be bypassed. A potential attacker might use this ambiguity in usernames to get access to a different account - however, credentials must be known to the adversary. This issue is patched in versions 8.7.49 ELTS, 9.5.38 ELTS, 10.4.33, 11.5.20, 12.1.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-23600: fleet is an open source device management, built on osquery. Versions prior to 4.9.1 expose a limited ability to spoof SAML authentication with missing audience verification. This impacts deployments using SAML SSO in two specific cases: 1. A malicious or compromised Service Provider (SP) could reuse the SAML response to log into Fleet as a user -- only if the user has an account with the same email in Fleet, _and_ the user signs into the malicious SP via SAML SSO from the same Identity Provider (IdP) configured with Fleet. 2. A user with an account in Fleet could reuse a SAML response intended for another SP to log into Fleet. This is only a concern if the user is blocked from Fleet in the IdP, but continues to have an account in Fleet. If the user is blocked from the IdP entirely, this cannot be exploited. Fleet 4.9.1 resolves this issue. Users unable to upgrade should: Reduce the length of sessions on your IdP to reduce the window for malicious re-use, Limit the amount of SAML Service Providers/Applications used by user accounts with access to Fleet, and When removing access to Fleet in the IdP, delete the Fleet user from Fleet as well.\n\n- CVE-2022-24259: An incorrect check in the component cdr.php of Voipmonitor GUI before v24.96 allows unauthenticated attackers to escalate privileges via a crafted request.\n\n- CVE-2022-24883: FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). Prior to version 2.7.0, server side authentication against a `SAM` file might be successful for invalid credentials if the server has configured an invalid `SAM` file path. FreeRDP based clients are not affected. RDP server implementations using FreeRDP to authenticate against a `SAM` file are affected. Version 2.7.0 contains a fix for this issue. As a workaround, use custom authentication via `HashCallback` and/or ensure the `SAM` database path configured is valid and the application has file handles left.\n\n- CVE-2022-24885: Nextcloud Android app is the Android client for Nextcloud, a self-hosted productivity platform. Prior to version 3.19.1, users can bypass a lock on the Nextcloud app on an Android device by repeatedly reopening the app. Version 3.19.1 contains a fix for the problem. There are currently no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-24976: Atheme IRC Services before 7.2.12, when used in conjunction with InspIRCd, allows authentication bypass by ending an IRC handshake at a certain point during a challenge-response login sequence.\n\n- CVE-2022-2533: An issue has been discovered in GitLab affecting all versions starting from 12.10 before 15.1.6, all versions starting from 15.2 before 15.2.4, all versions starting from 15.3 before 15.3.2.

As a result, nodes that do not have the correct authentication key are not prevented from communicating with other nodes in the cluster.\n\n- CVE-2022-2572: In affected versions of Octopus Server where access is managed by an external authentication provider, it was possible that the API key/keys of a disabled/deleted user were still valid after the access was revoked.\n\n- CVE-2022-26504: Improper authentication in Veeam Backup & Replication 9.5U3, 9.5U4,10.x and 11.x component used for Microsoft System Center Virtual Machine Manager (SCVMM) allows attackers execute arbitrary code via Veeam.Backup.PSManager.exe\n\n- CVE-2022-26562: An issue in provider/libserver/ECKrbAuth.cpp of Kopano Core <= v11.0.2.51 contains an issue which allows attackers to authenticate even if the user account or password is expired. It also exists in the predecessor Zarafa Collaboration Platform (ZCP) in provider/libserver/ECPamAuth.cpp of Zarafa >= 6.30 (introduced between 6.30.0 RC1e and 6.30.8 final).\n\n- CVE-2022-3477: The tagDiv Composer WordPress plugin before 3.5, required by the Newspaper WordPress theme before 12.1 and Newsmag WordPress theme before 5.2.2, does not properly implement the Facebook login feature, allowing unauthenticated attackers to login as any user by just knowing their email address\n\n- CVE-2022-36106: TYPO3 is an open source PHP based web content management system released under the GNU GPL. It has been discovered that the expiration time of a password reset link for TYPO3 backend users has never been evaluated. As a result, a password reset link could be used to perform a password reset even if the default expiry time of two hours has been exceeded. Update to TYPO3 version 10.4.32 or 11.5.16 that fix the problem. There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-36412: In Zoho ManageEngine SupportCenter Plus before 11023, V3 API requests are vulnerable to authentication bypass. (An API request may, in effect, be executed with the credentials of a user who authenticated in the past.)\n\n- CVE-2022-39238: Arvados is an open source platform for managing and analyzing biomedical big data. In versions prior to 2.4.3, when using Portable Authentication Modules (PAM) for user authentication, if a user presented valid credentials but the account is disabled or otherwise not allowed to access the host (such as an expired password), it would still be accepted for access to Arvados. Other authentication methods (LDAP, OpenID Connect) supported by Arvados are not affected by this flaw. This issue is patched in version 2.4.3. Workaround for this issue is to migrate to a different authentication method supported by Arvados, such as LDAP.\n\n- CVE-2022-39263: `@next-auth/upstash-redis-adapter` is the Upstash Redis adapter for NextAuth.js, which provides authentication for Next.js. Applications that use `next-auth` Email Provider and `@next-auth/upstash-redis-adapter` before v3.0.2 are affected by this vulnerability. The Upstash Redis adapter implementation did not check for both the identifier (email) and the token, but only checking for the identifier when verifying the token in the email callback flow. An attacker who knows about the victim's email could easily sign in as the victim, given the attacker also knows about the verification token's expired duration. The vulnerability is patched in v3.0.2. A workaround is available. Using Advanced Initialization, developers can check the requests and compare the query's token and identifier before proceeding.\n\n- CVE-2022-39355: Discourse Patreon enables syncronization between Discourse Groups and Patreon rewards. On sites with Patreon login enabled, an improper authentication vulnerability could be used to take control of a victim's forum account. This vulnerability is patched in commit number 846d012151514b35ce42a1636c7d70f6dcee879e of the discourse-patreon plugin. Out of an abundance of caution, any Discourse accounts which have logged in with an unverified-email Patreon account will be logged out and asked to verify their email address on their next login. As a workaround, disable the patreon integration and log out all users with associated Patreon accounts.\n\n- CVE-2021-3632: A flaw was found in Keycloak. This vulnerability allows anyone to register a new security device or key when there is not a device already registered for any user by using the WebAuthn password-less login flow.\n\n- CVE-2022-46170: CodeIgniter is a PHP full-stack web framework. When an application uses (1) multiple session cookies (e.g., one for user pages and one for admin pages) and (2) a session handler is set to `DatabaseHandler`, `MemcachedHandler`, or `RedisHandler`, then if an attacker gets one session cookie (e.g., one for user pages), they may be able to access pages that require another session cookie (e.g., for admin pages). This issue has been patched, please upgrade to version 4.2.11 or later. As a workaround, use only one session cookie.\n\n- CVE-2022-46316: A thread security vulnerability exists in the authentication process. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may affect data integrity, confidentiality, and availability.\n\n- CVE-2022-30034: Flower, a web UI for the Celery Python RPC framework, all versions as of 05-02-2022 is vulnerable to an OAuth authentication bypass. An attacker could then access the Flower API to discover and invoke arbitrary Celery RPC calls or deny service by shutting down Celery task nodes.\n\n- CVE-2022-30124: An improper authentication vulnerability exists in Rocket.Chat Mobile App <4.14.1.22788 that allowed an attacker with physical access to a mobile device to bypass local authentication (PIN code).\n\n- CVE-2021-43414: An issue was discovered in GNU Hurd before 0.9 20210404-9. The use of an authentication protocol in the proc server is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks, which can be exploited for local privilege escalation to get full root access.\n\n- CVE-2022-21684: Discourse is an open source discussion platform. Versions prior to 2.7.13 in `stable`, 2.8.0.beta11 in `beta`, and 2.8.0.beta11 in `tests-passed` allow some users to log in to a community before they should be able to do so. A user invited via email to a forum with `must_approve_users` enabled is going to be automatically logged in, bypassing the check that does not allow unapproved users to sign in. They will be able to do everything an approved user can do. If they logout, they cannot log back in. This issue is patched in the `stable` version 2.7.13, `beta` version 2.8.0.beta11, and `tests-passed` version 2.8.0.beta11. One may disable invites as a workaround. Administrators can increase `min_trust_level_to_allow_invite` to reduce the attack surface to more trusted users.\n\n- CVE-2022-2303: An issue has been discovered in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions before 15.0.5, all versions starting from 15.1 before 15.1.4, all versions starting from 15.2 before 15.2.1. It may be possible for group members to bypass 2FA enforcement enabled at the group level by using Resource Owner Password Credentials grant to obtain an access token without using 2FA.\n\n- CVE-2022-34908: An issue was discovered in the A4N (Aremis 4 Nomad) application 1.5.0 for Android. It possesses an authentication mechanism; however, some features do not require any token or cookie in a request. Therefore, an attacker may send a simple HTTP request to the right endpoint, and obtain authorization to retrieve application data.\n\n- CVE-2022-36755: D-Link DIR845L A1 contains a authentication vulnerability via an AUTHORIZED_GROUP=1 value, as demonstrated by a request for getcfg.php.\n\n- CVE-2022-43400: A vulnerability has been identified in Siveillance Video Mobile Server V2022 R2 (All versions < V22.2a (80)).

This allows an attacker to use one AK, EK pair from a real TPM to pass EK validation and give the verifier an AK of a software TPM. A successful attack breaks the entire chain of trust because a not validated AK is used by the verifier. This issue is worse if the validation happens first and then the agent gets added to the verifier because the timing is easier and the verifier does not validate the regcount entry being equal to 1,\n\n- CVE-2022-45124: An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the User authentication functionality of WellinTech KingHistorian 35.01.00.05. A specially crafted network packet can lead to a disclosure of sensitive information.

It mishandles software updates such that local third-party apps can provide a spoofed software update file that contains an arbitrary shell script and arbitrary ARM binary, where both will be executed as the root user with an SELinux domain named osi. To exploit this vulnerability, a local third-party app needs to have write access to external storage to write the spoofed update at the expected path. The vulnerable system binary (i.e., /system/bin/osi_bin) does not perform any authentication of the update file beyond ensuring that it is encrypted with an AES key (that is hard-coded in the vulnerable system binary). Processes executing with the osi SELinux domain can programmatically perform the following actions: install apps, grant runtime permissions to apps (including permissions with protection levels of dangerous and development), access extensive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) using the programmatically grant permissions, uninstall apps, set the default launcher app to a malicious launcher app that spoofs other apps, set a network proxy to intercept network traffic, unload kernel modules, set the default keyboard to a keyboard that has keylogging functionality, examine notification contents, send text messages, and more. The spoofed update can optionally contain an arbitrary ARM binary that will be locally stored in internal storage and executed at system startup to achieve persistent code execution as the root user with the osi SELinux domain. This ARM binary will continue to execute at startup even if the app that provided the spoofed update is uninstalled.\n\n- CVE-2020-7352: The GalaxyClientService component of GOG Galaxy runs with elevated SYSTEM privileges in a Windows environment. Due to the software shipping with embedded, static RSA private key, an attacker with this key material and local user permissions can effectively send any operating system command to the service for execution in this elevated context.

          "matched_text": "CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password\n\nType: Variant\n\nStatus: Draft\n\nDescription:\n\nThe product contains a hard-coded password, which it uses for its own inbound authentication or for outbound communication to external components.\n\nExtended Details:\n\n\n\nA hard-coded password typically leads to a significant authentication failure that can be difficult for the system administrator to detect. Once detected, it can be difficult to fix, so the administrator may be forced into disabling the product entirely. There are two main variations:\n\n```\n\t\tInbound: the product contains an authentication mechanism that checks for a hard-coded password.\n\t\tOutbound: the product connects to another system or component, and it contains hard-coded password for connecting to that component.\n```\nIn the Inbound variant, a default administration account is created, and a simple password is hard-coded into the product and associated with that account. This hard-coded password is the same for each installation of the product, and it usually cannot be changed or disabled by system administrators without manually modifying the program, or otherwise patching the product. If the password is ever discovered or published (a common occurrence on the Internet), then anybody with knowledge of this password can access the product. Finally, since all installations of the product will have the same password, even across different organizations, this enables massive attacks such as worms to take place.\n\nThe Outbound variant applies to front-end systems that authenticate with a back-end service. The back-end service may require a fixed password which can be easily discovered. The programmer may simply hard-code those back-end credentials into the front-end product. Any user of that program may be able to extract the password. Client-side systems with hard-coded passwords pose even more of a threat, since the extraction of a password from a binary is usually very simple.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-29964: Distributed Control System (DCS) has hard-coded passwords for local shell access\n\n- CVE-2021-37555: Telnet service for IoT feeder for dogs and cats has hard-coded password [REF-1288]\n\n- CVE-2021-35033: Firmware for a WiFi router uses a hard-coded password for a BusyBox shell, allowing bypass of authentication through the UART port\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-27438: The software contains a hard-coded password it uses for its own inbound authentication or for outbound communication to external components on the Reason DR60 (all firmware versions prior to 02A04.1).\n\n- CVE-2021-34757: Multiple vulnerabilities in Cisco Business 220 Series Smart Switches firmware could allow an attacker with Administrator privileges to access sensitive login credentials or reconfigure the passwords on the user account.

In affected versions envoy incorrectly handled a URI '#fragment' element as part of the path element. Envoy is configured with an RBAC filter for authorization or similar mechanism with an explicit case of a final \"/admin\" path element, or is using a negative assertion with final path element of \"/admin\". The client sends request to \"/app1/admin#foo\". In Envoy prior to 1.18.0, or 1.18.0+ configured with path_normalization=false. Envoy treats fragment as a suffix of the query string when present, or as a suffix of the path when query string is absent, so it evaluates the final path element as \"/admin#foo\" and mismatches with the configured \"/admin\" path element. In Envoy 1.18.0+ configured with path_normalization=true. Envoy transforms this to /app1/admin%23foo and mismatches with the configured /admin prefix. The resulting URI is sent to the next server-agent with the offending \"#foo\" fragment which violates RFC3986 or with the nonsensical \"%23foo\" text appended. A specifically constructed request with URI containing '#fragment' element delivered by an untrusted client in the presence of path based request authorization resulting in escalation of Privileges when path based request authorization extensions.

The CWE usage of \"access control\" is intended as a general term for the various mechanisms that restrict which users can access which resources, and \"authorization\" is more narrowly defined. It is unlikely that there will be community consensus on the use of these terms.\n\nDescription:\n\nThe product does not restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor.\n\nExtended Details:\n\n\n\nAccess control involves the use of several protection mechanisms such as:\n\n\n  - Authentication (proving the identity of an actor)\n\n  - Authorization (ensuring that a given actor can access a resource), and\n\n  - Accountability (tracking of activities that were performed)\n\nWhen any mechanism is not applied or otherwise fails, attackers can compromise the security of the product by gaining privileges, reading sensitive information, executing commands, evading detection, etc.\n\nThere are two distinct behaviors that can introduce access control weaknesses:\n\n\n  - Specification: incorrect privileges, permissions, ownership, etc. are explicitly specified for either the user or the resource (for example, setting a password file to be world-writable, or giving administrator capabilities to a guest user). This action could be performed by the program or the administrator.\n\n  - Enforcement: the mechanism contains errors that prevent it from properly enforcing the specified access control requirements (e.g., allowing the user to specify their own privileges, or allowing a syntactically-incorrect ACL to produce insecure settings). This problem occurs within the program itself, in that it does not actually enforce the intended security policy that the administrator specifies.\n\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-24985: A form hosting website only checks the session authentication status for a single form, making it possible to bypass authentication when there are multiple forms\n\n- CVE-2022-29238: Access-control setting in web-based document collaboration tool is not properly implemented by the code, which prevents listing hidden directories but does not prevent direct requests to files in those directories.\n\n- CVE-2022-23607: Python-based HTTP library did not scope cookies to a particular domain such that \"supercookies\" could be sent to any domain on redirect\n\n- CVE-2021-21972: Chain: Cloud computing virtualization platform does not require authentication for upload of a tar format file (CWE-306), then uses .. path traversal sequences (CWE-23) in the file to access unexpected files, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2021-37415: IT management product does not perform authentication for some REST API requests, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2021-35033: Firmware for a WiFi router uses a hard-coded password for a BusyBox shell, allowing bypass of authentication through the UART port\n\n- CVE-2020-10263: Bluetooth speaker does not require authentication for the debug functionality on the UART port, allowing root shell access\n\n- CVE-2020-13927: Default setting in workflow management product allows all API requests without authentication, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2010-4624: Bulletin board applies restrictions on number of images during post creation, but does not enforce this on editing.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-1581: Multiple vulnerabilities in the web UI and API endpoints of Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) or Cisco Cloud APIC could allow a remote attacker to perform a command injection or file upload attack on an affected system.

This bug does not directly allow files to be read, modified, or executed without an additional cooperating process. This bug has been fixed in containerd 1.5.4 and 1.4.8. As a workaround, ensure that users only pull images from trusted sources. Linux security modules (LSMs) like SELinux and AppArmor can limit the files potentially affected by this bug through policies and profiles that prevent containerd from interacting with specific files.\n\n- CVE-2020-14335: A flaw was found in Red Hat Satellite, which allows a privileged attacker to read OMAPI secrets through the ISC DHCP of Smart-Proxy.

Such issue could be chained with an open redirect (CVE-2021-24358) in version below 4.1.10, to include a crafted password reset link in the email, which would lead to an account takeover.\n\n- CVE-2021-34785: Multiple vulnerabilities in Cisco BroadWorks CommPilot Application Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to delete arbitrary user accounts or gain elevated privileges on an affected system.\n\n- CVE-2021-34786: Multiple vulnerabilities in Cisco BroadWorks CommPilot Application Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to delete arbitrary user accounts or gain elevated privileges on an affected system.\n\n- CVE-2020-16839: On Crestron DM-NVX-DIR, DM-NVX-DIR80, and DM-NVX-ENT devices before the DM-XIO/1-0-3-802 patch, the password can be changed by sending an unauthenticated WebSocket request.\n\n- CVE-2021-40101: An issue was discovered in Concrete CMS before 8.5.7. The Dashboard allows a user's password to be changed without a prompt for the current password.\n\n- CVE-2020-20466: White Shark System (WSS) 1.3.2 is vulnerable to unauthorized access via user_edit_password.php, remote attackers can modify the password of any user.\n\n- CVE-2021-34977: This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to bypass authentication on affected installations of NETGEAR R7000 1.0.11.116_10.2.100 routers. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the processing of SOAP requests. The issue results from the lack of proper authentication verification before performing a password reset. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to reset the admin password. Was ZDI-CAN-13483.\n\n- CVE-2021-44152: An issue was discovered in Reprise RLM 14.2. Because /goform/change_password_process does not verify authentication or authorization, an unauthenticated user can change the password of any existing user. This allows an attacker to change the password of any known user, thereby preventing valid users from accessing the system and granting the attacker full access to that user's account.\n\n- CVE-2021-29394: Account Hijacking in /northstar/Admin/changePassword.jsp in Northstar Technologies Inc NorthStar Club Management 6.3 allows remote authenticated users to change the password of any targeted user accounts via lack of proper authorization in the user-controlled \"userID\" parameter of the HTTP POST request.\n\n- CVE-2022-21935: A vulnerability in Metasys ADS/ADX/OAS 10 versions prior to 10.1.5 and Metasys ADS/ADX/OAS 11 versions prior to 11.0.2 allows unverified password change.\n\n- CVE-2022-27484: A unverified password change in Fortinet FortiADC version 6.2.0 through 6.2.3, 6.1.x, 6.0.x, 5.x.x allows an authenticated attacker to bypass the Old Password check in the password change form via a crafted HTTP request.\n\n- CVE-2022-3152: Unverified Password Change in GitHub repository phpfusion/phpfusion prior to 9.10.20.\n\n- CVE-2022-21934: Under certain circumstances an authenticated user could lock other users out of the system or take over their accounts in Metasys ADS/ADX/OAS server 10 versions prior to 10.1.5 and Metasys ADS/ADX/OAS server 11 versions prior to 11.0.2.\n\n- CVE-2022-24551: A flaw was found in StarWind Stack. The endpoint for setting a new password doesn\u2019t check the current username and old password. An attacker could reset any local user password (including system/administrator user) using any available user This affects StarWind SAN and NAS v0.2 build 1633.\n\n- CVE-2022-0862: A lack of password change protection vulnerability in a depreciated API of McAfee Enterprise ePolicy Orchestrator (ePO) prior to 5.10 Update 13 allows a remote attacker to change the password of a compromised session without knowing the existing user's password. This functionality was removed from the User Interface in ePO 10 and the API has now been disabled. Other protection is in place to reduce the likelihood of this being successful through sending a link to a logged in user.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-1390 (ChildOf)",

IBM X-Force ID: 196217.\n\n- CVE-2021-25309: The telnet administrator service running on port 650 on Gigaset DX600A v41.00-175 devices does not implement any lockout or throttling functionality. This situation (together with the weak password policy that forces a 4-digit password) allows remote attackers to easily obtain administrative access via brute-force attacks.\n\n- CVE-2022-3993: Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts in GitHub repository kareadita/kavita prior to 0.6.0.3. \n\n- CVE-2022-22485: In some cases, an unsuccessful attempt to log into IBM Spectrum Protect Operations Center 8.1.0.000 through 8.1.14.000 does not cause the administrator's invalid sign-on count to be incremented on the IBM Spectrum Protect Server. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using brute force techniques to gain unauthorized administrative access to the IBM Spectrum Protect Server. IBM X-Force ID: 226325.\n\n- CVE-2022-22487: An IBM Spectrum Protect storage agent could allow a remote attacker to perform a brute force attack by allowing unlimited attempts to login to the storage agent without locking the administrative ID. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using brute force techniques to gain unauthorized administrative access to both the IBM Spectrum Protect storage agent and the IBM Spectrum Protect Server 8.1.0.000 through 8.1.14 with which it communicates. IBM X-Force ID: 226326.\n\n- CVE-2022-35925: BookWyrm is a social network for tracking reading. Versions prior to 0.4.5 were found to lack rate limiting on authentication views which allows brute-force attacks. This issue has been patched in version 0.4.5. Admins with existing instances will need to update their `nginx.conf` file that was created when the instance was set up. Users are advised advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may update their nginx.conf files with the changes manually.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-1390 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-287 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-799 (ChildOf)",

Due to a bug in ASF code `POST /Api/ASF` ASF API endpoint responsible for updating global ASF config incorrectly removed `IPCPassword` from the resulting config when the caller did not specify it explicitly. Due to the above, it was possible for the user to accidentally remove `IPCPassword` security measure from his IPC interface when updating global ASF config, which exists as part of global config update functionality in ASF-ui. Removal of `IPCPassword` possesses a security risk, as unauthorized users may in result access the IPC interface after such modification. The issue is patched in ASF V5.1.2.4 and future versions. We recommend to manually verify that `IPCPassword` is specified after update, and if not, set it accordingly. In default settings, ASF is configured to allow IPC access from `localhost` only and should not affect majority of users.\n\n- CVE-2021-3282: HashiCorp Vault Enterprise 1.6.0 & 1.6.1 allowed the `remove-peer` raft operator command to be executed against DR secondaries without authentication.

Prior to version 1.10.7, FreeSWITCH does not authenticate SIP MESSAGE requests, leading to spam and message spoofing. By default, SIP requests of the type MESSAGE (RFC 3428) are not authenticated in the affected versions of FreeSWITCH. MESSAGE requests are relayed to SIP user agents registered with the FreeSWITCH server without requiring any authentication. Although this behaviour can be changed by setting the `auth-messages` parameter to `true`, it is not the default setting. Abuse of this security issue allows attackers to send SIP MESSAGE messages to any SIP user agent that is registered with the server without requiring authentication. Additionally, since no authentication is required, chat messages can be spoofed to appear to come from trusted entities. Therefore, abuse can lead to spam and enable social engineering, phishing and similar attacks. This issue is patched in version 1.10.7. Maintainers recommend that this SIP message type is authenticated by default so that FreeSWITCH administrators do not need to be explicitly set the `auth-messages` parameter. When following such a recommendation, a new parameter can be introduced to explicitly disable authentication.\n\n- CVE-2021-38412: Properly formatted POST requests to multiple resources on the HTTP and HTTPS web servers of the Digi PortServer TS 16 Rack device do not require authentication or authentication tokens.

By default, SIP requests of the type SUBSCRIBE are not authenticated in the affected versions of FreeSWITCH. Abuse of this security issue allows attackers to subscribe to user agent event notifications without the need to authenticate. This abuse poses privacy concerns and might lead to social engineering or similar attacks. For example, attackers may be able to monitor the status of target SIP extensions. Although this issue was fixed in version v1.10.6, installations upgraded to the fixed version of FreeSWITCH from an older version, may still be vulnerable if the configuration is not updated accordingly. Software upgrades do not update the configuration by default. SIP SUBSCRIBE messages should be authenticated by default so that FreeSWITCH administrators do not need to explicitly set the `auth-subscriptions` parameter. When following such a recommendation, a new parameter can be introduced to explicitly disable authentication.\n\n- CVE-2020-25566: In SapphireIMS 5.0, it is possible to take over an account by sending a request to the Save_Password form as shown in POC.

A malicious user can modify the contents of a `confirmation_token` input during the two-factor authentication process to reference a cache value not associated with the login attempt. In rare cases this can allow a malicious actor to authenticate as a random user in the Panel. The malicious user must target an account with two-factor authentication enabled, and then must provide a correct two-factor authentication token before being authenticated as that user. Due to a validation flaw in the logic handling user authentication during the two-factor authentication process a malicious user can trick the system into loading credentials for an arbitrary user by modifying the token sent to the server. This authentication flaw is present in the `LoginCheckpointController@__invoke` method which handles two-factor authentication for a user. This controller looks for a request input parameter called `confirmation_token` which is expected to be a 64 character random alpha-numeric string that references a value within the Panel's cache containing a `user_id` value. This value is then used to fetch the user that attempted to login, and lookup their two-factor authentication token. Due to the design of this system, any element in the cache that contains only digits could be referenced by a malicious user, and whatever value is stored at that position would be used as the `user_id`. There are a few different areas of the Panel that store values into the cache that are integers, and a user who determines what those cache keys are could pass one of those keys which would cause this code pathway to reference an arbitrary user. At its heart this is a high-risk login bypass vulnerability. However, there are a few additional conditions that must be met in order for this to be successfully executed, notably: 1.) The account referenced by the malicious cache key must have two-factor authentication enabled. An account without two-factor authentication would cause an exception to be triggered by the authentication logic, thusly exiting this authentication flow. 2.) Even if the malicious user is able to reference a valid cache key that references a valid user account with two-factor authentication, they must provide a valid two-factor authentication token. However, due to the design of this endpoint once a valid user account is found with two-factor authentication enabled there is no rate-limiting present, thusly allowing an attacker to brute force combinations until successful. This leads to a third condition that must be met: 3.) For the duration of this attack sequence the cache key being referenced must continue to exist with a valid `user_id` value. Depending on the specific key being used for this attack, this value may disappear quickly, or be changed by other random user interactions on the Panel, outside the control of the attacker. In order to mitigate this vulnerability the underlying authentication logic was changed to use an encrypted session store that the user is therefore unable to control the value of. This completely removed the use of a user-controlled value being used. In addition, the code was audited to ensure this type of vulnerability is not present elsewhere.\n\n- CVE-2021-42338: 4MOSAn GCB Doctor\u2019s login page has improper validation of Cookie, which allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to bypass authentication by code injection in cookie, and arbitrarily manipulate the system or interrupt services by upload and execution of arbitrary files.\n\n- CVE-2021-1541: Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business 220 Series Smart Switches could allow an attacker to do the following: Hijack a user session Execute arbitrary commands as a root user on the underlying operating system Conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack Conduct an HTML injection attack For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2021-41317: XSS Hunter Express before 2021-09-17 does not properly enforce authentication requirements for paths.\n\n- CVE-2021-29012: DMA Softlab Radius Manager 4.4.0 assigns the same session cookie to every admin session.

This affects users of spnego-http-auth-nginx-module that have enabled basic authentication. This is fixed in version 1.1.1 of spnego-http-auth-nginx-module. As a workaround, one may disable basic authentication.\n\n- CVE-2021-21378: Envoy is a cloud-native high-performance edge/middle/service proxy. In Envoy version 1.17.0 an attacker can bypass authentication by presenting a JWT token with an issuer that is not in the provider list when Envoy's JWT Authentication filter is configured with the `allow_missing` requirement under `requires_any` due to a mistake in implementation. Envoy's JWT Authentication filter can be configured with the `allow_missing` requirement that will be satisfied if JWT is missing (JwtMissed error) and fail if JWT is presented or invalid. Due to a mistake in implementation, a JwtUnknownIssuer error was mistakenly converted to JwtMissed when `requires_any` was configured. So if `allow_missing` was configured under `requires_any`, an attacker can bypass authentication by presenting a JWT token with an issuer that is not in the provider list. Integrity may be impacted depending on configuration if the JWT token is used to protect against writes or modifications. This regression was introduced on 2020/11/12 in PR 13839 which fixed handling `allow_missing` under RequiresAny in a JwtRequirement (see issue 13458). The AnyVerifier aggregates the children verifiers' results into a final status where JwtMissing is the default error. However, a JwtUnknownIssuer was mistakenly treated the same as a JwtMissing error and the resulting final aggregation was the default JwtMissing. As a result, `allow_missing` would allow a JWT token with an unknown issuer status. This is fixed in version 1.17.1 by PR 15194. The fix works by preferring JwtUnknownIssuer over a JwtMissing error, fixing the accidental conversion and bypass with `allow_missing`. A user could detect whether a bypass occurred if they have Envoy logs enabled with debug verbosity. Users can enable component level debug logs for JWT. The JWT filter logs will indicate that there is a request with a JWT token and a failure that the JWT token is missing.\n\n- CVE-2021-21513: Dell EMC OpenManage Server Administrator (OMSA) version 9.5 Microsoft Windows installations with Distributed Web Server (DWS) enabled configuration contains an authentication bypass vulnerability.

Restricting frontend login to specific users, organized in different storage folders (partitions), can be bypassed. A potential attacker might use this ambiguity in usernames to get access to a different account - however, credentials must be known to the adversary. This issue is patched in versions 8.7.49 ELTS, 9.5.38 ELTS, 10.4.33, 11.5.20, 12.1.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-23600: fleet is an open source device management, built on osquery. Versions prior to 4.9.1 expose a limited ability to spoof SAML authentication with missing audience verification. This impacts deployments using SAML SSO in two specific cases: 1. A malicious or compromised Service Provider (SP) could reuse the SAML response to log into Fleet as a user -- only if the user has an account with the same email in Fleet, _and_ the user signs into the malicious SP via SAML SSO from the same Identity Provider (IdP) configured with Fleet. 2. A user with an account in Fleet could reuse a SAML response intended for another SP to log into Fleet. This is only a concern if the user is blocked from Fleet in the IdP, but continues to have an account in Fleet. If the user is blocked from the IdP entirely, this cannot be exploited. Fleet 4.9.1 resolves this issue. Users unable to upgrade should: Reduce the length of sessions on your IdP to reduce the window for malicious re-use, Limit the amount of SAML Service Providers/Applications used by user accounts with access to Fleet, and When removing access to Fleet in the IdP, delete the Fleet user from Fleet as well.\n\n- CVE-2022-24259: An incorrect check in the component cdr.php of Voipmonitor GUI before v24.96 allows unauthenticated attackers to escalate privileges via a crafted request.\n\n- CVE-2022-24883: FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). Prior to version 2.7.0, server side authentication against a `SAM` file might be successful for invalid credentials if the server has configured an invalid `SAM` file path. FreeRDP based clients are not affected. RDP server implementations using FreeRDP to authenticate against a `SAM` file are affected. Version 2.7.0 contains a fix for this issue. As a workaround, use custom authentication via `HashCallback` and/or ensure the `SAM` database path configured is valid and the application has file handles left.\n\n- CVE-2022-24885: Nextcloud Android app is the Android client for Nextcloud, a self-hosted productivity platform. Prior to version 3.19.1, users can bypass a lock on the Nextcloud app on an Android device by repeatedly reopening the app. Version 3.19.1 contains a fix for the problem. There are currently no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-24976: Atheme IRC Services before 7.2.12, when used in conjunction with InspIRCd, allows authentication bypass by ending an IRC handshake at a certain point during a challenge-response login sequence.\n\n- CVE-2022-2533: An issue has been discovered in GitLab affecting all versions starting from 12.10 before 15.1.6, all versions starting from 15.2 before 15.2.4, all versions starting from 15.3 before 15.3.2.

In versions prior to 2.4.3, when using Portable Authentication Modules (PAM) for user authentication, if a user presented valid credentials but the account is disabled or otherwise not allowed to access the host (such as an expired password), it would still be accepted for access to Arvados. Other authentication methods (LDAP, OpenID Connect) supported by Arvados are not affected by this flaw. This issue is patched in version 2.4.3. Workaround for this issue is to migrate to a different authentication method supported by Arvados, such as LDAP.\n\n- CVE-2022-39263: `@next-auth/upstash-redis-adapter` is the Upstash Redis adapter for NextAuth.js, which provides authentication for Next.js. Applications that use `next-auth` Email Provider and `@next-auth/upstash-redis-adapter` before v3.0.2 are affected by this vulnerability. The Upstash Redis adapter implementation did not check for both the identifier (email) and the token, but only checking for the identifier when verifying the token in the email callback flow. An attacker who knows about the victim's email could easily sign in as the victim, given the attacker also knows about the verification token's expired duration. The vulnerability is patched in v3.0.2. A workaround is available. Using Advanced Initialization, developers can check the requests and compare the query's token and identifier before proceeding.\n\n- CVE-2022-39355: Discourse Patreon enables syncronization between Discourse Groups and Patreon rewards.

This vulnerability is patched in commit number 846d012151514b35ce42a1636c7d70f6dcee879e of the discourse-patreon plugin. Out of an abundance of caution, any Discourse accounts which have logged in with an unverified-email Patreon account will be logged out and asked to verify their email address on their next login. As a workaround, disable the patreon integration and log out all users with associated Patreon accounts.\n\n- CVE-2021-3632: A flaw was found in Keycloak. This vulnerability allows anyone to register a new security device or key when there is not a device already registered for any user by using the WebAuthn password-less login flow.\n\n- CVE-2022-46170: CodeIgniter is a PHP full-stack web framework. When an application uses (1) multiple session cookies (e.g., one for user pages and one for admin pages) and (2) a session handler is set to `DatabaseHandler`, `MemcachedHandler`, or `RedisHandler`, then if an attacker gets one session cookie (e.g., one for user pages), they may be able to access pages that require another session cookie (e.g., for admin pages). This issue has been patched, please upgrade to version 4.2.11 or later. As a workaround, use only one session cookie.\n\n- CVE-2022-46316: A thread security vulnerability exists in the authentication process. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may affect data integrity, confidentiality, and availability.\n\n- CVE-2022-30034: Flower, a web UI for the Celery Python RPC framework, all versions as of 05-02-2022 is vulnerable to an OAuth authentication bypass.

Versions prior to 2.7.13 in `stable`, 2.8.0.beta11 in `beta`, and 2.8.0.beta11 in `tests-passed` allow some users to log in to a community before they should be able to do so. A user invited via email to a forum with `must_approve_users` enabled is going to be automatically logged in, bypassing the check that does not allow unapproved users to sign in. They will be able to do everything an approved user can do. If they logout, they cannot log back in. This issue is patched in the `stable` version 2.7.13, `beta` version 2.8.0.beta11, and `tests-passed` version 2.8.0.beta11. One may disable invites as a workaround.

It mishandles software updates such that local third-party apps can provide a spoofed software update file that contains an arbitrary shell script and arbitrary ARM binary, where both will be executed as the root user with an SELinux domain named osi. To exploit this vulnerability, a local third-party app needs to have write access to external storage to write the spoofed update at the expected path. The vulnerable system binary (i.e., /system/bin/osi_bin) does not perform any authentication of the update file beyond ensuring that it is encrypted with an AES key (that is hard-coded in the vulnerable system binary). Processes executing with the osi SELinux domain can programmatically perform the following actions: install apps, grant runtime permissions to apps (including permissions with protection levels of dangerous and development), access extensive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) using the programmatically grant permissions, uninstall apps, set the default launcher app to a malicious launcher app that spoofs other apps, set a network proxy to intercept network traffic, unload kernel modules, set the default keyboard to a keyboard that has keylogging functionality, examine notification contents, send text messages, and more. The spoofed update can optionally contain an arbitrary ARM binary that will be locally stored in internal storage and executed at system startup to achieve persistent code execution as the root user with the osi SELinux domain. This ARM binary will continue to execute at startup even if the app that provided the spoofed update is uninstalled.\n\n- CVE-2020-7352: The GalaxyClientService component of GOG Galaxy runs with elevated SYSTEM privileges in a Windows environment.

            "matched_text": "CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password\n\nType: Variant\n\nStatus: Draft\n\nDescription:\n\nThe product contains a hard-coded password, which it uses for its own inbound authentication or for outbound communication to external components.\n\nExtended Details:\n\n\n\nA hard-coded password typically leads to a significant authentication failure that can be difficult for the system administrator to detect. Once detected, it can be difficult to fix, so the administrator may be forced into disabling the product entirely. There are two main variations:\n\n```\n\t\tInbound: the product contains an authentication mechanism that checks for a hard-coded password.\n\t\tOutbound: the product connects to another system or component, and it contains hard-coded password for connecting to that component.\n```\nIn the Inbound variant, a default administration account is created, and a simple password is hard-coded into the product and associated with that account. This hard-coded password is the same for each installation of the product, and it usually cannot be changed or disabled by system administrators without manually modifying the program, or otherwise patching the product. If the password is ever discovered or published (a common occurrence on the Internet), then anybody with knowledge of this password can access the product. Finally, since all installations of the product will have the same password, even across different organizations, this enables massive attacks such as worms to take place.\n\nThe Outbound variant applies to front-end systems that authenticate with a back-end service. The back-end service may require a fixed password which can be easily discovered. The programmer may simply hard-code those back-end credentials into the front-end product. Any user of that program may be able to extract the password. Client-side systems with hard-coded passwords pose even more of a threat, since the extraction of a password from a binary is usually very simple.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-29964: Distributed Control System (DCS) has hard-coded passwords for local shell access\n\n- CVE-2021-37555: Telnet service for IoT feeder for dogs and cats has hard-coded password [REF-1288]\n\n- CVE-2021-35033: Firmware for a WiFi router uses a hard-coded password for a BusyBox shell, allowing bypass of authentication through the UART port\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-27438: The software contains a hard-coded password it uses for its own inbound authentication or for outbound communication to external components on the Reason DR60 (all firmware versions prior to 02A04.1).\n\n- CVE-2021-34757: Multiple vulnerabilities in Cisco Business 220 Series Smart Switches firmware could allow an attacker with Administrator privileges to access sensitive login credentials or reconfigure the passwords on the user account.

In affected versions envoy incorrectly handled a URI '#fragment' element as part of the path element. Envoy is configured with an RBAC filter for authorization or similar mechanism with an explicit case of a final \"/admin\" path element, or is using a negative assertion with final path element of \"/admin\". The client sends request to \"/app1/admin#foo\". In Envoy prior to 1.18.0, or 1.18.0+ configured with path_normalization=false. Envoy treats fragment as a suffix of the query string when present, or as a suffix of the path when query string is absent, so it evaluates the final path element as \"/admin#foo\" and mismatches with the configured \"/admin\" path element. In Envoy 1.18.0+ configured with path_normalization=true. Envoy transforms this to /app1/admin%23foo and mismatches with the configured /admin prefix. The resulting URI is sent to the next server-agent with the offending \"#foo\" fragment which violates RFC3986 or with the nonsensical \"%23foo\" text appended. A specifically constructed request with URI containing '#fragment' element delivered by an untrusted client in the presence of path based request authorization resulting in escalation of Privileges when path based request authorization extensions.

The CWE usage of \"access control\" is intended as a general term for the various mechanisms that restrict which users can access which resources, and \"authorization\" is more narrowly defined. It is unlikely that there will be community consensus on the use of these terms.\n\nDescription:\n\nThe product does not restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor.\n\nExtended Details:\n\n\n\nAccess control involves the use of several protection mechanisms such as:\n\n\n  - Authentication (proving the identity of an actor)\n\n  - Authorization (ensuring that a given actor can access a resource), and\n\n  - Accountability (tracking of activities that were performed)\n\nWhen any mechanism is not applied or otherwise fails, attackers can compromise the security of the product by gaining privileges, reading sensitive information, executing commands, evading detection, etc.\n\nThere are two distinct behaviors that can introduce access control weaknesses:\n\n\n  - Specification: incorrect privileges, permissions, ownership, etc. are explicitly specified for either the user or the resource (for example, setting a password file to be world-writable, or giving administrator capabilities to a guest user). This action could be performed by the program or the administrator.\n\n  - Enforcement: the mechanism contains errors that prevent it from properly enforcing the specified access control requirements (e.g., allowing the user to specify their own privileges, or allowing a syntactically-incorrect ACL to produce insecure settings). This problem occurs within the program itself, in that it does not actually enforce the intended security policy that the administrator specifies.\n\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-24985: A form hosting website only checks the session authentication status for a single form, making it possible to bypass authentication when there are multiple forms\n\n- CVE-2022-29238: Access-control setting in web-based document collaboration tool is not properly implemented by the code, which prevents listing hidden directories but does not prevent direct requests to files in those directories.\n\n- CVE-2022-23607: Python-based HTTP library did not scope cookies to a particular domain such that \"supercookies\" could be sent to any domain on redirect\n\n- CVE-2021-21972: Chain: Cloud computing virtualization platform does not require authentication for upload of a tar format file (CWE-306), then uses .. path traversal sequences (CWE-23) in the file to access unexpected files, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2021-37415: IT management product does not perform authentication for some REST API requests, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2021-35033: Firmware for a WiFi router uses a hard-coded password for a BusyBox shell, allowing bypass of authentication through the UART port\n\n- CVE-2020-10263: Bluetooth speaker does not require authentication for the debug functionality on the UART port, allowing root shell access\n\n- CVE-2020-13927: Default setting in workflow management product allows all API requests without authentication, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2010-4624: Bulletin board applies restrictions on number of images during post creation, but does not enforce this on editing.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-1581: Multiple vulnerabilities in the web UI and API endpoints of Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) or Cisco Cloud APIC could allow a remote attacker to perform a command injection or file upload attack on an affected system.

This is especially dangerous when the resource is related to program configuration, execution, or sensitive user data. For example, consider a misconfigured storage account for the cloud that can be read or written by a public or anonymous user.\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-29527: Go application for cloud management creates a world-writable sudoers file that allows local attackers to inject sudo rules and escalate privileges to root by winning a race condition.\n\n- CVE-2009-3482: Anti-virus product sets insecure \"Everyone: Full Control\" permissions for files under the \"Program Files\" folder, allowing attackers to replace executables with Trojan horses.\n\n- CVE-2009-3897: Product creates directories with 0777 permissions at installation, allowing users to gain privileges and access a socket used for authentication.\n\n- CVE-2009-3489: Photo editor installs a service with an insecure security descriptor, allowing users to stop or start the service, or execute commands as SYSTEM.\n\n- CVE-2020-15708: socket created with insecure permissions\n\n- CVE-2009-3289: Library function copies a file to a new target and uses the source file's permissions for the target, which is incorrect when the source file is a symbolic link, which typically has 0777 permissions.\n\n- CVE-2009-0115: Device driver uses world-writable permissions for a socket file, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary commands.\n\n- CVE-2009-1073: LDAP server stores a cleartext password in a world-readable file.\n\n- CVE-2009-0141: Terminal emulator creates TTY devices with world-writable permissions, allowing an attacker to write to the terminals of other users.\n\n- CVE-2008-0662: VPN product stores user credentials in a registry key with \"Everyone: Full Control\" permissions, allowing attackers to steal the credentials.\n\n- CVE-2008-0322: Driver installs its device interface with \"Everyone: Write\" permissions.\n\n- CVE-2009-3939: Driver installs a file with world-writable permissions.\n\n- CVE-2009-3611: Product changes permissions to 0777 before deleting a backup; the permissions stay insecure for subsequent backups.\n\n- CVE-2007-6033: Product creates a share with \"Everyone: Full Control\" permissions, allowing arbitrary program execution.\n\n- CVE-2007-5544: Product uses \"Everyone: Full Control\" permissions for memory-mapped files (shared memory) in inter-process communication, allowing attackers to tamper with a session.\n\n- CVE-2005-4868: Database product uses read/write permissions for everyone for its shared memory, allowing theft of credentials.\n\n- CVE-2004-1714: Security product uses \"Everyone: Full Control\" permissions for its configuration files.\n\n- CVE-2001-0006: \"Everyone: Full Control\" permissions assigned to a mutex allows users to disable network connectivity.\n\n- CVE-2002-0969: Chain: database product contains buffer overflow that is only reachable through a .ini configuration file - which has \"Everyone: Full Control\" permissions.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-26941: A local (authenticated) low-privileged user can exploit a behavior in an ESET installer to achieve arbitrary file overwrite (deletion) of any file via a symlink, due to insecure permissions. The possibility of exploiting this vulnerability is limited and can only take place during the installation phase of ESET products. Furthermore, exploitation can only succeed when Self-Defense is disabled. Affected products are: ESET NOD32 Antivirus, ESET Internet Security, ESET Smart Security, ESET Smart Security Premium versions 13.2 and lower; ESET Endpoint Antivirus, ESET Endpoint Security, ESET NOD32 Antivirus Business Edition, ESET Smart Security Business Edition versions 7.3 and lower; ESET File Security for Microsoft Windows Server, ESET Mail Security for Microsoft Exchange Server, ESET Mail Security for IBM Domino, ESET Security for Kerio, ESET Security for Microsoft SharePoint Server versions 7.2 and lower.\n\n- CVE-2020-28910: Creation of a Temporary Directory with Insecure Permissions in Nagios XI 5.7.5 and earlier allows for Privilege Escalation via creation of symlinks, which are mishandled in getprofile.sh.\n\n- CVE-2020-26155: Multiple files and folders in Utimaco SecurityServer 4.20.0.4 and 4.31.1.0. are installed with Read/Write permissions for authenticated users, which allows for binaries to be manipulated by non-administrator users. Additionally, entries are made to the PATH environment variable which, in conjunction with these weak permissions, could enable an attacker to perform a DLL hijacking attack.\n\n- CVE-2021-22921: Node.js before 16.4.1, 14.17.2, and 12.22.2 is vulnerable to local privilege escalation attacks under certain conditions on Windows platforms. More specifically, improper configuration of permissions in the installation directory allows an attacker to perform two different escalation attacks: PATH and DLL hijacking.\n\n- CVE-2021-28098: An issue was discovered in Forescout CounterACT before 8.1.4. A local privilege escalation vulnerability is present in the logging function. SecureConnector runs with administrative privileges and writes logs entries to a file in %PROGRAMDATA%\\\\ForeScout SecureConnector\\\\ that has full permissions for the Everyone group. Using a symbolic link allows an attacker to point the log file to a privileged location such as %WINDIR%\\\\System32. The resulting log file adopts the file permissions of the source of the symbolic link (in this case, the Everyone group). The log file in System32 can be replaced and renamed with a malicious DLL for DLL hijacking.\n\n- CVE-2021-26434: Visual Studio Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-27070: Windows 10 Update Assistant Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-31167: Windows Container Manager Service Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-36934: <p>An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists because of overly permissive Access Control Lists (ACLs) on multiple system files, including the Security Accounts Manager (SAM) database. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p> <p>An attacker must have the ability to execute code on a victim system to exploit this vulnerability.</p> <p>After installing this security update, you <em>must</em> manually delete all shadow copies of system files, including the SAM database, to fully mitigate this vulnerabilty. <strong>Simply installing this security update will not fully mitigate this vulnerability.</strong> See <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/topic/1ceaa637-aaa3-4b58-a48b-baf72a2fa9e7\">KB5005357- Delete Volume Shadow Copies</a>.</p> \n\n- CVE-2020-5895: On NGINX Controller versions 3.1.0-3.3.0, AVRD uses world-readable and world-writable permissions on its socket, which allows processes or users on the local system to write arbitrary data into the socket. A local system attacker can make AVRD segmentation fault (SIGSEGV) by writing malformed messages to the socket.\n\n- CVE-2021-28269: Soyal Technology 701Client 9.0.1 is vulnerable to Insecure permissions via client.exe binary with Authenticated Users group with Full permissions.\n\n- CVE-2021-28374: The Debian courier-authlib package before 0.71.1-2 for Courier Authentication Library creates a /run/courier/authdaemon directory with weak permissions, allowing an attacker to read user information. This may include a cleartext password in some configurations. In general, it includes the user's existence, uid and gids, home and/or Maildir directory, quota, and some type of password information (such as a hash).\n\n- CVE-2021-32577: Acronis True Image prior to 2021 Update 5 for Windows allowed local privilege escalation due to insecure folder permissions.\n\n- CVE-2021-38085: The Canon TR150 print driver through 3.71.2.10 is vulnerable to a privilege escalation issue. During the add printer process, a local attacker can overwrite CNMurGE.dll and, if timed properly, the overwritten DLL will be loaded into a SYSTEM process resulting in escalation of privileges. This occurs because the driver drops a world-writable DLL into a CanonBJ %PROGRAMDATA% location that gets loaded by printisolationhost (a system process).\n\n- CVE-2021-38590: In cPanel before 96.0.8, weak permissions on web stats can lead to information disclosure (SEC-584).\n\n- CVE-2021-44512: World-writable permissions on the /tmp/tmate/sessions directory in tmate-ssh-server 2.3.0 allow a local attacker to compromise the integrity of session handling, or obtain the read-write session ID from a read-only session symlink in this directory.\n\n- CVE-2020-14263: \"HCL Traveler Companion is vulnerable to an iOS weak cryptographic process vulnerability via the included MobileIron AppConnect SDK\"\n\n- CVE-2020-27568: Insecure File Permissions exist in Aviatrix Controller 5.3.1516.

Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2007-0681:** Web app allows remote attackers to change the passwords of arbitrary users without providing the original password, and possibly perform other unauthorized actions.\n- **CVE-2000-0944:** Web application password change utility doesn't check the original password.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-307: Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not implement sufficient measures to prevent multiple failed authentication attempts within a short time frame.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-1390\nChildOf -> CWE-287\nChildOf -> CWE-799\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2019-0039:** the REST API for a network OS has a high limit for number of connections, allowing brute force password guessing\n- **CVE-1999-1152:** Product does not disconnect or timeout after multiple failed logins.\n- **CVE-2001-1291:** Product does not disconnect or timeout after multiple failed logins.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-285: Improper Authorization\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nAssuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.\n\n\nWhen access control checks are not applied consistently - or not at all - users are able to access data or perform actions that they should not be allowed to perform. This can lead to a wide range of problems, including information exposures, denial of service, and arbitrary code execution.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nAuthZ: \"AuthZ\" is typically used as an abbreviation of \"authorization\" within the web application security community. It is distinct from \"AuthN\" (or, sometimes, \"AuthC\") which is an abbreviation of \"authentication.\" The use of \"Auth\" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-284\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** CWE-285 is high-level and lower-level CWEs can frequently be used instead. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).\n**Comments:** Look at CWE-285's children and consider mapping to CWEs such as CWE-862: Missing Authorization, CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization, CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource, or others.\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n**Suggested Alternatives:**\n- CWE-862: Missing Authorization\n- CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\n- CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-24730:** Go-based continuous deployment product does not check that a user has certain privileges to update or create an app, allowing adversaries to read sensitive repository information\n- **CVE-2009-3168:** Web application does not restrict access to admin scripts, allowing authenticated users to reset administrative passwords.\n- **CVE-2009-2960:** Web application does not restrict access to admin scripts, allowing authenticated users to modify passwords of other users.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not perform any authentication for functionality that requires a provable user identity or consumes a significant amount of resources.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-287\nChildOf -> CWE-287\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

It is also distinct from \"AuthZ,\" which is an abbreviation of \"authorization.\" The use of \"Auth\" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.\nAuthC: \"AuthC\" is used as an abbreviation of \"authentication,\" but it appears to used less frequently than \"AuthN.\"\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-284\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry might be misused when lower-level CWE entries are likely to be applicable. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).\n**Comments:** Consider children or descendants, beginning with CWE-1390: Weak Authentication or CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function.\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n**Suggested Alternatives:**\n- CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n- CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This can be resultant from SQL injection vulnerabilities and other issues.\n\n**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the \"Mapping CWE to 62443\" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-35248:** Chat application skips validation when Central Authentication Service (CAS) is enabled, effectively removing the second factor from two-factor authentication\n- **CVE-2022-36436:** Python-based authentication proxy does not enforce password authentication during the initial handshake, allowing the client to bypass authentication by specifying a 'None' authentication type.\n- **CVE-2022-30034:** Chain: Web UI for a Python RPC framework does not use regex anchors to validate user login emails (CWE-777), potentially allowing bypass of OAuth (CWE-1390).\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product requires authentication, but the product has an alternate path or channel that does not require authentication.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-306\nChildOf -> CWE-284\nPeerOf -> CWE-420\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Research Gap]** These are probably under-studied in Windows and Mac environments, where file names are case-insensitive and thus are subject to equivalence manipulations involving case.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2000-0499:** Application server allows attackers to bypass execution of a jsp page and read the source code using an upper case JSP extension in the request.\n- **CVE-2000-0497:** The server is case sensitive, so filetype handlers treat .jsp and .JSP as different extensions. JSP source code may be read because .JSP defaults to the filetype \"text\".\n- **CVE-2000-0498:** The server is case sensitive, so filetype handlers treat .jsp and .JSP as different extensions. JSP source code may be read because .JSP defaults to the filetype \"text\".\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nAttackers may be able to bypass weak authentication faster and/or with less effort than expected.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-287\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-30034:** Chain: Web UI for a Python RPC framework does not use regex anchors to validate user login emails (CWE-777), potentially allowing bypass of OAuth (CWE-1390).\n- **CVE-2022-35248:** Chat application skips validation when Central Authentication Service (CAS) is enabled, effectively removing the second factor from two-factor authentication\n- **CVE-2021-3116:** Chain: Python-based HTTP Proxy server uses the wrong boolean operators (CWE-480) causing an incorrect comparison (CWE-697) that identifies an authN failure if all three conditions are met instead of only one, allowing bypass of the proxy authentication (CWE-1390)\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe use of a hard-coded cryptographic key significantly increases the possibility that encrypted data may be recovered.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-798\nChildOf -> CWE-798\nChildOf -> CWE-798\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Other]** The main difference between the use of hard-coded passwords and the use of hard-coded cryptographic keys is the false sense of security that the former conveys. Many people believe that simply hashing a hard-coded password before storage will protect the information from malicious users. However, many hashes are reversible (or at least vulnerable to brute force attacks) -- and further, many authentication protocols simply request the hash itself, making it no better than a password.\n\n**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the \"Mapping CWE to 62443\" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-29960:** Engineering Workstation uses hard-coded cryptographic keys that could allow for unathorized filesystem access and privilege escalation\n- **CVE-2022-30271:** Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) uses a hard-coded SSH private key that is likely to be used by default.\n- **CVE-2020-10884:** WiFi router service has a hard-coded encryption key, allowing root access\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product contains a hard-coded password, which it uses for its own inbound authentication or for outbound communication to external components.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nA hard-coded password typically leads to a significant authentication failure that can be difficult for the system administrator to detect. Once detected, it can be difficult to fix, so the administrator may be forced into disabling the product entirely. There are two main variations:\n\n```\n\t\tInbound: the product contains an authentication mechanism that checks for a hard-coded password.\n\t\tOutbound: the product connects to another system or component, and it contains hard-coded password for connecting to that component.\n```\nIn the Inbound variant, a default administration account is created, and a simple password is hard-coded into the product and associated with that account. This hard-coded password is the same for each installation of the product, and it usually cannot be changed or disabled by system administrators without manually modifying the program, or otherwise patching the product. If the password is ever discovered or published (a common occurrence on the Internet), then anybody with knowledge of this password can access the product. Finally, since all installations of the product will have the same password, even across different organizations, this enables massive attacks such as worms to take place.\n\nThe Outbound variant applies to front-end systems that authenticate with a back-end service. The back-end service may require a fixed password which can be easily discovered. The programmer may simply hard-code those back-end credentials into the front-end product. Any user of that program may be able to extract the password. Client-side systems with hard-coded passwords pose even more of a threat, since the extraction of a password from a binary is usually very simple.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-798\nChildOf -> CWE-798\nChildOf -> CWE-798\nPeerOf -> CWE-321\nPeerOf -> CWE-257\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** This entry could be split into multiple variants: an inbound variant (as seen in the second demonstrative example) and an outbound variant (as seen in the first demonstrative example). These variants are likely to have different consequences, detectability, etc. More importantly, from a vulnerability theory perspective, they could be characterized as different behaviors.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-29964:** Distributed Control System (DCS) has hard-coded passwords for local shell access\n- **CVE-2021-37555:** Telnet service for IoT feeder for dogs and cats has hard-coded password [REF-1288]\n- **CVE-2021-35033:** Firmware for a WiFi router uses a hard-coded password for a BusyBox shell, allowing bypass of authentication through the UART port\n\n",

Such issue could be chained with an open redirect (CVE-2021-24358) in version below 4.1.10, to include a crafted password reset link in the email, which would lead to an account takeover.\n\n- CVE-2021-34785: Multiple vulnerabilities in Cisco BroadWorks CommPilot Application Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to delete arbitrary user accounts or gain elevated privileges on an affected system.\n\n- CVE-2021-34786: Multiple vulnerabilities in Cisco BroadWorks CommPilot Application Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to delete arbitrary user accounts or gain elevated privileges on an affected system.\n\n- CVE-2020-16839: On Crestron DM-NVX-DIR, DM-NVX-DIR80, and DM-NVX-ENT devices before the DM-XIO/1-0-3-802 patch, the password can be changed by sending an unauthenticated WebSocket request.\n\n- CVE-2021-40101: An issue was discovered in Concrete CMS before 8.5.7. The Dashboard allows a user's password to be changed without a prompt for the current password.\n\n- CVE-2020-20466: White Shark System (WSS) 1.3.2 is vulnerable to unauthorized access via user_edit_password.php, remote attackers can modify the password of any user.\n\n- CVE-2021-34977: This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to bypass authentication on affected installations of NETGEAR R7000 1.0.11.116_10.2.100 routers. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the processing of SOAP requests. The issue results from the lack of proper authentication verification before performing a password reset. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to reset the admin password. Was ZDI-CAN-13483.\n\n- CVE-2021-44152: An issue was discovered in Reprise RLM 14.2. Because /goform/change_password_process does not verify authentication or authorization, an unauthenticated user can change the password of any existing user. This allows an attacker to change the password of any known user, thereby preventing valid users from accessing the system and granting the attacker full access to that user's account.\n\n- CVE-2021-29394: Account Hijacking in /northstar/Admin/changePassword.jsp in Northstar Technologies Inc NorthStar Club Management 6.3 allows remote authenticated users to change the password of any targeted user accounts via lack of proper authorization in the user-controlled \"userID\" parameter of the HTTP POST request.\n\n- CVE-2022-21935: A vulnerability in Metasys ADS/ADX/OAS 10 versions prior to 10.1.5 and Metasys ADS/ADX/OAS 11 versions prior to 11.0.2 allows unverified password change.\n\n- CVE-2022-27484: A unverified password change in Fortinet FortiADC version 6.2.0 through 6.2.3, 6.1.x, 6.0.x, 5.x.x allows an authenticated attacker to bypass the Old Password check in the password change form via a crafted HTTP request.\n\n- CVE-2022-3152: Unverified Password Change in GitHub repository phpfusion/phpfusion prior to 9.10.20.\n\n- CVE-2022-21934: Under certain circumstances an authenticated user could lock other users out of the system or take over their accounts in Metasys ADS/ADX/OAS server 10 versions prior to 10.1.5 and Metasys ADS/ADX/OAS server 11 versions prior to 11.0.2.\n\n- CVE-2022-24551: A flaw was found in StarWind Stack. The endpoint for setting a new password doesn\u2019t check the current username and old password. An attacker could reset any local user password (including system/administrator user) using any available user This affects StarWind SAN and NAS v0.2 build 1633.\n\n- CVE-2022-0862: A lack of password change protection vulnerability in a depreciated API of McAfee Enterprise ePolicy Orchestrator (ePO) prior to 5.10 Update 13 allows a remote attacker to change the password of a compromised session without knowing the existing user's password. This functionality was removed from the User Interface in ePO 10 and the API has now been disabled.

IBM X-Force ID: 196217.\n\n- CVE-2021-25309: The telnet administrator service running on port 650 on Gigaset DX600A v41.00-175 devices does not implement any lockout or throttling functionality. This situation (together with the weak password policy that forces a 4-digit password) allows remote attackers to easily obtain administrative access via brute-force attacks.\n\n- CVE-2022-3993: Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts in GitHub repository kareadita/kavita prior to 0.6.0.3. \n\n- CVE-2022-22485: In some cases, an unsuccessful attempt to log into IBM Spectrum Protect Operations Center 8.1.0.000 through 8.1.14.000 does not cause the administrator's invalid sign-on count to be incremented on the IBM Spectrum Protect Server. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using brute force techniques to gain unauthorized administrative access to the IBM Spectrum Protect Server. IBM X-Force ID: 226325.\n\n- CVE-2022-22487: An IBM Spectrum Protect storage agent could allow a remote attacker to perform a brute force attack by allowing unlimited attempts to login to the storage agent without locking the administrative ID. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using brute force techniques to gain unauthorized administrative access to both the IBM Spectrum Protect storage agent and the IBM Spectrum Protect Server 8.1.0.000 through 8.1.14 with which it communicates. IBM X-Force ID: 226326.\n\n- CVE-2022-35925: BookWyrm is a social network for tracking reading. Versions prior to 0.4.5 were found to lack rate limiting on authentication views which allows brute-force attacks. This issue has been patched in version 0.4.5. Admins with existing instances will need to update their `nginx.conf` file that was created when the instance was set up. Users are advised advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may update their nginx.conf files with the changes manually.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-1390 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-287 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-799 (ChildOf)",

Due to a bug in ASF code `POST /Api/ASF` ASF API endpoint responsible for updating global ASF config incorrectly removed `IPCPassword` from the resulting config when the caller did not specify it explicitly. Due to the above, it was possible for the user to accidentally remove `IPCPassword` security measure from his IPC interface when updating global ASF config, which exists as part of global config update functionality in ASF-ui. Removal of `IPCPassword` possesses a security risk, as unauthorized users may in result access the IPC interface after such modification. The issue is patched in ASF V5.1.2.4 and future versions. We recommend to manually verify that `IPCPassword` is specified after update, and if not, set it accordingly. In default settings, ASF is configured to allow IPC access from `localhost` only and should not affect majority of users.\n\n- CVE-2021-3282: HashiCorp Vault Enterprise 1.6.0 & 1.6.1 allowed the `remove-peer` raft operator command to be executed against DR secondaries without authentication.

Prior to version 1.10.7, FreeSWITCH does not authenticate SIP MESSAGE requests, leading to spam and message spoofing. By default, SIP requests of the type MESSAGE (RFC 3428) are not authenticated in the affected versions of FreeSWITCH. MESSAGE requests are relayed to SIP user agents registered with the FreeSWITCH server without requiring any authentication. Although this behaviour can be changed by setting the `auth-messages` parameter to `true`, it is not the default setting. Abuse of this security issue allows attackers to send SIP MESSAGE messages to any SIP user agent that is registered with the server without requiring authentication. Additionally, since no authentication is required, chat messages can be spoofed to appear to come from trusted entities. Therefore, abuse can lead to spam and enable social engineering, phishing and similar attacks. This issue is patched in version 1.10.7. Maintainers recommend that this SIP message type is authenticated by default so that FreeSWITCH administrators do not need to be explicitly set the `auth-messages` parameter. When following such a recommendation, a new parameter can be introduced to explicitly disable authentication.\n\n- CVE-2021-38412: Properly formatted POST requests to multiple resources on the HTTP and HTTPS web servers of the Digi PortServer TS 16 Rack device do not require authentication or authentication tokens.

By default, SIP requests of the type SUBSCRIBE are not authenticated in the affected versions of FreeSWITCH. Abuse of this security issue allows attackers to subscribe to user agent event notifications without the need to authenticate. This abuse poses privacy concerns and might lead to social engineering or similar attacks. For example, attackers may be able to monitor the status of target SIP extensions. Although this issue was fixed in version v1.10.6, installations upgraded to the fixed version of FreeSWITCH from an older version, may still be vulnerable if the configuration is not updated accordingly. Software upgrades do not update the configuration by default. SIP SUBSCRIBE messages should be authenticated by default so that FreeSWITCH administrators do not need to explicitly set the `auth-subscriptions` parameter. When following such a recommendation, a new parameter can be introduced to explicitly disable authentication.\n\n- CVE-2020-25566: In SapphireIMS 5.0, it is possible to take over an account by sending a request to the Save_Password form as shown in POC.

A malicious user can modify the contents of a `confirmation_token` input during the two-factor authentication process to reference a cache value not associated with the login attempt. In rare cases this can allow a malicious actor to authenticate as a random user in the Panel. The malicious user must target an account with two-factor authentication enabled, and then must provide a correct two-factor authentication token before being authenticated as that user. Due to a validation flaw in the logic handling user authentication during the two-factor authentication process a malicious user can trick the system into loading credentials for an arbitrary user by modifying the token sent to the server. This authentication flaw is present in the `LoginCheckpointController@__invoke` method which handles two-factor authentication for a user. This controller looks for a request input parameter called `confirmation_token` which is expected to be a 64 character random alpha-numeric string that references a value within the Panel's cache containing a `user_id` value. This value is then used to fetch the user that attempted to login, and lookup their two-factor authentication token. Due to the design of this system, any element in the cache that contains only digits could be referenced by a malicious user, and whatever value is stored at that position would be used as the `user_id`. There are a few different areas of the Panel that store values into the cache that are integers, and a user who determines what those cache keys are could pass one of those keys which would cause this code pathway to reference an arbitrary user. At its heart this is a high-risk login bypass vulnerability. However, there are a few additional conditions that must be met in order for this to be successfully executed, notably: 1.) The account referenced by the malicious cache key must have two-factor authentication enabled. An account without two-factor authentication would cause an exception to be triggered by the authentication logic, thusly exiting this authentication flow. 2.) Even if the malicious user is able to reference a valid cache key that references a valid user account with two-factor authentication, they must provide a valid two-factor authentication token. However, due to the design of this endpoint once a valid user account is found with two-factor authentication enabled there is no rate-limiting present, thusly allowing an attacker to brute force combinations until successful. This leads to a third condition that must be met: 3.) For the duration of this attack sequence the cache key being referenced must continue to exist with a valid `user_id` value. Depending on the specific key being used for this attack, this value may disappear quickly, or be changed by other random user interactions on the Panel, outside the control of the attacker. In order to mitigate this vulnerability the underlying authentication logic was changed to use an encrypted session store that the user is therefore unable to control the value of. This completely removed the use of a user-controlled value being used. In addition, the code was audited to ensure this type of vulnerability is not present elsewhere.\n\n- CVE-2021-42338: 4MOSAn GCB Doctor\u2019s login page has improper validation of Cookie, which allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to bypass authentication by code injection in cookie, and arbitrarily manipulate the system or interrupt services by upload and execution of arbitrary files.\n\n- CVE-2021-1541: Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business 220 Series Smart Switches could allow an attacker to do the following: Hijack a user session Execute arbitrary commands as a root user on the underlying operating system Conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack Conduct an HTML injection attack For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2021-41317: XSS Hunter Express before 2021-09-17 does not properly enforce authentication requirements for paths.\n\n- CVE-2021-29012: DMA Softlab Radius Manager 4.4.0 assigns the same session cookie to every admin session.

This affects users of spnego-http-auth-nginx-module that have enabled basic authentication. This is fixed in version 1.1.1 of spnego-http-auth-nginx-module. As a workaround, one may disable basic authentication.\n\n- CVE-2021-21378: Envoy is a cloud-native high-performance edge/middle/service proxy. In Envoy version 1.17.0 an attacker can bypass authentication by presenting a JWT token with an issuer that is not in the provider list when Envoy's JWT Authentication filter is configured with the `allow_missing` requirement under `requires_any` due to a mistake in implementation. Envoy's JWT Authentication filter can be configured with the `allow_missing` requirement that will be satisfied if JWT is missing (JwtMissed error) and fail if JWT is presented or invalid. Due to a mistake in implementation, a JwtUnknownIssuer error was mistakenly converted to JwtMissed when `requires_any` was configured. So if `allow_missing` was configured under `requires_any`, an attacker can bypass authentication by presenting a JWT token with an issuer that is not in the provider list. Integrity may be impacted depending on configuration if the JWT token is used to protect against writes or modifications. This regression was introduced on 2020/11/12 in PR 13839 which fixed handling `allow_missing` under RequiresAny in a JwtRequirement (see issue 13458). The AnyVerifier aggregates the children verifiers' results into a final status where JwtMissing is the default error. However, a JwtUnknownIssuer was mistakenly treated the same as a JwtMissing error and the resulting final aggregation was the default JwtMissing. As a result, `allow_missing` would allow a JWT token with an unknown issuer status. This is fixed in version 1.17.1 by PR 15194. The fix works by preferring JwtUnknownIssuer over a JwtMissing error, fixing the accidental conversion and bypass with `allow_missing`. A user could detect whether a bypass occurred if they have Envoy logs enabled with debug verbosity. Users can enable component level debug logs for JWT. The JWT filter logs will indicate that there is a request with a JWT token and a failure that the JWT token is missing.\n\n- CVE-2021-21513: Dell EMC OpenManage Server Administrator (OMSA) version 9.5 Microsoft Windows installations with Distributed Web Server (DWS) enabled configuration contains an authentication bypass vulnerability.

In versions prior to 8.7.49, 9.5.38, 10.4.33, 11.5.20, and 12.1.1 TYPO3 is vulnerable to Improper Authentication. Restricting frontend login to specific users, organized in different storage folders (partitions), can be bypassed. A potential attacker might use this ambiguity in usernames to get access to a different account - however, credentials must be known to the adversary. This issue is patched in versions 8.7.49 ELTS, 9.5.38 ELTS, 10.4.33, 11.5.20, 12.1.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-23600: fleet is an open source device management, built on osquery. Versions prior to 4.9.1 expose a limited ability to spoof SAML authentication with missing audience verification. This impacts deployments using SAML SSO in two specific cases: 1. A malicious or compromised Service Provider (SP) could reuse the SAML response to log into Fleet as a user -- only if the user has an account with the same email in Fleet, _and_ the user signs into the malicious SP via SAML SSO from the same Identity Provider (IdP) configured with Fleet. 2. A user with an account in Fleet could reuse a SAML response intended for another SP to log into Fleet. This is only a concern if the user is blocked from Fleet in the IdP, but continues to have an account in Fleet. If the user is blocked from the IdP entirely, this cannot be exploited. Fleet 4.9.1 resolves this issue. Users unable to upgrade should: Reduce the length of sessions on your IdP to reduce the window for malicious re-use, Limit the amount of SAML Service Providers/Applications used by user accounts with access to Fleet, and When removing access to Fleet in the IdP, delete the Fleet user from Fleet as well.\n\n- CVE-2022-24259: An incorrect check in the component cdr.php of Voipmonitor GUI before v24.96 allows unauthenticated attackers to escalate privileges via a crafted request.\n\n- CVE-2022-24883: FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). Prior to version 2.7.0, server side authentication against a `SAM` file might be successful for invalid credentials if the server has configured an invalid `SAM` file path. FreeRDP based clients are not affected. RDP server implementations using FreeRDP to authenticate against a `SAM` file are affected. Version 2.7.0 contains a fix for this issue. As a workaround, use custom authentication via `HashCallback` and/or ensure the `SAM` database path configured is valid and the application has file handles left.\n\n- CVE-2022-24885: Nextcloud Android app is the Android client for Nextcloud, a self-hosted productivity platform. Prior to version 3.19.1, users can bypass a lock on the Nextcloud app on an Android device by repeatedly reopening the app. Version 3.19.1 contains a fix for the problem. There are currently no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-24976: Atheme IRC Services before 7.2.12, when used in conjunction with InspIRCd, allows authentication bypass by ending an IRC handshake at a certain point during a challenge-response login sequence.\n\n- CVE-2022-2533: An issue has been discovered in GitLab affecting all versions starting from 12.10 before 15.1.6, all versions starting from 15.2 before 15.2.4, all versions starting from 15.3 before 15.3.2.

In versions prior to 2.4.3, when using Portable Authentication Modules (PAM) for user authentication, if a user presented valid credentials but the account is disabled or otherwise not allowed to access the host (such as an expired password), it would still be accepted for access to Arvados. Other authentication methods (LDAP, OpenID Connect) supported by Arvados are not affected by this flaw. This issue is patched in version 2.4.3. Workaround for this issue is to migrate to a different authentication method supported by Arvados, such as LDAP.\n\n- CVE-2022-39263: `@next-auth/upstash-redis-adapter` is the Upstash Redis adapter for NextAuth.js, which provides authentication for Next.js. Applications that use `next-auth` Email Provider and `@next-auth/upstash-redis-adapter` before v3.0.2 are affected by this vulnerability. The Upstash Redis adapter implementation did not check for both the identifier (email) and the token, but only checking for the identifier when verifying the token in the email callback flow. An attacker who knows about the victim's email could easily sign in as the victim, given the attacker also knows about the verification token's expired duration. The vulnerability is patched in v3.0.2. A workaround is available. Using Advanced Initialization, developers can check the requests and compare the query's token and identifier before proceeding.\n\n- CVE-2022-39355: Discourse Patreon enables syncronization between Discourse Groups and Patreon rewards.

This vulnerability is patched in commit number 846d012151514b35ce42a1636c7d70f6dcee879e of the discourse-patreon plugin. Out of an abundance of caution, any Discourse accounts which have logged in with an unverified-email Patreon account will be logged out and asked to verify their email address on their next login. As a workaround, disable the patreon integration and log out all users with associated Patreon accounts.\n\n- CVE-2021-3632: A flaw was found in Keycloak. This vulnerability allows anyone to register a new security device or key when there is not a device already registered for any user by using the WebAuthn password-less login flow.\n\n- CVE-2022-46170: CodeIgniter is a PHP full-stack web framework. When an application uses (1) multiple session cookies (e.g., one for user pages and one for admin pages) and (2) a session handler is set to `DatabaseHandler`, `MemcachedHandler`, or `RedisHandler`, then if an attacker gets one session cookie (e.g., one for user pages), they may be able to access pages that require another session cookie (e.g., for admin pages). This issue has been patched, please upgrade to version 4.2.11 or later. As a workaround, use only one session cookie.\n\n- CVE-2022-46316: A thread security vulnerability exists in the authentication process.

Versions prior to 2.7.13 in `stable`, 2.8.0.beta11 in `beta`, and 2.8.0.beta11 in `tests-passed` allow some users to log in to a community before they should be able to do so. A user invited via email to a forum with `must_approve_users` enabled is going to be automatically logged in, bypassing the check that does not allow unapproved users to sign in. They will be able to do everything an approved user can do. If they logout, they cannot log back in. This issue is patched in the `stable` version 2.7.13, `beta` version 2.8.0.beta11, and `tests-passed` version 2.8.0.beta11. One may disable invites as a workaround.

It mishandles software updates such that local third-party apps can provide a spoofed software update file that contains an arbitrary shell script and arbitrary ARM binary, where both will be executed as the root user with an SELinux domain named osi. To exploit this vulnerability, a local third-party app needs to have write access to external storage to write the spoofed update at the expected path. The vulnerable system binary (i.e., /system/bin/osi_bin) does not perform any authentication of the update file beyond ensuring that it is encrypted with an AES key (that is hard-coded in the vulnerable system binary). Processes executing with the osi SELinux domain can programmatically perform the following actions: install apps, grant runtime permissions to apps (including permissions with protection levels of dangerous and development), access extensive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) using the programmatically grant permissions, uninstall apps, set the default launcher app to a malicious launcher app that spoofs other apps, set a network proxy to intercept network traffic, unload kernel modules, set the default keyboard to a keyboard that has keylogging functionality, examine notification contents, send text messages, and more. The spoofed update can optionally contain an arbitrary ARM binary that will be locally stored in internal storage and executed at system startup to achieve persistent code execution as the root user with the osi SELinux domain. This ARM binary will continue to execute at startup even if the app that provided the spoofed update is uninstalled.\n\n- CVE-2020-7352: The GalaxyClientService component of GOG Galaxy runs with elevated SYSTEM privileges in a Windows environment.

There are two main variations:\n\n```\n\t\tInbound: the product contains an authentication mechanism that checks for a hard-coded password.\n\t\tOutbound: the product connects to another system or component, and it contains hard-coded password for connecting to that component.\n```\nIn the Inbound variant, a default administration account is created, and a simple password is hard-coded into the product and associated with that account. This hard-coded password is the same for each installation of the product, and it usually cannot be changed or disabled by system administrators without manually modifying the program, or otherwise patching the product. If the password is ever discovered or published (a common occurrence on the Internet), then anybody with knowledge of this password can access the product. Finally, since all installations of the product will have the same password, even across different organizations, this enables massive attacks such as worms to take place.\n\nThe Outbound variant applies to front-end systems that authenticate with a back-end service. The back-end service may require a fixed password which can be easily discovered. The programmer may simply hard-code those back-end credentials into the front-end product. Any user of that program may be able to extract the password. Client-side systems with hard-coded passwords pose even more of a threat, since the extraction of a password from a binary is usually very simple.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-29964: Distributed Control System (DCS) has hard-coded passwords for local shell access\n\n- CVE-2021-37555: Telnet service for IoT feeder for dogs and cats has hard-coded password [REF-1288]\n\n- CVE-2021-35033: Firmware for a WiFi router uses a hard-coded password for a BusyBox shell, allowing bypass of authentication through the UART port\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-27438: The software contains a hard-coded password it uses for its own inbound authentication or for outbound communication to external components on the Reason DR60 (all firmware versions prior to 02A04.1).\n\n- CVE-2021-34757: Multiple vulnerabilities in Cisco Business 220 Series Smart Switches firmware could allow an attacker with Administrator privileges to access sensitive login credentials or reconfigure the passwords on the user account.

In affected versions envoy incorrectly handled a URI '#fragment' element as part of the path element. Envoy is configured with an RBAC filter for authorization or similar mechanism with an explicit case of a final \"/admin\" path element, or is using a negative assertion with final path element of \"/admin\". The client sends request to \"/app1/admin#foo\". In Envoy prior to 1.18.0, or 1.18.0+ configured with path_normalization=false. Envoy treats fragment as a suffix of the query string when present, or as a suffix of the path when query string is absent, so it evaluates the final path element as \"/admin#foo\" and mismatches with the configured \"/admin\" path element. In Envoy 1.18.0+ configured with path_normalization=true. Envoy transforms this to /app1/admin%23foo and mismatches with the configured /admin prefix. The resulting URI is sent to the next server-agent with the offending \"#foo\" fragment which violates RFC3986 or with the nonsensical \"%23foo\" text appended. A specifically constructed request with URI containing '#fragment' element delivered by an untrusted client in the presence of path based request authorization resulting in escalation of Privileges when path based request authorization extensions.

The CWE usage of \"access control\" is intended as a general term for the various mechanisms that restrict which users can access which resources, and \"authorization\" is more narrowly defined. It is unlikely that there will be community consensus on the use of these terms.\n\nDescription:\n\nThe product does not restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor.\n\nExtended Details:\n\n\n\nAccess control involves the use of several protection mechanisms such as:\n\n\n  - Authentication (proving the identity of an actor)\n\n  - Authorization (ensuring that a given actor can access a resource), and\n\n  - Accountability (tracking of activities that were performed)\n\nWhen any mechanism is not applied or otherwise fails, attackers can compromise the security of the product by gaining privileges, reading sensitive information, executing commands, evading detection, etc.\n\nThere are two distinct behaviors that can introduce access control weaknesses:\n\n\n  - Specification: incorrect privileges, permissions, ownership, etc. are explicitly specified for either the user or the resource (for example, setting a password file to be world-writable, or giving administrator capabilities to a guest user).

This is especially dangerous when the resource is related to program configuration, execution, or sensitive user data. For example, consider a misconfigured storage account for the cloud that can be read or written by a public or anonymous user.\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-29527: Go application for cloud management creates a world-writable sudoers file that allows local attackers to inject sudo rules and escalate privileges to root by winning a race condition.\n\n- CVE-2009-3482: Anti-virus product sets insecure \"Everyone: Full Control\" permissions for files under the \"Program Files\" folder, allowing attackers to replace executables with Trojan horses.\n\n- CVE-2009-3897: Product creates directories with 0777 permissions at installation, allowing users to gain privileges and access a socket used for authentication.\n\n- CVE-2009-3489: Photo editor installs a service with an insecure security descriptor, allowing users to stop or start the service, or execute commands as SYSTEM.\n\n- CVE-2020-15708: socket created with insecure permissions\n\n- CVE-2009-3289: Library function copies a file to a new target and uses the source file's permissions for the target, which is incorrect when the source file is a symbolic link, which typically has 0777 permissions.\n\n- CVE-2009-0115: Device driver uses world-writable permissions for a socket file, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary commands.\n\n- CVE-2009-1073: LDAP server stores a cleartext password in a world-readable file.\n\n- CVE-2009-0141: Terminal emulator creates TTY devices with world-writable permissions, allowing an attacker to write to the terminals of other users.\n\n- CVE-2008-0662: VPN product stores user credentials in a registry key with \"Everyone: Full Control\" permissions, allowing attackers to steal the credentials.\n\n- CVE-2008-0322: Driver installs its device interface with \"Everyone: Write\" permissions.\n\n- CVE-2009-3939: Driver installs a file with world-writable permissions.\n\n- CVE-2009-3611: Product changes permissions to 0777 before deleting a backup; the permissions stay insecure for subsequent backups.\n\n- CVE-2007-6033: Product creates a share with \"Everyone: Full Control\" permissions, allowing arbitrary program execution.\n\n- CVE-2007-5544: Product uses \"Everyone: Full Control\" permissions for memory-mapped files (shared memory) in inter-process communication, allowing attackers to tamper with a session.\n\n- CVE-2005-4868: Database product uses read/write permissions for everyone for its shared memory, allowing theft of credentials.\n\n- CVE-2004-1714: Security product uses \"Everyone: Full Control\" permissions for its configuration files.\n\n- CVE-2001-0006: \"Everyone: Full Control\" permissions assigned to a mutex allows users to disable network connectivity.\n\n- CVE-2002-0969: Chain: database product contains buffer overflow that is only reachable through a .ini configuration file - which has \"Everyone: Full Control\" permissions.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-26941: A local (authenticated) low-privileged user can exploit a behavior in an ESET installer to achieve arbitrary file overwrite (deletion) of any file via a symlink, due to insecure permissions. The possibility of exploiting this vulnerability is limited and can only take place during the installation phase of ESET products. Furthermore, exploitation can only succeed when Self-Defense is disabled. Affected products are: ESET NOD32 Antivirus, ESET Internet Security, ESET Smart Security, ESET Smart Security Premium versions 13.2 and lower; ESET Endpoint Antivirus, ESET Endpoint Security, ESET NOD32 Antivirus Business Edition, ESET Smart Security Business Edition versions 7.3 and lower; ESET File Security for Microsoft Windows Server, ESET Mail Security for Microsoft Exchange Server, ESET Mail Security for IBM Domino, ESET Security for Kerio, ESET Security for Microsoft SharePoint Server versions 7.2 and lower.\n\n- CVE-2020-28910: Creation of a Temporary Directory with Insecure Permissions in Nagios XI 5.7.5 and earlier allows for Privilege Escalation via creation of symlinks, which are mishandled in getprofile.sh.\n\n- CVE-2020-26155: Multiple files and folders in Utimaco SecurityServer 4.20.0.4 and 4.31.1.0. are installed with Read/Write permissions for authenticated users, which allows for binaries to be manipulated by non-administrator users. Additionally, entries are made to the PATH environment variable which, in conjunction with these weak permissions, could enable an attacker to perform a DLL hijacking attack.\n\n- CVE-2021-22921: Node.js before 16.4.1, 14.17.2, and 12.22.2 is vulnerable to local privilege escalation attacks under certain conditions on Windows platforms. More specifically, improper configuration of permissions in the installation directory allows an attacker to perform two different escalation attacks: PATH and DLL hijacking.\n\n- CVE-2021-28098: An issue was discovered in Forescout CounterACT before 8.1.4. A local privilege escalation vulnerability is present in the logging function. SecureConnector runs with administrative privileges and writes logs entries to a file in %PROGRAMDATA%\\\\ForeScout SecureConnector\\\\ that has full permissions for the Everyone group. Using a symbolic link allows an attacker to point the log file to a privileged location such as %WINDIR%\\\\System32. The resulting log file adopts the file permissions of the source of the symbolic link (in this case, the Everyone group). The log file in System32 can be replaced and renamed with a malicious DLL for DLL hijacking.\n\n- CVE-2021-26434: Visual Studio Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-27070: Windows 10 Update Assistant Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-31167: Windows Container Manager Service Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-36934: <p>An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists because of overly permissive Access Control Lists (ACLs) on multiple system files, including the Security Accounts Manager (SAM) database. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p> <p>An attacker must have the ability to execute code on a victim system to exploit this vulnerability.</p> <p>After installing this security update, you <em>must</em> manually delete all shadow copies of system files, including the SAM database, to fully mitigate this vulnerabilty. <strong>Simply installing this security update will not fully mitigate this vulnerability.</strong> See <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/topic/1ceaa637-aaa3-4b58-a48b-baf72a2fa9e7\">KB5005357- Delete Volume Shadow Copies</a>.</p> \n\n- CVE-2020-5895: On NGINX Controller versions 3.1.0-3.3.0, AVRD uses world-readable and world-writable permissions on its socket, which allows processes or users on the local system to write arbitrary data into the socket. A local system attacker can make AVRD segmentation fault (SIGSEGV) by writing malformed messages to the socket.\n\n- CVE-2021-28269: Soyal Technology 701Client 9.0.1 is vulnerable to Insecure permissions via client.exe binary with Authenticated Users group with Full permissions.\n\n- CVE-2021-28374: The Debian courier-authlib package before 0.71.1-2 for Courier Authentication Library creates a /run/courier/authdaemon directory with weak permissions, allowing an attacker to read user information. This may include a cleartext password in some configurations. In general, it includes the user's existence, uid and gids, home and/or Maildir directory, quota, and some type of password information (such as a hash).\n\n- CVE-2021-32577: Acronis True Image prior to 2021 Update 5 for Windows allowed local privilege escalation due to insecure folder permissions.\n\n- CVE-2021-38085: The Canon TR150 print driver through 3.71.2.10 is vulnerable to a privilege escalation issue. During the add printer process, a local attacker can overwrite CNMurGE.dll and, if timed properly, the overwritten DLL will be loaded into a SYSTEM process resulting in escalation of privileges. This occurs because the driver drops a world-writable DLL into a CanonBJ %PROGRAMDATA% location that gets loaded by printisolationhost (a system process).\n\n- CVE-2021-38590: In cPanel before 96.0.8, weak permissions on web stats can lead to information disclosure (SEC-584).\n\n- CVE-2021-44512: World-writable permissions on the /tmp/tmate/sessions directory in tmate-ssh-server 2.3.0 allow a local attacker to compromise the integrity of session handling, or obtain the read-write session ID from a read-only session symlink in this directory.\n\n- CVE-2020-14263: \"HCL Traveler Companion is vulnerable to an iOS weak cryptographic process vulnerability via the included MobileIron AppConnect SDK\"\n\n- CVE-2020-27568: Insecure File Permissions exist in Aviatrix Controller 5.3.1516.
