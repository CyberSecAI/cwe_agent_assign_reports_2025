## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability has been found in liujianview gymxmjpa 1.0 and classified as critical. This vulnerability affects the function CoachController of the file src/main/java/com/liujian/gymxmjpa/controller/CoachController.java. The manipulation of the argument coachName leads to **sql injection**. The attack can be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **sql injection**
- **product:** liujianview gymxmjpa
- **version:** 1
- **component:** CoachController

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
**CVE-2025-0404 - PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval**

The provided content is **RELEVANT** and details a SQL injection vulnerability. Here's an extraction of the information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `count` method in `src/main/java/com/liujian/gymxmjpa/controller/CoachController.java` does not filter the `coachName` parameter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
SQL Injection

**Impact of exploitation:**
The vulnerability allows for blind SQL injection, potentially leading to data leakage or modification. The attacker can determine the database name (identified as "gym" in the provided examples).

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability is exploitable via HTTP requests to the `/coach/count` endpoint, manipulating the `coachName` parameter with SQL injection payloads.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application.  The provided examples show successful exploitation without authentication, suggesting it may be publicly accessible.

**Mitigation or fix:**
The content does not provide a specific fix, but implies that proper input validation and sanitization of the `coachName` parameter in the `count` method is required to prevent SQL injection.

**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**
*   The attacker demonstrates how to determine the length of the database name and then extract characters from it using `substr()`.
*   The attacker provides example payloads used to exploit the vulnerability.
*   The attacker was able to determine the database name is "gym".
*   The attacker provides login credentials (admin/admin123) which may be a default or compromised account.
