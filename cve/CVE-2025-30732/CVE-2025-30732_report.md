# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2025-30732

## Description

Vulnerability in the Oracle Application Object Library product of Oracle E-Business Suite (component Core). Supported versions that are affected are 12.2.3-12.2.14. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise Oracle Application Object Library. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Oracle Application Object Library, attacks may significantly impact additional products (scope change). Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Oracle Application Object Library accessible data as well as unauthorized read access to a subset of Oracle Application Object Library accessible data. CVSS 3.1 Base Score 6.1 (Confidentiality and Integrity impacts). CVSS Vector (CVSS3.1/AVN/ACL/PRN/UIR/SC/CL/IL/AN).

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | 0.8 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE: The vulnerability is due to a lack of authentication for critical functions, allowing unauthorized access. |
| CWE-200 | Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor | 0.6 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary Candidate: The vulnerability results in unauthorized read access to sensitive data. |
| CWE-269 | Improper Privilege Management | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate: The vulnerability results in unauthorized update, insert or delete access to data. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-306, which represents the **missing authentication**. CWE-200 and CWE-269 are potential impacts of this **missing authentication**, leading to information exposure and privilege escalation, respectively. CWE-306 is the root cause, with CWE-200 and CWE-269 as potential consequences.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **missing authentication** (CWE-306), leading to unauthorized access. This unauthorized access results in both unauthorized read access (CWE-200) and unauthorized update/insert/delete access (CWE-269).

## Summary of Analysis
The primary weakness is the **missing authentication** for critical functions (CWE-306), which allows an unauthenticated attacker to compromise the system. The vulnerability description clearly states an "unauthenticated attacker" can "compromise Oracle Application Object Library." The impacts include unauthorized read access (CWE-200) and unauthorized update, insert, or delete access (CWE-269).

CWE-306 is selected as the primary CWE because it represents the root cause of the vulnerability - the lack of authentication. The other CWEs are consequences of this initial weakness.

CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) was considered because the vulnerability description mentions "unauthorized read access." However, CWE-200 is a high-level class, and it's more appropriate to focus on the root cause (CWE-306). Moreover, the mapping guidance for CWE-200 discourages its use as a root cause.

CWE-269 (Improper Privilege Management) was considered because the vulnerability description mentions "unauthorized update, insert or delete access." This suggests a privilege escalation issue. The retriever did not specifically recommend this one.

The selection of CWE-306 is at the Base level, which is the preferred level of abstraction. The evidence supports this selection, as the vulnerability is directly caused by the absence of authentication for critical functions.
