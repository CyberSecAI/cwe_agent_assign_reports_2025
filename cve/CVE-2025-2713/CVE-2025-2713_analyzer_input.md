# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-2713

## Vulnerability Description
Google gVisors runsc component exhibited a local **privilege escalation vulnerability** due to **incorrect handling of file access permissions**, which allowed unprivileged users to access restricted files. This occurred because the process initially ran with root-like permissions until the first fork.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **incorrect handling of file access permissions**
- **weakness:** **privilege escalation vulnerability**
- **impact:** local privilege escalation and access restricted files
- **attacker:** unprivileged users
- **product:** Google gVisors runsc component

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The content relates to a vulnerability in gVisor, specifically regarding file capabilities when creating a process from an image. Here's a breakdown of the information extracted:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The code changes address how file capabilities are applied when a process is created from an image.  Specifically, the code now applies the image's file capabilities to the new process. Previously, this wasn't being done correctly, potentially leading to incorrect permissions or security issues.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

The vulnerability stems from not correctly applying file capabilities when creating a process from an image. This could lead to a process having insufficient or incorrect capabilities, potentially allowing for privilege escalation or unauthorized access.

**Impact of exploitation:**

Exploitation could result in a process having incorrect permissions, potentially leading to privilege escalation or unauthorized access to resources.

**Attack vectors:**

An attacker could potentially exploit this by crafting a malicious image with specific file capabilities, and then creating a process from that image.  The process might then have unintended capabilities, allowing the attacker to perform actions they shouldn't be able to.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

The attacker needs to be able to provide an image that is used to create a process. This could be through a containerization platform or other means of process creation.

**Mitigation or fix:**

The code changes implement the following fixes:

*   Adds support for reading file capabilities from images.
*   Applies the file capabilities to the process being created.
*   Handles different versions of file capability implementations (VFS\_CAP\_REVISION\_1, VFS\_CAP\_REVISION\_2, VFS\_CAP\_REVISION\_3).
*   Includes checks to ensure that capabilities are applied correctly, especially for root users.
*   Adds tests to verify the correct application of file capabilities.
*   Adds a new image `basic/filecap` for testing.

**Additional Details:**

The content provides more detail than a typical CVE description, as it includes the specific code changes and tests that were implemented to address the vulnerability. The commit message indicates that the fix involves applying the image's file capabilities when creating a process. The tests added demonstrate how the fix is verified.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* 🔍 *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* 🔍 *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion – CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### 🔸 CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ✅ *“A user created with the ‘guest’ role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ✅ *“The backup service runs as root but only needs read access.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ⚠️ This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### 🔸 CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ✅ *“User can access another user’s invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.”*

## Mapping Examples – Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *“User can escalate privileges to admin.”*
> ❌ Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged – only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ✅ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**

| “Unauthorized read/write to file”           | Permission control issue              | CWE-285                                      |
| “Can access resource without correct role”  | Incorrect or missing permission check | CWE-285, 862, 863                            |

## Good Mapping Examples – Privileges & Permissions

* ✅ **CWE-266**: *“When a new user registers, the system assigns them admin role due to a missing role validation.”*
* ✅ **CWE-250**: *“Installer runs with system-level privileges but doesn't require them to install files in the user directory.”*
* ✅ **CWE-284**: *“Inconsistent access rules between UI and backend for sensitive endpoints.”*
* ✅ **CWE-285**: *“Authorization logic fails to restrict access to finance reports based on department.”*
