  "description": "Rack is a modular Ruby web server interface. Prior to versions 2.2.14, 3.0.16, and 3.1.14, `RackQueryParser` parses query strings and `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` bodies into Ruby data structures without imposing any limit on the number of parameters, allowing attackers to send requests with extremely large numbers of parameters. The vulnerability arises because `RackQueryParser` iterates over each `&`-separated key-value pair and adds it to a Hash without enforcing an upper bound on the total number of parameters. This allows an attacker to send a single request containing hundreds of thousands (or more) of parameters, which consumes excessive memory and CPU during parsing. An attacker can trigger denial of service by sending specifically crafted HTTP requests, which can cause memory exhaustion or pin CPU resources, stalling or crashing the Rack server. This results in full service disruption until the affected worker is restarted. Versions 2.2.14, 3.0.16, and 3.1.14 fix the issue. Some other mitigations are available. One may use middleware to enforce a maximum query string size or parameter count, or employ a reverse proxy (such as Nginx) to limit request sizes and reject oversized query strings or bodies. Limiting request body sizes and query string lengths at the web server or CDN level is an effective mitigation.",

This leads to excessive memory and CPU consumption, which results in **uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400)**, and a denial-of-service condition. **Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value (CWE-789)** and **Improperly Controlled Sequential Memory Allocation (CWE-1325)** are secondary concerns as the root cause is not limiting the number of parameters, which then leads to memory being exhausted.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe primary weakness is the **lack of limits on the number of parameters parsed by RackQueryParser**, leading to excessive resource consumption and denial of service. The assessment is based on the vulnerability description, which explicitly mentions **parsing query strings and bodies without limit on the number of parameters**.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the selection by highlighting the connections between resource allocation, memory consumption, and denial of service. CWE-770 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the root cause of allocating resources without limits.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n*   **CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling**: This CWE accurately describes the vulnerability. The RackQueryParser allocates resources (parameters) without imposing any limits, leading to excessive resource consumption.\n*   **CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption**: While the vulnerability ultimately leads to uncontrolled resource consumption, CWE-400 is a broader class.
