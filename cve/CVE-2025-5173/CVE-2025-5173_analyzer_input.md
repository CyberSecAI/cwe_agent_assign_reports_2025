# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-5173

## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability has been found in HumanSignal label-studio-ml-backend up to 9fb7f4aa186612806af2becfb621f6ed8d9fdbaf and classified as problematic. Affected by this vulnerability is the function load of the file label-studio-ml-backend/label_studio_ml/examples/yolo/utils/neural_nets.py of the component PT File Handler. The manipulation of the argument path leads to **deserialization**. An attack has to be approached locally. This product takes the approach of rolling releases to provide continious delivery. Therefore, version details for affected and updated releases are not available.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **deserialization**

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-5173 Content

This content **IS RELATED** to a potential vulnerability. It provides more detail than a standard CVE description would.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The `load` function uses `torch.load` to deserialize data from a specified path without validation. `torch.load` can execute arbitrary code when loading malicious pickle data.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data.** Specifically, using `torch.load` on untrusted data.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the system running the code.
*   Potential for stealing sensitive information, modifying system files, or launching denial-of-service attacks.

**Attack vectors:**

*   An attacker can craft a malicious `.pt` file (containing malicious pickle data).
*   Trick the application into loading this malicious file using the vulnerable `load` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious `.pt` file to the application, influencing the `path` argument of the `load` function.

**Mitigation or fix:**

The content does not explicitly state a mitigation or fix, but implies that validation of the data before deserialization with `torch.load` is necessary.
