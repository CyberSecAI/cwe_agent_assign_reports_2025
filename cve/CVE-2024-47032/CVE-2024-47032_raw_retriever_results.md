# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-47032

# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-47032
## Query
In construct_transaction_from_cmd of lwis_ioctl.c, there is a possible out of bounds write due to a heap buffer overflow. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.

## Keyphrases
- **weakness**: 'heap buffer overflow', 'out of bounds write'
