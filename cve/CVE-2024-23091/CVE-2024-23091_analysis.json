  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in relation to CVE-2024-23091:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n- The vulnerability stems from the use of the MD5 hashing algorithm for storing user passwords within the `funzioni.php` file of HotelDruid.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Use of MD5:** MD5 is a cryptographically weak hash function prone to collision, preimage, and brute-force attacks. This makes it unsuitable for password hashing.\n- **Lack of Salt (Prior to v1.32):** Older versions of the software did not use salt when hashing passwords. This makes them vulnerable to dictionary and rainbow table attacks.\n- **Weak Salting (Post v1.32):** While versions after 1.32 use a salt, the fundamental weakness of MD5 still leaves passwords vulnerable to attacks. The salt implementation involves a loop that concatenates a portion of the salt with the password and hashes it multiple times, but it still uses MD5 as the base algorithm, which is the core problem.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- An attacker who gains access to the hashed passwords can perform brute-force attacks to recover the original plaintext passwords.\n- Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access to user accounts and sensitive information within the application.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- An attacker needs access to the database where the hashed passwords are stored.\n- With access to the database, the attacker can attempt to crack the MD5 hashes using techniques like brute-force, dictionary attacks, and rainbow table lookups.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- The attacker needs to have gained unauthorized access to the database or system where HotelDruid stores the hashed passwords.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The vulnerability was reported by Cnetsec.\n- The affected component is `funzioni.php`.\n- The affected versions are all versions prior to 1.32. While later versions attempt to use salting, the core vulnerability is the use of MD5 itself.\n- The recommended solution is to replace MD5 with a stronger hashing algorithm such as bcrypt, argon2, or scrypt.\n- The content provides more specific details than the official CVE description placeholder.",

CWE-759 (Use of a One-Way Hash without a Salt) is a variant of CWE-916 (Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort), which in turn is a child of CWE-327 (Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm) and CWE-328.

This leads to the ability for an attacker to **obtain plaintext passwords**, resulting in unauthorized access.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that the **rootcause** is **weak password hashing** using MD5. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also confirms this. The retriever results list CWE-328 (Use of Weak Hash) as the top candidate, and its description aligns perfectly with the vulnerability. The use of MD5 as a hashing algorithm is considered a **weakness** because it's prone to collision attacks, preimage attacks, and brute-force attacks, making it easier for attackers to recover the original passwords.\n\nIf the code did not use a salt, then the secondary weakness would be CWE-759 (Use of a One-Way Hash without a Salt).\n\n# Relevant CWE Information:\n\n## CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an algorithm that produces a digest (output value) that does not meet security expectations for a hash function that allows an adversary to reasonably determine the original input (preimage attack), find another input that can produce the same hash (2nd preimage attack), or find multiple inputs that evaluate to the same hash (birthday attack).\n\n**Why this CWE was selected:**\nThe vulnerability description and CVE reference summary explicitly state that the use of MD5, a weak hashing algorithm, is the root cause of the vulnerability. This aligns directly with the description of CWE-328.\n\"**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the use of the MD5 hashing algorithm...\"\n\n## CWE-759: Use of a One-Way Hash without a Salt\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a one-way cryptographic hash against an input that should not be reversible, such as a password, but the product does not also use a salt as part of the input.\n\n**Why this CWE was considered:**\nThe CVE description mentions that prior versions of the product did not use a salt. While the main issue is the **weak hash**, the absence of a salt could be considered a secondary weakness.\n\"**Lack of Salt (Prior to v1.32):** Older versions of the software did not use salt when hashing passwords.\"\n\n## CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n\n**Description**:\nThe product generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive.\n\n**Why this CWE was not selected:**\nWhile this is related, the **rootcause** is the MD5 hashing algorithm and not necessarily the computational effort required. MD5 is a **weak hash** regardless of computational effort.\n\n## CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm or protocol.\n\n**Why this CWE was not selected:**\nThis is a higher-level class that contains CWE-328.
