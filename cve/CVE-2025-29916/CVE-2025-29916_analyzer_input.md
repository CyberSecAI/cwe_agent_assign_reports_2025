# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-29916

## Vulnerability Description
Suricata is a network Intrusion Detection System, Intrusion Prevention System and Network Security Monitoring engine. Datasets declared in rules have an option to specify the `hashsize` to use. This size setting isnt properly limited, so the hash table allocation can be large. Untrusted rules can lead to large memory allocations, potentially leading to denial of service due to resource starvation. This vulnerability is fixed in 7.0.9.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **component:** hash table allocation
- **product:** Suricata
- **impact:** denial of service, resource starvation

Here's the analysis of the provided content:

The content from github.com and redmine.openinfosecfoundation.org provides information related to the Suricata project, a network security monitoring tool.  Specifically, the GitHub content includes a security advisory (GHSA-27g3-pmvp-j9cv) describing a vulnerability and a commit that addresses it.

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper limits on the `hashsize` setting for datasets declared in Suricata rules. This can lead to large memory allocations.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary weakness is the potential for resource starvation due to unbounded memory allocation.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could exploit this to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition by crafting untrusted rules that trigger excessive memory allocation.
*   **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves supplying untrusted rules to Suricata.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs the ability to supply or inject malicious rules into Suricata.
*   **Mitigation or fix**: The content indicates that upgrading to Suricata version 7.0.9 is the fix.  The commit includes code that adds configurable limits to the hash size.
