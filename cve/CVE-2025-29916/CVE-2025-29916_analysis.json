  "description": "Suricata is a network Intrusion Detection System, Intrusion Prevention System and Network Security Monitoring engine. Datasets declared in rules have an option to specify the `hashsize` to use. This size setting isnt properly limited, so the hash table allocation can be large. Untrusted rules can lead to large memory allocations, potentially leading to denial of service due to resource starvation. This vulnerability is fixed in 7.0.9.",

Specifically, the GitHub content includes a security advisory (GHSA-27g3-pmvp-j9cv) describing a vulnerability and a commit that addresses it.\n\n*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper limits on the `hashsize` setting for datasets declared in Suricata rules. This can lead to large memory allocations.\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary weakness is the potential for resource starvation due to unbounded memory allocation.\n*   **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could exploit this to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition by crafting untrusted rules that trigger excessive memory allocation.\n*   **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves supplying untrusted rules to Suricata.\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs the ability to supply or inject malicious rules into Suricata.\n*   **Mitigation or fix**: The content indicates that upgrading to Suricata version 7.0.9 is the fix.  The commit includes code that adds configurable limits to the hash size.\n\n**Note:** This content provides more detail than the official CVE description, including the specific vulnerability, impact, and fix.\n```",

This is a high level CWE which represents the impact of the vulnerability. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary weakness is CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling), as the **lack of limits** on the `hashsize` allows for excessive memory allocation. CWE-789 (Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value) is a consequence of CWE-770, representing the specific type of resource allocation that is vulnerable. CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) is a high-level class that describes the impact of the vulnerability, and is less specific than CWE-770 and CWE-789.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe789[\"CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    \n    cwe789 -->|CHILDOF| cwe770\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe770 primary\n    class cwe789 secondary\n    class cwe400 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of limits** on the `hashsize` setting (CWE-770). This allows for excessive memory allocation (CWE-789), which ultimately leads to resource exhaustion and denial of service (CWE-400).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary. The root cause of the vulnerability is the **lack of proper limits** on the `hashsize` setting, which allows for large memory allocations. This aligns with CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling). The consequence of this is excessive memory allocation (CWE-789), which can lead to resource starvation and denial of service (CWE-400).\n\nThe evidence from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary states: \"The vulnerability stems from the **lack of proper limits** on the `hashsize` setting for datasets declared in Suricata rules. This can lead to large memory allocations.\"\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-770 being the most specific root cause, CWE-789 being a more specific consequence, and CWE-400 describing the high-level impact.\n\nCWEs Considered But Not Used:\n* CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound): While integer overflows could potentially be involved in calculating the hash size, the primary issue is the **lack of limits** on the size itself, not an overflow during calculation.\n* CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input): The input (`hashsize`) is not validated, but the core issue is that there isn't a limit even if the input were a valid quantity. The **lack of a limit** is the key point.\n* CWE-407 (Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity): While large hash sizes can lead to inefficient algorithms, the root cause is the **unrestricted allocation** that makes this possible.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-617: Reachable Assertion\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains an assert() or similar statement that can be triggered by an attacker, which leads to an application exit or other behavior that is more severe than necessary.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nAn algorithm in a product has an inefficient worst-case computational complexity that may be detrimental to system performance and can be triggered by an attacker, typically using crafted manipulations that ensure that the worst case is being reached.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-129: Improper Validation of Array Index\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses untrusted input when calculating or using an array index, but the product does not validate or incorrectly validates the index to ensure the index references a valid position within the array.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
