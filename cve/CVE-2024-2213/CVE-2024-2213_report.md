# Analysis Report for CVE-2024-2213

# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-2213

## Description

An issue was discovered in zenml-io/zenml versions up to and including 0.55.4. Due to **improper authentication mechanisms**, an attacker with access to an active user session can change the account password without needing to know the current password. This vulnerability allows for unauthorized account takeover by bypassing the standard password change verification process. The issue was fixed in version 0.56.3.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Rootcause:** improper authentication mechanisms
- **Impact:** unauthorized account takeover
- **Attacker:** attacker with access to an active user session
- **Product:** zenml-io/zenml
- **Version:** up to and including 0.55.4

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary

| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-620 | Unverified Password Change | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-287 | Improper Authentication | 0.7 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis

The primary CWE selected is CWE-620, which falls under the broader class of CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication). While CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) is a parent of CWE-1390, CWE-620 is more specific and directly addresses the **lack of verification during password changes**, making it a more accurate representation of the vulnerability.

## Vulnerability Chain

The vulnerability chain starts with **improper authentication mechanisms**, specifically the **lack of old password verification** (CWE-620). This leads to the impact of **unauthorized account takeover**.

Root Cause: CWE-620: Unverified Password Change
Impact: Unauthorized account takeover

## Summary of Analysis

The initial analysis focused on the provided information, particularly the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links content summary. The key phrase "**improper authentication mechanisms**" pointed towards an authentication-related CWE. The CVE Reference Links content summary explicitly mentions the **lack of old password verification** as the root cause.

The Retriever Results highlighted CWE-287 (Improper Authentication), CWE-620 (Unverified Password Change), and CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function). However, after reviewing the complete CWE specifications and the provided guidance, CWE-620 emerged as the most appropriate choice because it precisely describes the vulnerability: the ability to change a password without verifying the current one.

CWE-287 is a higher-level class, and while relevant, it's not as specific as CWE-620. CWE-306 is related to missing authentication for critical functions, which is not the case here; authentication exists, but the password change process is flawed.

The selected CWE (CWE-620) is at the optimal level of specificity (Base) and accurately represents the weakness described in the vulnerability report.

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product requires authentication, but the product has an alternate path or channel that does not require authentication.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-204: Observable Response Discrepancy
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product provides different responses to incoming requests in a way that reveals internal state information to an unauthorized actor outside of the intended control sphere.
