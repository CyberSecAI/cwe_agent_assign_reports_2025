  "description": "An issue was discovered in zenml-io/zenml versions up to and including 0.55.4. Due to **improper authentication mechanisms**, an attacker with access to an active user session can change the account password without needing to know the current password. This vulnerability allows for unauthorized account takeover by bypassing the standard password change verification process. The issue was fixed in version 0.56.3.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the security-related changes made in commit `58cb3d987372c91eb605853c35325701733337c2`:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\nThe commit addresses the issue of users being able to change their passwords without verifying their old password. Additionally, some CLI commands related to user management were missing.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n*   **Lack of old password verification:** Before this commit, users could change their passwords without providing their old password, potentially allowing unauthorized password changes.\n*   **Missing CLI commands:** The absence of certain CLI commands hindered the ability to manage user accounts effectively from the command line.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n*   **Unauthorized Password Changes:** An attacker could potentially change a user's password without knowing the old one. This could lead to account takeover, data breaches, and unauthorized access to the ZenML system.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n*   **Direct manipulation through CLI or API:** An attacker could exploit the lack of old password verification by using the available methods for password change.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n*   **Access to the ZenML server:** The attacker would need to be able to send requests to the ZenML server either through the command line or through API access.\n*   **User account details**: The attacker would need some type of valid user account within the system to attempt to change the password.\n\n**Summary of Changes:**\nThe commit introduces the following security fixes:\n\n*   **Old password verification:** The `update_user` function in `src/zenml/client.py` is updated to require the old password to be passed when a user's password is being changed. It now raises a `ValidationError` if `old_password` is not provided when `updated_password` is set.\n*   **CLI changes:** The `change-password` CLI command in `src/zenml/cli/user_management.py` now prompts the user for the old password as well as the new password, and verifies the new password entered a second time for confirmation.\n*  **Deactivate User CLI Command**: Adds a CLI command to deactivate users, as well as outputting a link to reactivate the user account via the dashboard.\n*   **CLI Warnings:** Added warnings in `src/zenml/cli/server.py` and `src/zenml/cli/user_management.py` about supplying passwords via the command line, instead of using the prompt method, for security reasons.\n*   **Improved documentation and docstrings:**  Added or improved documentation and docstrings throughout the changed files.\n*   **Auto updates**: Added various auto update functions for E2E, LLM Finetuning, and NLP templates.\n\nThis commit strengthens the security of the ZenML system by ensuring that users are required to verify their old password when changing it, adds missing user management CLI commands, and encourages secure methods for password handling.\n\n**Note**: This analysis provides more detail than a generic CVE description would.",

While CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) is a parent of CWE-1390, CWE-620 is more specific and directly addresses the **lack of verification during password changes**, making it a more accurate representation of the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe620[\"CWE-620: Unverified Password Change\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n\n    cwe620 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1390\n    cwe1390 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe620 primary\n    class cwe287,cwe1390 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper authentication mechanisms**, specifically the **lack of old password verification** (CWE-620). This leads to the impact of **unauthorized account takeover**.\n\nRoot Cause: CWE-620: Unverified Password Change\nImpact: Unauthorized account takeover\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial analysis focused on the provided information, particularly the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links content summary. The key phrase \"**improper authentication mechanisms**\" pointed towards an authentication-related CWE. The CVE Reference Links content summary explicitly mentions the **lack of old password verification** as the root cause.\n\nThe Retriever Results highlighted CWE-287 (Improper Authentication), CWE-620 (Unverified Password Change), and CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function). However, after reviewing the complete CWE specifications and the provided guidance, CWE-620 emerged as the most appropriate choice because it precisely describes the vulnerability: the ability to change a password without verifying the current one.\n\nCWE-287 is a higher-level class, and while relevant, it's not as specific as CWE-620. CWE-306 is related to missing authentication for critical functions, which is not the case here; authentication exists, but the password change process is flawed.\n\nThe selected CWE (CWE-620) is at the optimal level of specificity (Base) and accurately represents the weakness described in the vulnerability report.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs
