# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-38439

## Vulnerability Description
Netatalk before 3.2.1 has an **off-by-one error** and resultant **heap-based buffer overflow** because of setting ibuf[PASSWDLEN] to \0 in FPLoginExt in login in etc/uams/uams_pam.c. 2.4.1 and 3.1.19 are also fixed versions.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **off-by-one error**
- **weakness:** **heap-based buffer overflow**
- **product:** Netatalk
- **version:** before 3.2.1
- **component:** FPLoginExt in login in etc/uams/uams_pam.c

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-38439

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of input validation in the `uams_pam.c` file, specifically within the `FPLoginExt` operation of Netatalk's `afpd` daemon.
- The code doesn't properly validate the length field of user-provided data, leading to an out-of-bounds heap write.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Heap out-of-bounds write:** The primary weakness is the ability to write one byte (a null byte `\0`) beyond the allocated buffer on the heap.
- **Lack of input validation:** The vulnerability is caused by insufficient validation of the length field in user-supplied data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Code Execution:** In certain configurations, the out-of-bounds write can overwrite metadata of the next heap block. This can allow an attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution with root privileges.
- **System Compromise:** Successful exploitation could lead to a complete compromise of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is triggered via network requests, specifically through the `FPLoginExt` operation.
- **Clear Text User Authentication:** The vulnerability is triggered when logging in with the "Clear Text" user authentication module (`uams_clrtxt.so` or `uams_pam.so`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No privileges required:** The attacker does not need any existing privileges on the system to exploit this vulnerability.
- **No user interaction required:** The attack can be performed without any action from the legitimate users of the system.
- **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable service.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable code paths were introduced in Netatalk version 1.5.0.
- The vulnerability is located in the `login` function of `uams_pam.c`.
- The specific line of code causing the out-of-bounds write is `ibuf[ PASSWDLEN ] = '\0';`.
- The `PASSWDLEN` is defined as 8, meaning the code attempts to write a null byte 8 bytes after the beginning of the `ibuf` buffer.
- The vulnerability exists because the length of the user-supplied data is not properly validated before performing the write operation.
- The vulnerability can be mitigated by disabling the `uams_clrtxt.so` or `uams_pam.so` authentication modules or by applying the patch.

**Affected Versions:**
- Netatalk versions 3.2.0, 3.0.0 - 3.1.18, and 1.5.0 - 2.4.0 are vulnerable.

**Patched Versions:**
- Netatalk versions 3.2.1, 3.1.19, and 2.4.1 include the security patch.

**Workaround:**
- Disable the `uams_clrtxt.so` or `uams_pam.so` authentication module in the `afp.conf` file.

**CVSS Score:**
- CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L (7.3)
