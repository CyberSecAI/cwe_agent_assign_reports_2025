# Vulnerability Description

    A vulnerability has been identified in TeleControl Server Basic (All versions < V3.1.2.2). The affected product **does not properly validate a length field in a serialized message** which it uses to determine the amount of memory to be allocated for **deserialization**. This could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to cause the application to allocate exhaustive amounts of memory and subsequently create a partial denial of service condition. Successful exploitation is only possible in redundant Telecontrol Server Basic setups and only if the connection between the redundant servers has been disrupted.
