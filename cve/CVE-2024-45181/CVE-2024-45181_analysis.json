This allows for specially crafted calls to the driver to write data to arbitrary memory addresses, leading to kernel memory corruption.\n*  **Impact of Exploitation:**\n    *   Kernel memory corruption, which could lead to a system crash (Denial of Service).\n    *   The potential for other malicious activities due to the arbitrary memory write.\n*   **Attack Vectors:**\n    *   Local access is required to exploit this vulnerability. It cannot be exploited remotely over a network.\n*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n    *   An attacker needs local access to a system with the vulnerable WibuKey driver installed.\n    *   The attacker also needs the ability to make specially crafted calls to the vulnerable driver.\n* **Affected Products:**\n    * WibuKey versions prior to 6.70 for Windows.\n*   **Mitigation:**\n    *   Upgrade to WibuKey version 6.70 or later.\n    *   Restrict local access to systems with the vulnerable driver.\n    *   If using a Windows server as a WibuKey network license server, consider switching to Linux or macOS.\n*   **CVSS Score:**\n    *   CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 8.8 (AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)\n    *   CVSS v4.0 Base Score: 9.3 (CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:H/SI:H/SA:H)\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n*   The advisory clearly states that the vulnerability is specific to the legacy WibuKey product and does not affect the successor product, CodeMeter.\n*   The advisory acknowledges Team \"\uc6b0\ub9ac \uc624\ub298\ubd80\ud130 0-day\" for reporting this vulnerability.\n\nThis detailed information is more comprehensive than a basic CVE description, offering specific insights into the vulnerability's technical aspects, attack vectors, and mitigation strategies.",

The evidence for this is explicitly stated in the vulnerability description: \"**improper bounds check** allows crafted packets to cause an arbitrary address write, resulting in kernel **memory corruption**.\" The CVE reference link summary confirms this, stating: \"Root Cause: Improper buffer bounds check in the WibuKey driver...
