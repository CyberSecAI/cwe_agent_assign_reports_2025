However, without more information about the exact nature of the exposed information and the mechanism of exposure, it is difficult to justify selecting one of these over CWE-200.\n\nTherefore, CWE-200 is selected as the primary CWE with a confidence of 0.8. This choice reflects the high-level nature of the vulnerability description and the lack of specific details about the root cause.",
