Affected is the function cgi_FMT_R12R5_1st_DiskMGR of the file /cgi-bin/hd_config.cgi. The manipulation of the argument f_source_dev leads to command injection. It is possible to launch the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. NOTE This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer. NOTE Vendor was contacted early and confirmed that the product is end-of-life. It should be retired and replaced.",
