CWE-601 and CWE-425 are related in that they describe potential attack vectors that could exploit the **missing authentication**. CWE-306 is a base level CWE, appropriate for the level of detail provided in the description.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe601[\"CWE-601: URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')\"]\n    cwe425[\"CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\"]\n    \n    cwe601 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe306\n    cwe425 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe306\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe306 primary\n    class cwe601,cwe425 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authentication** for the hidden login page redirect functionality (CWE-306). This allows an unauthenticated attacker to access the hidden login page, either through a crafted URL leading to an open redirect (CWE-601) or by directly requesting the hidden login page (CWE-425). The chain represents the progression from the initial flaw to the final impact.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-306 as the primary weakness because the plugin **does not prevent redirects to the login page via the `auth_redirect` WordPress function**. This is a clear case of **missing authentication** for a critical function. The retriever results also suggested CWE-601 and CWE-425, which are plausible attack vectors given the **missing authentication**.\n\nThe evidence strongly supports CWE-306 as the primary CWE. The vulnerability description clearly states that the plugin **does not prevent redirects**, indicating a **lack of authentication** for this function.\n\nThe graph relationships confirm that CWE-601 and CWE-425 can follow CWE-306. This means that the **missing authentication** (CWE-306) can lead to an open redirect (CWE-601) or direct request (CWE-425).\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately represent the **root cause** and potential attack vectors of the vulnerability.\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this
