  "description": "IrfanView DXF File Parsing Memory Corruption Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of IrfanView. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of DXF files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a **memory corruption** condition. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-24598.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the improper validation of user-supplied data when parsing DXF files in IrfanView, leading to a memory corruption.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n*   **Memory Corruption:** Lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during DXF file parsing. This can lead to memory corruption due to an invalid memory access when processing the malicious DXF file.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n*   **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process (i.e., the IrfanView application).\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n*   **Malicious File:** The user must open a specially crafted, malicious DXF file.\n*   **Malicious Page:** The user must visit a malicious page, presumably that would initiate the processing of the malicious DXF file, likely using the Irfanview application.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n*   The attacker needs to be able to deliver the malicious DXF file to the victim, or convince the victim to visit a malicious page.\n*   No special privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability. The user interaction (opening the file or visiting the page) is sufficient.\n\n**Additional details:**\n* The vulnerability is fixed in IrfanView version 4.70 with plugins version 4.70.\n*  The CVSS score is 7.8, with the vector: AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H, which translates to:\n    *   **AV:L (Attack Vector: Local):** The attacker needs to be able to deliver the exploit file to the victim's local system or have some access that would allow triggering local file handling by IrfanView.\n    *   **AC:L (Attack Complexity: Low):** The attack is easily achieved.\n    *   **PR:N (Privileges Required: None):** No special privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability.\n    *   **UI:R (User Interaction: Required):** User interaction is needed to exploit the vulnerability (opening a malicious file or visiting malicious web page).\n    *   **S:U (Scope: Unchanged):** An exploited vulnerability impacts only the vulnerable component.\n    *   **C:H (Confidentiality: High):** There is a high impact on the confidentiality of the system.\n    *   **I:H (Integrity: High):** There is a high impact on the integrity of the system.\n    *   **A:H (Availability: High):** There is a high impact on the availability of the system.",

It is related to CWE-119, which is a class-level CWE describing improper restrictions of operations within memory buffers. CWE-20 is also a class-level CWE related to improper input validation. CWE-787 is often a consequence of failing to properly validate input (CWE-20) and can lead to broader memory corruption issues (CWE-119).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe20 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe787\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe20 secondary\n    class cwe119 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper validation of user-supplied data** (CWE-20), leading to a **memory corruption** condition. The specific type of memory corruption is an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787), which then enables remote code execution.\n\nCWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) -> CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) -> Remote Code Execution\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data** as the root cause, leading to **memory corruption**. The retriever results and similar CVE descriptions strongly suggested CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) as the primary CWE, supported by the evidence of memory corruption due to improper data validation during DXF file parsing. While CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) is present, it is better to assign CWE-787 as the primary to define the weakness.\n\n- **CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write):** This is the most specific CWE that accurately describes the **memory corruption** condition resulting from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**. The description mentions the vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code due to a flaw within the parsing of DXF files, implying data is being written outside the intended buffer. Confidence: 0.95\n\n- **CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation):** The **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data** is a clear indication of improper input validation. This could be considered a contributing factor. However, CWE-20 is a high-level class and the vulnerability description points to a specific memory corruption issue (out-of-bounds write), making CWE-787 a more precise choice. Confidence: 0.75\n\nOther CWEs considered but not used:\n\n- **CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer):** While related, CWE-119 is a more general class. CWE-787 is a specific type of memory buffer issue and thus a better fit.\n- **CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read):** The vulnerability description explicitly mentions memory corruption, which is more indicative of a write operation (CWE-787) rather than a read operation (CWE-125).\n- **CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow):** While a heap-based buffer overflow could be possible, the description lacks the specificity to confirm it. The more general \"out-of-bounds write\" is more appropriate given the available information.",
