In this case, the **CSRF** vulnerability enables the **Stored XSS**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    \n    cwe79 -->|IMPACT| cwe352\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe79 primary\n    class cwe352 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** vulnerability, which allows an attacker to force a user to perform unwanted actions. This can then lead to **Stored XSS** because the forged request can inject malicious scripts into the application, which are then executed when other users view the affected page.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is **CWE-79** because the vulnerability involves **Stored XSS**, which arises from improper neutralization of input. The presence of **CWE-352** **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** is also indicated in the description because this attack enables the injection of the malicious script.
