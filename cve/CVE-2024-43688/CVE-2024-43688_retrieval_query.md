- **product:** OpenBSD
- **version:** 7.4 and 7.5
- **component:** cron/entry.c in vixie cron

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-43688:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a heap underflow in the `set_range()` function within Vixie Cron's `entry.c`, specifically how it handles step values in crontab entries.
*   The `set_range` function calculates an index into a bitstring using a loop that increments a counter by the provided step value. A large step value (greater than what an `int` can hold), specifically crafted to be interpreted as negative, can cause the loop to write out of bounds before exiting.
*   The vulnerability is triggered by the `bit_set` function, which uses an attacker-controlled index calculated from the loop in `set_range` to set a bit in the `bits` bitstring, and allows an attacker to modify memory locations before the start of the bits array.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap Underflow:** The primary vulnerability is a heap underflow condition. The `bit_set` function uses a calculated index that can go beyond the allocated buffer. This out-of-bounds write allows an attacker to overwrite memory before the `bits` array.
*   **Integer Overflow:**  The vulnerability is caused because the `atoi()` function used to parse the step value can return negative numbers on 64-bit builds when provided a very large positive number due to integer overflow in the `strtol` function that it relies on.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Memory Write:** The attacker can overwrite arbitrary memory locations within a 256MB range before the `bits` buffer. This write primitive, though blind, can be used to modify critical data structures on the heap.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** By carefully crafting the underflow, an attacker can potentially overwrite a `passwd` structure within a `cron` process to gain root privileges. In `crontab`, ASLR bypass opportunities are possible through partial modification of heap data structures.
*  **Denial of Service:** Overwriting memory in `cron` can lead to crashes, resulting in a denial of service as OpenBSD will not restart the daemon.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crontab Manipulation:** An attacker can craft a malicious crontab entry with a specific step value that causes the heap underflow when processed by the `crontab` command.
*   **Cron Daemon Exploitation:** The vulnerability can also be exploited by creating malicious crontab files, which the `cron` daemon processes. This can lead to the execution of commands with elevated privileges if the heap corruption is successful.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **User Access:** An attacker needs the ability to create or modify crontab entries. This means having user-level access to the system.
*   **64-bit System:** The vulnerability is easier to trigger on 64-bit systems due to how `atoi` handles large numbers. 32-bit systems are less susceptible because `atoi` will not return the large negative numbers required to cause an underflow.
*   **Understanding of Heap Layout:** Successful exploitation, especially against the `cron` daemon, requires an understanding of how heap allocations work in OpenBSD. It might be necessary to perform a heap spray or utilize other techniques to ensure the attacker can overwrite the desired structures.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was introduced in May 2023 with the introduction of the `set_range` function.
*   The provided proof of concept (PoC) shows how to trigger the underflow by supplying a very large step value in the crontab entry.
*   The provided exploit aims to overwrite the `pwd` field in the `entry` struct to point to a crafted `passwd` struct in the environment, leading to a user uid of 0.
*   The vulnerability affects both `crontab` and the `cron` daemon.
*   The vulnerability can be mitigated using the patch provided in the commit link.
*   The provided code snippets show how a user could generate a malicious crontab file and a modified entry.c with debugging and memory mapping checks.

This detailed analysis should provide a comprehensive understanding of the vulnerability.

- **CVE-2001-1391:** Off-by-one vulnerability in driver allows users to modify kernel memory.
- **CVE-2002-0083:** Off-by-one error allows local users or remote malicious servers to gain privileges.




## CWE-195: Signed to Unsigned Conversion Error
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses a signed primitive and performs a cast to an unsigned primitive, which can produce an unexpected value if the value of the signed primitive can not be represented using an unsigned primitive.

### Extended Description


It is dangerous to rely on implicit casts between signed and unsigned numbers because the result can take on an unexpected value and violate assumptions made by the program.


Often, functions will return negative values to indicate a failure. When the result of a function is to be used as a size parameter, using these negative return values can have unexpected results. For example, if negative size values are passed to the standard memory copy or allocation functions they will be implicitly cast to a large unsigned value. This may lead to an exploitable buffer overflow or underflow condition.


### Alternative Terms
None

**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Heap-based buffer overflows are usually just as dangerous as stack-based buffer overflows.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-43537:** Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)
- **CVE-2007-4268:** Chain: integer signedness error (CWE-195) passes signed comparison, leading to heap overflow (CWE-122)
- **CVE-2009-2523:** Chain: product does not handle when an input string is not NULL terminated (CWE-170), leading to buffer over-read (CWE-125) or heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).




## CWE-126: Buffer Over-read
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations after the targeted buffer.

### Extended Description
This typically occurs when the pointer or its index is incremented to a position beyond the bounds of the buffer or when pointer arithmetic results in a position outside of the valid memory location to name a few. This may result in exposure of sensitive information or possibly a crash.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-125
ChildOf -> CWE-788

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** These problems may be resultant from missing sentinel values (CWE-463) or trusting a user-influenced input length variable.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-1733:** Text editor has out-of-bounds read past end of line while indenting C code
- **CVE-2014-0160:** Chain: "Heartbleed" bug receives an inconsistent length parameter (CWE-130) enabling an out-of-bounds read (CWE-126), returning memory that could include private cryptographic keys and other sensitive data.
- **CVE-2009-2523:** Chain: product does not handle when an input string is not NULL terminated, leading to buffer over-read or heap-based buffer overflow.




## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product performs a calculation that can
         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic
         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than
         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is
         incremented to a value that is too large to store in the
         associated representation. When this occurs, the value may
         become a very small or negative number.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Overflow: The terms "overflow" and "wraparound" are used interchangeably by some people, but they can have more precise distinctions by others. See Terminology Notes.
Wraparound: The terms "overflow" and "wraparound" are used interchangeably by some people, but they can have more precise distinctions by others. See Terminology Notes.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Be careful of terminology problems with "overflow," "underflow," and "wraparound" - see Terminology Notes. Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use
**Suggested Alternatives:**
- CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound). Consider CWE-191 when the result is less than the minimum value that can be represented (sometimes called "underflows").


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Integer overflows can be primary to buffer overflows when they cause less memory to be allocated than expected.

**[Terminology]** 

"Integer overflow" is sometimes used to cover several types of errors, including signedness errors, or buffer overflows that involve manipulation of integer data types instead of characters. Part of the confusion results from the fact that 0xffffffff is -1 in a signed context. Other confusion also arises because of the role that integer overflows have in chains.


A "wraparound" is a well-defined, standard behavior that follows specific rules for how to handle situations when the intended numeric value is too large or too small to be represented, as specified in standards such as C11.


"Overflow" is sometimes conflated with "wraparound" but typically indicates a non-standard or undefined behavior.


The "overflow" term is sometimes used to indicate cases where either the maximum or the minimum is exceeded, but others might only use "overflow" to indicate exceeding the maximum while using "underflow" for exceeding the minimum.


Some people use "overflow" to mean any value outside the representable range - whether greater than the maximum, or less than the minimum - but CWE uses "underflow" for cases in which the intended result is less than the minimum.


See [REF-1440] for additional explanation of the ambiguity of terminology.


**[Other]** While there may be circumstances in which the logic intentionally relies on wrapping - such as with modular arithmetic in timers or counters - it can have security consequences if the wrap is unexpected. This is especially the case if the integer overflow can be triggered using user-supplied inputs.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-43537:** Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)
- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).
- **CVE-2022-0545:** Chain: 3D renderer has an integer overflow (CWE-190) leading to write-what-where condition (CWE-123) using a crafted image.




## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.

### Extended Description
This can happen in signed and unsigned cases.

### Alternative Terms
Integer underflow: 

"Integer underflow" is sometimes used to identify signedness errors in which an originally positive number becomes negative as a result of subtraction. However, there are cases of bad subtraction in which unsigned integers are involved, so it's not always a signedness issue.


"Integer underflow" is occasionally used to describe array index errors in which the index is negative.

## CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties.

### Extended Description


Specified quantities include size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, and others. Code may rely on specified quantities to allocate resources, perform calculations, control iteration, etc. When the quantity is not properly validated, then attackers can specify malicious quantities to cause excessive resource allocation, trigger unexpected failures, enable buffer overflows, etc.
