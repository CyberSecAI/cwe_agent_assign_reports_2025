## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability in lunary-ai/lunary, as of commit be54057, allows users to upload and execute arbitrary regular expressions on the server side. This can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition, as certain regular expressions can cause excessive resource consumption, blocking the server from processing other requests.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** resource consumption and Denial of Service
- **vector:** upload and execute arbitrary regular expressions
- **attacker:** users
- **product:** lunary-ai/lunary
- **version:** commit be54057
