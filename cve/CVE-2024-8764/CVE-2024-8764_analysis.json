CWE-400, Uncontrolled Resource Consumption, is a class-level CWE that describes the impact of the vulnerability. CWE-1333 can lead to CWE-400.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1333[\"CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n\n    cwe1333 -->|CAN_LEAD_TO| cwe400\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1333 primary\n    class cwe400 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **inefficient regular expression** (CWE-1333).

The vulnerability description clearly states that users can upload and execute arbitrary regular expressions, which can lead to excessive resource consumption. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms that the fix addresses a ReDoS vulnerability.\n\nCWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) is a potential secondary CWE, but it represents the impact rather than the root cause. While the vulnerability does lead to resource consumption and a DoS condition, the underlying issue is the inefficient regular expression itself. Thus, CWE-1333 is more precise.\n\nThe retriever results also highlight CWE-1333 as the top candidate, further supporting the selection of this CWE. The usage guidance for CWE-1333 is \"Allowed,\" indicating that it is an appropriate choice for mapping.\n\nThe provided evidence strongly supports the selection of CWE-1333 as the primary CWE, with high confidence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a regular expression with an inefficient, possibly exponential worst-case computational complexity that consumes excessive CPU cycles.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-185: Incorrect Regular Expression\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product specifies a regular expression in a way that causes data to be improperly matched or compared.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web server receives a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-90: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an LDAP Query ('LDAP Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an LDAP query using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended LDAP query when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-625: Permissive Regular Expression\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a regular expression that does not sufficiently restrict the set of allowed values.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-617: Reachable Assertion\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains an assert() or similar statement that can be triggered by an attacker, which leads to an application exit or other behavior that is more severe than necessary.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1286: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.67\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input that is expected to be well-formed -
