- **version:** before 2025-05-07

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
```text
Root cause of vulnerability:
*   The Radware Cloud Web Application Firewall (WAF) is vulnerable to filter bypass via specially crafted HTTP requests. One method involves including random data in the HTTP request body with a HTTP GET method. Another is insufficient validation of user-supplied input when processing special characters.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
*   Filter bypass: allows malicious inputs to reach the underlying web application.

Impact of exploitation:
*   An attacker can bypass the WAF, allowing malicious inputs to reach the underlying web application.

Attack vectors:
*   Crafted HTTP requests with random data in the body and a GET method.
*   Adding special characters to the request.

Mitigation or fix:
*   The vulnerabilities appear to be fixed. Radware acknowledged the vulnerability, fixed the issue, and published a technical knowledge base article.
