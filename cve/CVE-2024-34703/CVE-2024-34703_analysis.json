  "description": "Botan is a C++ cryptography library. X.509 certificates can identify elliptic curves using either an object identifier or using explicit encoding of the parameters. Prior to versions 3.3.0 and 2.19.4, an attacker could present an ECDSA X.509 certificate using explicit encoding where the parameters are very large. The proof of concept used a 16Kbit prime for this purpose. When parsing, the parameter is checked to be prime, causing excessive computation. This was patched in 2.19.4 and 3.3.0 to allow the prime parameter of the elliptic curve to be at most 521 bits. No known workarounds are available. Note that support for explicit encoding of elliptic curve parameters is deprecated in Botan.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-34703:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input validation when decoding elliptic curve parameters in X.509 certificates. Specifically, when an X.509 certificate uses explicit encoding for elliptic curve parameters, the prime parameter 'p' was not sufficiently limited in size. This allowed an attacker to provide a very large prime number which requires excessive computation to check for primality.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n- **Lack of Input Validation:** The code did not impose a maximum limit on the size of the prime 'p' during the decoding of elliptic curve parameters.\n- **Resource Exhaustion:** The excessive computation required to check the primality of very large numbers leads to a denial-of-service condition.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By providing a crafted X.509 certificate with an overly large prime parameter, an attacker could cause the system to exhaust computational resources while performing the primality check. This could lead to service unavailability.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n- **Malicious X.509 Certificates:** An attacker could craft a malicious X.509 certificate that includes explicit encoding of elliptic curve parameters with a large prime 'p'. This could be sent during TLS handshakes or other processes involving X.509 certificates.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n- The attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted X.509 certificate to the vulnerable system, which typically involves being in a position to initiate a connection or otherwise provide the certificate. No special privileges are needed.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n- The vulnerability was addressed by adding a size limit of 1024 bits on the prime parameter `p`, and later refined to 521 bits in the patches.\n- The code change shown in the provided diffs is related to adding the size check of the prime 'p'. Specifically, it adds the following validation: `if(p.bits() < 112 || p.bits() > 1024)`. This limits the size of the prime to between 112 and 1024 bits, preventing excessively large numbers from being processed.\n- The GitHub Security Advisory (GHSA-w4g2-7m2h-7xj7) explicitly mentions a 16Kbit prime being used in a Proof of Concept (POC).\n- Support for explicit encoding of elliptic curve parameters is deprecated in the library.\n\nThe provided information is more detailed than the typical CVE description, giving a precise root cause, attack vector, and fix.",

CWE-770 is a parent of CWE-400, and given the description of the vulnerability leading to denial of service due to excessive computation, both are relevant. I chose CWE-770 as the primary as it's the **rootcause** of the vulnerability by not limiting the prime size, eventually leading to resource exhaustion (CWE-400). There is also a connection between CWE-770 and CWE-1284, since the allocation of resources is tied to the size of input. The excessive computation results from **improper validation** of the size of the prime number, which is the quantity in input (CWE-1284).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion')\"]\n    cwe1284[\"CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\"]\n\n    cwe400 -->|CHILDOF| cwe770\n    cwe1284 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe770\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe770 primary\n    class cwe400,cwe1284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of weaknesses begins with **improper input validation** of the elliptic curve parameters (specifically, the prime number size). This leads to **uncontrolled resource allocation**, as the system attempts to perform primality checks on excessively large numbers. The final impact is **resource exhaustion**, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis heavily relies on the detailed information provided in the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary,\" which identifies the lack of input validation as the root cause. The description indicates that the vulnerability exists because the system does not properly limit the size of the prime parameter, leading to excessive computation and resource exhaustion.\n\nThe selection of CWE-770 is justified by the fact that the system allocates resources (CPU time) without proper limits or throttling. CWE-1284 represents that the quantity in input was not validated. CWE-400 is a related weakness, representing the impact of the vulnerability (resource exhaustion/DoS).
