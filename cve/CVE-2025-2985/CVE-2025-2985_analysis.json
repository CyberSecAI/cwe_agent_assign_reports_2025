  "description": "A vulnerability was found in code-projects Payroll Management System 1.0. It has been classified as critical. This affects an unknown part of the file update_account.php. The manipulation of the argument deduction leads to **sql injection**. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. Other parameters might be affected as well.",
