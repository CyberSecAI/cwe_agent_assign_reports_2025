# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-48796

## Vulnerability Description
An issue in EQUES com.eques.plug 1.0.1 allows a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information via the firmware update process.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** obtain sensitive information
- **attacker:** remote attacker
- **product:** EQUES com.eques.plug
- **version:** 1.0.1
- **component:** firmware update process

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the lack of proper access control on the firmware server used by the `com.eques.plug` application. The server does not require any authentication or authorization to download firmware files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Access Control:** The primary weakness is the absence of access control mechanisms on the firmware server. This allows anyone with the correct URL to download firmware files.
*   **Firmware Leakage:** The unprotected server leads to the leakage of firmware files.
*   **Insecure Firmware Update Mechanism:** The application uses HTTP requests without authentication to download updates.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Firmware Download:** Attackers can download the latest firmware files intended for devices.
*   **Firmware Analysis and Reverse Engineering:** Downloaded firmware can be analyzed for vulnerabilities, sensitive data, or proprietary information, potentially leading to further exploitation.
*   **Creation of Malicious Firmware:** Attackers can modify the downloaded firmware to include malicious code.
*   **Distribution of Compromised Firmware:** Modified firmware can be redistributed to unsuspecting users, leading to device compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct HTTP Requests:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending direct HTTP requests to the firmware server using the URLs identified from the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Reverse Engineering Skills:** Attackers need to reverse engineer the `com.eques.plug` application to identify the firmware download URLs and the mechanism used for HTTP requests.
*   **Network Access:** Attackers need access to the internet to send HTTP requests to the firmware server.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability does not require any prior access or authentication to the system or device.

**Additional Details:**

*   The report indicates that 6 firmware files were successfully downloaded.
*   The report provides specific examples of the HTTP requests and responses involved in exploiting the vulnerability.
*   The vendor's website for EQUES is included.

**In Summary:**

The identified vulnerability is a serious issue of incorrect access control that allows unauthorized access to firmware. This can lead to various malicious activities including device compromise by replacing the original firmware with a malicious one, impacting the devices that use the `com.eques.plug` application.
