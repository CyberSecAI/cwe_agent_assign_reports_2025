# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-45738

## Vulnerability Description
In Splunk Enterprise versions below 9.3.1, 9.2.3, and 9.1.6, the software potentially exposes sensitive HTTP parameters to the `_internal` index. This exposure could happen if you configure the Splunk Enterprise `REST_Calls` log channel at the DEBUG logging level.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** exposes sensitive HTTP parameters to the _internal index
- **product:** Splunk Enterprise
- **version:** below 9.3.1, 9.2.3, and 9.1.6
- **component:** REST_Calls log channel

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-45738:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from sensitive HTTP parameters being exposed to the `_internal` index when the `REST_Calls` log channel in Splunk Enterprise is configured to the DEBUG logging level.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive information, such as HTTP parameters, is logged to the `_internal` index.
- **Overly Verbose Logging:** The DEBUG logging level for the `REST_Calls` channel includes sensitive data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker with access to the `_internal` index or the log files can potentially gain access to sensitive information, such as keys or tokens, contained in HTTP parameters.
- This could lead to further attacks, including unauthorized access, data breaches, or privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** An attacker with high privileges to Splunk instance
- **Local File Access:** Local access to the `splunkd.log` files on the Splunk Enterprise instance.
- **Internal Index Access:** Administrative access to the `_internal` index in Splunk.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Privileged Access:** The attacker needs administrative-level access to Splunk to access the internal indexes, or local access to the log files.
- **Knowledge of Splunk:** Understanding of how Splunk logs information and where to look for exposed data.
