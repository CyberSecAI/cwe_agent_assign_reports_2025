# Analysis Report for CVE-2024-13430

# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-13430

## Description

The Page Builder Pagelayer Drag and Drop website builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 1.9.8 via the pagelayer_builder_posts_shortcode function due to **insufficient restrictions on which posts can be included**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to extract data from private posts that they should not have access to.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Rootcause:** insufficient restrictions on which posts can be included
- **Impact:** extract data from private posts that they should not have access to
- **Attacker:** authenticated attackers with Contributor-level access and above
- **Product:** Page Builder Pagelayer Drag and Drop website builder plugin for WordPress
- **Version:** all versions up to and including 1.9.8
- **Component:** pagelayer_builder_posts_shortcode function

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-863 | Incorrect Authorization | 0.9 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Primary CWE. The product performs an authorization check, but it does not correctly perform the check. |
| CWE-538 | Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary candidate. The product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.75
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that impacted my decision was the hierarchical relationship, where more specific child CWEs can provide better representations of the vulnerability compared to parent CWEs.
  - The vulnerability involves **incorrect authorization**, a Class-level CWE, which is related to more specific Base-level CWEs.
  - There is a potential chain where **incorrect authorization** leads to the **insertion of sensitive information into an externally-accessible file or directory.**
  - Peer relationships were considered, but they did not provide a more accurate classification than the selected CWEs.
  - Abstraction levels were crucial in selecting the most granular CWE possible, favoring Base-level CWEs when appropriate.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **insufficient restrictions on which posts can be included** (leading to **incorrect authorization**), which allows authenticated attackers to **extract data from private posts that they should not have access to** (**insertion of sensitive information into an externally-accessible file or directory**).

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis identified several potential CWEs, with the most relevant ones being related to authorization issues and information exposure. The primary CWE, CWE-863 (**Incorrect Authorization**), was selected because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions **insufficient restrictions on which posts can be included**, which aligns with the definition of **incorrect authorization**. The secondary CWE, CWE-538 (**Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory**), was considered because the impact of the vulnerability leads to the exposure of sensitive information.

The graph relationships influenced the final selection by highlighting the potential chain of events, where an authorization issue leads to information exposure. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately represent the **root cause** and the impact of the vulnerability. The analysis relies heavily on the provided evidence, specifically the vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
**Abstraction Level**: Compound
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.



## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-1336: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69

**Description**:
The product uses a template engine to insert or process externally-influenced input, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements or syntax that can be interpreted as template expressions or other code directives when processed by the engine.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
