This content describes multiple vulnerabilities identified in libming v0.4.8. This information appears to be more detailed than the CVE description.

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:**
    *   **bug1:** Out-of-memory error in `parseABC_NS_SET_INFO` function when allocating memory during parsing of ABC bytecode.
    *   **bug2:** Memory leak in `parseSWF_ENABLEDEBUGGER2` function where memory allocated for reading strings is not deallocated.
    *   **bug3:** Memory leak in `parseSWF_PLACEOBJECT3` function due to improper handling of memory allocation when reading strings.
    *   **bug4:** Segmentation fault (SEGV) in `decompileRETURN` function due to a READ memory access to an invalid address.
    *   **bug5:** Memory leak in `parseSWF_INITACTION` due to improper memory reallocation.
    *   **bug6:** Out-of-memory error in `parseABC_STRING_INFO` function during ABC bytecode parsing.
    *   **bug7:** Memory leak in `parseSWF_MORPHLINESTYLES` due to improper handling of memory allocation.
    *   **bug8:** Segmentation fault (SEGV) in `decompileCALLMETHOD` function due to a READ memory access to an invalid address.
    *   **bug9:** Segmentation fault (SEGV) in `decompileSETVARIABLE` function due to a READ memory access to an invalid address.
    *   **bug10:** Allocation-size-too-big error in `parseSWF_DEFINEBINARYDATA`.
    *   **bug11:** Segmentation fault (SEGV) in `decompileGETPROPERTY` function due to a READ memory access to an invalid address.
    *   **bug12:** Segmentation fault (SEGV) in `decompileGETMEMBER` function due to a READ memory access to an invalid address.
    *   **bug13:** Segmentation fault (SEGV) in `decompileIMPLEMENTS` function due to a READ memory access to an invalid address.
    *   **bug14:** Segmentation fault (SEGV) in `decompileDUPLICATECLIP` function due to a READ memory access to an invalid address.
    *   **bug15:** Memory leak in `parseSWF_MORPHFILLSTYLES` due to improper handling of memory allocation.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   Memory corruption
    *   Memory leaks
    *   Out-of-memory errors
    *   Segmentation faults

*   **Impact of exploitation:**
