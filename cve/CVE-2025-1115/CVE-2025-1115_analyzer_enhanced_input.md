## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-1115 Content

Based on the provided content, this relates to a vulnerability report for RT-Thread Smart. The report details a potential information leak due to insufficient parameter validation in the syscall implementation.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

Insufficient validation of the `arg[0]` parameter (a `char *` pointer representing the thread name) in the `sys_thread_create` function within `rt-thread/components/lwp/lwp_syscall.c`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **CWE-200: Information Leak:**  The lack of validation allows a malicious user thread to potentially pass a crafted pointer that references kernel memory.

**Impact of exploitation:**

An information leak, potentially allowing unauthorized access to sensitive kernel data.

**Attack vectors:**

A malicious user thread passing a crafted `char *` pointer as the `arg[0]` parameter to the `sys_thread_create` syscall.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

The attacker needs to be a user thread within the RT-Thread Smart environment.

**Mitigation or fix:**

The report does not specify a mitigation or fix, but implies that proper validation of the `arg[0]` pointer is required to prevent the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

The content provides more detail than a typical CVE description, including the vulnerable code location and a specific code snippet. It also references the CWE identifier.
