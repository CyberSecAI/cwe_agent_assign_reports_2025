# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-9751

## Vulnerability Description
Tungsten Automation Power PDF JP2 File Parsing **Out-Of-Bounds Read** Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Tungsten Automation Power PDF. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of JP2 files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated object. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-24468.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-9751:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the parsing of JP2 files within Tungsten Automation Power PDF.
- The issue is caused by a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during JP2 file processing, leading to an out-of-bounds read.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-bounds Read:** The software reads data beyond the allocated memory buffer when processing a specially crafted JP2 file. This can lead to unexpected behavior, crashes, or other security issues.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application fails to adequately validate data within the JP2 file, allowing a malicious file to cause an out-of-bounds read.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on a victim's system. This means they could potentially gain full control over the system, install malware, steal data, or perform other malicious actions.
- **Context of the current process:** The code execution occurs in the context of the current user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious File:** An attacker can craft a malicious JP2 file and trick the victim into opening it using Tungsten Automation Power PDF.
- **Malicious Web Page:** An attacker could host a malicious page that attempts to load the crafted JP2 file when the victim navigates to it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver a crafted JP2 file to the target user. This could involve sending it via email, hosting it on a malicious webpage, or through any means that results in a user opening the file in Tungsten Automation Power PDF.
- The attack requires user interaction; specifically, the user must open the malicious file or visit a malicious page.
