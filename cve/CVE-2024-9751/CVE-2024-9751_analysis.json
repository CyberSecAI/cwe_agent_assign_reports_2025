  "description": "Tungsten Automation Power PDF JP2 File Parsing **Out-Of-Bounds Read** Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Tungsten Automation Power PDF. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of JP2 files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated object. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-24468.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-9751:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n- The vulnerability lies in the parsing of JP2 files within Tungsten Automation Power PDF.\n- The issue is caused by a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during JP2 file processing, leading to an out-of-bounds read.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Out-of-bounds Read:** The software reads data beyond the allocated memory buffer when processing a specially crafted JP2 file. This can lead to unexpected behavior, crashes, or other security issues.\n- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application fails to adequately validate data within the JP2 file, allowing a malicious file to cause an out-of-bounds read.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on a victim's system. This means they could potentially gain full control over the system, install malware, steal data, or perform other malicious actions.\n- **Context of the current process:** The code execution occurs in the context of the current user.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Malicious File:** An attacker can craft a malicious JP2 file and trick the victim into opening it using Tungsten Automation Power PDF.\n- **Malicious Web Page:** An attacker could host a malicious page that attempts to load the crafted JP2 file when the victim navigates to it.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- The attacker needs to be able to deliver a crafted JP2 file to the target user. This could involve sending it via email, hosting it on a malicious webpage, or through any means that results in a user opening the file in Tungsten Automation Power PDF.\n- The attack requires user interaction; specifically, the user must open the malicious file or visit a malicious page.",

The relationship here is that improper input validation can lead to an out-of-bounds read. **CWE-20** is a class-level CWE, while **CWE-125** is a base-level CWE, representing a more specific instance of the broader input validation issue.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n\n    cwe125 -->|CAUSED_BY| cwe20\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe125 primary\n    class cwe20 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **CWE-20: Improper Input Validation**. This **lack of proper validation** leads to **CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read**, ultimately resulting in Remote Code Execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis correctly identifies **CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read** as the primary weakness, supported by the vulnerability description stating: \"The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated object.\" The summary of CVE Reference Links content supports this by stating \"The issue is caused by a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during JP2 file processing, leading to an out-of-bounds read.\" The **lack of proper validation** (Improper Input Validation) enables the Out-of-Bounds Read.\n\nThe retriever results suggest **CWE-20: Improper Input Validation** as a candidate, but this is a class-level CWE. While **CWE-20** contributes to the vulnerability, **CWE-125** is a more precise description of the error. Therefore, **CWE-125** is the primary CWE, with **CWE-20** as a contributing factor. While **CWE-20** is discouraged, it is still useful as a secondary contributing factor.\n\nThe selection of **CWE-125** and **CWE-20** is at the optimal level of specificity, accurately representing the vulnerability's root cause and manifestation.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.

The relationship here is that improper input validation can lead to an out-of-bounds read. **CWE-20** is a class-level CWE, while **CWE-125** is a base-level CWE, representing a more specific instance of the broader input validation issue.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n\n    cwe125 -->|CAUSED_BY| cwe20\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe125 primary\n    class cwe20 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **CWE-20: Improper Input Validation**. This **lack of proper validation** leads to **CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read**, ultimately resulting in Remote Code Execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis correctly identifies **CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read** as the primary weakness, supported by the vulnerability description stating: \"The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated object.\" The summary of CVE Reference Links content supports this by stating \"The issue is caused by a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during JP2 file processing, leading to an out-of-bounds read.\" The **lack of proper validation** (Improper Input Validation) enables the Out-of-Bounds Read.\n\nThe retriever results suggest **CWE-20: Improper Input Validation** as a candidate, but this is a class-level CWE. While **CWE-20** contributes to the vulnerability, **CWE-125** is a more precise description of the error. Therefore, **CWE-125** is the primary CWE, with **CWE-20** as a contributing factor. While **CWE-20** is discouraged, it is still useful as a secondary contributing factor.\n\nThe selection of **CWE-125** and **CWE-20** is at the optimal level of specificity, accurately representing the vulnerability's root cause and manifestation.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
