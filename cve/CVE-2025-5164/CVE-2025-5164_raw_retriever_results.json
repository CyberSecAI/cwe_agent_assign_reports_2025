  "query": "A vulnerability has been found in PerfreeBlog 4.0.11 and classified as problematic. This vulnerability affects the function JwtUtil of the component JWT Handler. The manipulation leads to use of hard-coded cryptographic key . The attack can be initiated remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation appears to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",
