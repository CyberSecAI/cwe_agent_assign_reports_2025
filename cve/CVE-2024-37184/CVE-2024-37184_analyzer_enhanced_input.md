## Vulnerability Description
A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the adm.cgi rep_as_bridge() functionality of Wavlink AC3000 M33A8.V5030.210505. A specially crafted HTTP request can lead to **stack-based buffer overflow**. An attacker can make an authenticated HTTP request to trigger this vulnerability.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **stack-based buffer overflow**
- **vector:** specially crafted HTTP request
- **attacker:** authenticated attacker
- **product:** Wavlink AC3000
- **version:** M33A8.V5030.210505
- **component:** adm.cgi rep_as_bridge() functionality

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information extracted from the provided content:

**Content 1 (talosintelligence.com_38c8a43d_20250624_163649.html) and Content 2 (www.talosintelligence.com_cd6a7c48_20250624_163650.html):**

*   **Relates to CVE-2024-37184:** YES
*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `adm.cgi rep_as_bridge()` functionality due to the lack of input size validation when copying the `wl_rep_ssid2g` POST parameter to the stack.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-120).
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack vectors:** An attacker sends a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `adm.cgi` file, specifically manipulating the `wl_rep_ssid2g` parameter to trigger the overflow. The attacker must also pass the authentication check implemented in the `adm.cgi` binary.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Authenticated user of the web interface.
*   **Mitigation or fix:** The vendor has discontinued the product but is working on patches.
*   **More detail than the official CVE description:** Yes, this content provides a detailed technical analysis, including code snippets, crash information, and the exact function affected.
