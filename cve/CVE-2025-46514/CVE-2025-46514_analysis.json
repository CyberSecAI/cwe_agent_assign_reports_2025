CWE-352 is a compound weakness, while CWE-79 is a base weakness.

The primary weakness is the CSRF, which allows an attacker to force a user to perform actions. This action then results in Stored XSS.\n\nThe evidence for this is the **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases**:\n*   **weakness:** **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), XSS**\n\nGiven the provided information, assigning **CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** as the primary CWE is the most appropriate choice.
