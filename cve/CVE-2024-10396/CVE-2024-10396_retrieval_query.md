# Retrieval Query for CVE-2024-10396

## Vulnerability Description
An authenticated user can **provide a malformed ACL** to the fileservers StoreACL RPC, causing the fileserver to crash, possibly expose **uninitialized memory**, and possibly store garbage data in the audit log. Malformed ACLs provided in responses to client FetchACL RPCs can cause client processes to crash and possibly expose **uninitialized memory** into other ACLs stored on the server.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **uninitialized memory**
- **weakness:** **provide a malformed ACL**
- **impact:** crash and possibly expose uninitialized memory
- **vector:** malformed ACLs
- **attacker:** authenticated user
- **component:** StoreACL RPC and FetchACL RPCs

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause lies in the way the OpenAFS fileserver parses ACL strings provided by clients via the `RXAFS_StoreACL` and `RXAFS_OldStoreACL` RPCs. This parsing logic uses a combination of `sscanf()` and manual string examination, which is vulnerable to malformed ACL strings. The server expects newline characters to delimit ACL entries, but fails to properly handle missing null terminators, leading to out-of-bounds reads and potentially memory corruption.  Similar parsing issues exist within the client when processing ACLs received by the `RXAFS_FetchACL` RPC

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Out-of-bounds Read:** The fileserver can read beyond the allocated buffer for the ACL string if it's missing a null terminator. This can happen when searching for newlines.
*   **Use of Uninitialized Memory:** Out-of-bounds reads can expose uninitialized memory.
*   **Null Pointer Dereference:** The fileserver can attempt to dereference the address 0x1 if a null terminator is present after a malformed ACL line.
*   **Memory Leak:** If parsing errors occur after the first two lines of the ACL, the memory allocated for the parsed ACL is not freed.
*  **Logging of Garbage Data:** If the fileserver audit log is enabled and the ACL string does not contain a null terminator, it can log garbage to the audit log, potentially crashing the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Fileserver Crash (Denial of Service):** Malformed ACLs can lead to crashes due to segmentation faults or other errors, causing a denial of service.
*   **Memory Exhaustion:** Memory leaks can lead to the fileserver using up all available memory.
*   **Information Leak (Potentially):** Uninitialized memory could be written into the stored ACL, which could then be read back, potentially revealing sensitive data like other file contents or encryption keys.
*   **Client Crash:** Malformed ACLs in `RXAFS_FetchACL` responses can cause client processes to crash and potentially expose uninitialized memory.
*   **Garbage Data in Audit Logs:** Malformed ACLs can cause garbage data to be logged to the audit logs.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **`RXAFS_StoreACL` RPC:** An authenticated user with the ability to change ACLs can send a malformed ACL string to the fileserver, triggering the vulnerability.
*   **`RXAFS_FetchACL` RPC:** A malicious server can send a malformed ACL string to a client, triggering a crash on the client side.
*   **Audit Log:** A malformed ACL string can also crash the fileserver when it tries to write the string to the audit log. This is possible without any prior authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **For `RXAFS_StoreACL` Exploitation (Fileserver):**
    *   An attacker must be an authenticated user with permissions to change ACLs. This typically requires 'a' (administer) rights, membership in the `system:administrators` group, or ownership of the volume.
    *   They need the ability to send custom RPC requests, as standard OpenAFS tools cannot generate the required malformed ACLs.
*   **For `RXAFS_FetchACL` Exploitation (Client):**
     * A compromised or malicious server is required to send malformed ACLs back to clients.
*   **For Audit Log Exploitation:**
    * No authentication or special permissions are required as long as the audit log is enabled on the fileserver, and they must also have the capability to send custom RPC requests.

**Additional Notes:**

* The provided content gives more detail than the CVE description, explaining the vulnerability's technical aspects and specific attack vectors.
*   The advisory outlines mitigation strategies, including upgrading to patched versions of OpenAFS or disabling ACL changes/audit logging, in addition to the suggested patches.
*   It also mentions that client-side crashes due to `FetchACL` are generally limited to ephemeral user space processes.
* The CVSS scores are provided with slightly different impact based on various attack vectors.

In summary, this vulnerability allows an attacker to cause denial of service, memory leaks, and potentially leak sensitive data by sending malformed ACL strings to the OpenAFS fileserver. The same weakness in client-side ACL parsing may lead to denial of service and memory leaks on clients.

## CWE-457: Use of Uninitialized Variable
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The code uses a variable that has not been initialized, leading to unpredictable or unintended results.

### Extended Description
In some languages such as C and C++, stack variables are not initialized by default. They generally contain junk data with the contents of stack memory before the function was invoked. An attacker can sometimes control or read these contents. In other languages or conditions, a variable that is not explicitly initialized can be given a default value that has security implications, depending on the logic of the program. The presence of an uninitialized variable can sometimes indicate a typographic error in the code.

### Alternative Terms

## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.

### Extended Description


If the pointer contains an uninitialized value, then the value might not point to a valid memory location. This could cause the product to read from or write to unexpected memory locations, leading to a denial of service. If the uninitialized pointer is used as a function call, then arbitrary functions could be invoked. If an attacker can influence the portion of uninitialized memory that is contained in the pointer, this weakness could be leveraged to execute code or perform other attacks.


Depending on memory layout, associated memory management behaviors, and product operation, the attacker might be able to influence the contents of the uninitialized pointer, thus gaining more fine-grained control of the memory location to be accessed.

### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** There are close relationships between incorrect pointer dereferences and other weaknesses related to buffer operations. There may not be sufficient community agreement regarding these relationships. Further study is needed to determine when these relationships are chains, composites, perspective/layering, or other types of relationships. As of September 2010, most of the relationships are being captured as chains.

**[Terminology]** Many weaknesses related to pointer dereferences fall under the general term of "memory corruption" or "memory safety." As of September 2010, there is no commonly-used terminology that covers the lower-level variants.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2024-32878:** LLM product has a free of an uninitialized pointer
- **CVE-2010-0211:** chain: unchecked return value (CWE-252) leads to free of invalid, uninitialized pointer (CWE-824).
- **CVE-2009-2768:** Pointer in structure is not initialized, leading to NULL pointer dereference (CWE-476) and system crash.

### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This weakness is a major factor in a number of resultant weaknesses, especially in web applications that allow global variable initialization (such as PHP) with libraries that can be directly requested.

**[Research Gap]** It is highly likely that a large number of resultant weaknesses have missing initialization as a primary factor, but researcher reports generally do not provide this level of detail.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2020-6078:** Chain: The return value of a function returning a pointer is not checked for success (CWE-252) resulting in the later use of an uninitialized variable (CWE-456) and a null pointer dereference (CWE-476)
- **CVE-2009-2692:** Chain: Use of an unimplemented network socket operation pointing to an uninitialized handler function (CWE-456) causes a crash because of a null pointer dereference (CWE-476).
- **CVE-2020-20739:** A variable that has its value set in a conditional statement is sometimes used when the conditional fails, sometimes causing data leakage




## CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product does not check or incorrectly checks for unusual or exceptional conditions that are not expected to occur frequently during day to day operation of the product.

### Extended Description


The programmer may assume that certain events or conditions will never occur or do not need to be worried about, such as low memory conditions, lack of access to resources due to restrictive permissions, or misbehaving clients or components. However, attackers may intentionally trigger these unusual conditions, thus violating the programmer's assumptions, possibly introducing instability, incorrect behavior, or a vulnerability.


Note that this entry is not exclusively about the use of exceptions and exception handling, which are mechanisms for both checking and handling unusual or unexpected conditions.


### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-703
CanPrecede -> CWE-416

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Sometimes, when a return value can be used to indicate an error, an unchecked return value is a code-layer instance of a missing application-layer check for exceptional conditions. However, return values are not always needed to communicate exceptional conditions. For example, expiration of resources, values passed by reference, asynchronously modified data, sockets, etc. may indicate exceptional conditions without the use of a return value.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2023-49286:** Chain: function in web caching proxy does not correctly check a return value (CWE-253) leading to a reachable assertion (CWE-617)
- **CVE-2007-3798:** Unchecked return value leads to resultant integer overflow and code execution.
- **CVE-2006-4447:** Program does not check return value when invoking functions to drop privileges, which could leave users with higher privileges than expected by forcing those functions to fail.




## CWE-665: Improper Initialization
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not initialize or incorrectly initializes a resource, which might leave the resource in an unexpected state when it is accessed or used.

### Extended Description
This can have security implications when the associated resource is expected to have certain properties or values, such as a variable that determines whether a user has been authenticated or not.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-664

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2001-1471:** chain: an invalid value prevents a library file from being included, skipping initialization of key variables, leading to resultant eval injection.
- **CVE-2008-3637:** Improper error checking in protection mechanism produces an uninitialized variable, allowing security bypass and code execution.
- **CVE-2008-4197:** Use of uninitialized memory may allow code execution.
