  "description": "A vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, has been found in Enpass Password Manager up to 6.9.5 on Windows. This issue affects some unknown processing. The manipulation leads to **cleartext storage of sensitive information** in memory. An attack has to be approached locally. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation is known to be difficult. Upgrading to version 6.10.1 is able to address this issue. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n- The Enpass password manager, prior to version 6.11.3, stored selected user entries in plaintext within the application's process memory.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- **Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information:** The primary weakness is the storage of sensitive data (user credentials) in plaintext within memory. This violates the principle of least privilege and exposes the data to unauthorized access.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker who can access the memory of a user's machine could extract plaintext credentials, gaining unauthorized access to the user's accounts.\n- **Data Breach:** The attacker can potentially gain access to multiple accounts if the user has selected multiple entries.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- **Remote Access:** The attacker needs remote access to the user's host to perform memory extraction.\n- **Memory Dump:** The attacker needs to acquire a memory dump of the Enpass process, either through malware or other techniques.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- **Remote access** to the victim's system.\n- Ability to **dump process memory**.\n- The Enpass application must be **open and unlocked**.\n- The attacker must have the ability to **analyze the memory dump** to locate and extract the plaintext credentials.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The submitter notes that they reported the issue to the Enpass team on January 11, 2024, and it was fixed in version 6.11.3 (released September 12, 2024).\n- The issue was not explicitly mentioned in the Enpass release notes, which led to the submission for a CVE ID.\n- A similar vulnerability (CVE-2023-23349) was previously published by Kaspersky.\n- The submitter provides a link to their code on GitHub for extracting the credentials from the memory dump, as well as a video demonstration.",

The vulnerability involves storing sensitive information in cleartext, which directly matches the description of CWE-312. |\n| CWE-522 | Insufficiently Protected Credentials | 0.7 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary Candidate. The vulnerability involves storing credentials, but not encrypting them. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-312, which is a Base level CWE. CWE-522 is a Class-level CWE and a parent of CWE-523 (Unprotected Transport of Credentials). CWE-312 describes the specific issue of storing sensitive information in cleartext. CWE-522 is a broader classification that encompasses various ways credentials can be insufficiently protected, including cleartext storage.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    cwe523[\"CWE-523: Unprotected Transport of Credentials\"]\n\n    cwe312\n    cwe523 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe312 primary\n    class cwe522 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward: The application **stores sensitive information in cleartext (CWE-312)**. This leads to the **potential exposure of sensitive information** to unauthorized actors.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is the **cleartext storage of sensitive information**, which directly aligns with CWE-312. The vulnerability description key phrases and the CVE reference links content summary clearly indicate that sensitive information is stored in cleartext.\n\nThe retriever results listed CWE-312 as a candidate.\n\nCWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials) was considered, as the credentials were not sufficiently protected by encryption. However, CWE-312 is more specific and directly addresses the **cleartext storage** issue.\n\nThe evidence provided is strong, with clear indications of **cleartext storage of sensitive information** in the vulnerability description and the CVE reference. Therefore, CWE-312 is selected as the primary CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
