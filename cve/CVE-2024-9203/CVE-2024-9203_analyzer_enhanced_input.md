## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, has been found in Enpass Password Manager up to 6.9.5 on Windows. This issue affects some unknown processing. The manipulation leads to **cleartext storage of sensitive information** in memory. An attack has to be approached locally. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation is known to be difficult. Upgrading to version 6.10.1 is able to address this issue. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **cleartext storage of sensitive information**
- **weakness:** **cleartext storage of sensitive information in memory**
- **product:** Enpass Password Manager
- **version:** up to 6.9.5

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The Enpass password manager, prior to version 6.11.3, stored selected user entries in plaintext within the application's process memory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information:** The primary weakness is the storage of sensitive data (user credentials) in plaintext within memory. This violates the principle of least privilege and exposes the data to unauthorized access.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker who can access the memory of a user's machine could extract plaintext credentials, gaining unauthorized access to the user's accounts.
- **Data Breach:** The attacker can potentially gain access to multiple accounts if the user has selected multiple entries.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker needs remote access to the user's host to perform memory extraction.
- **Memory Dump:** The attacker needs to acquire a memory dump of the Enpass process, either through malware or other techniques.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Remote access** to the victim's system.
- Ability to **dump process memory**.
- The Enpass application must be **open and unlocked**.
- The attacker must have the ability to **analyze the memory dump** to locate and extract the plaintext credentials.

**Additional notes:**
- The submitter notes that they reported the issue to the Enpass team on January 11, 2024, and it was fixed in version 6.11.3 (released September 12, 2024).
- The issue was not explicitly mentioned in the Enpass release notes, which led to the submission for a CVE ID.
- A similar vulnerability (CVE-2023-23349) was previously published by Kaspersky.
- The submitter provides a link to their code on GitHub for extracting the credentials from the memory dump, as well as a video demonstration.
