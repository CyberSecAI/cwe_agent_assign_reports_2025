The resolution involved \"improved logic.\"\n\nThe primary CWE is CWE-20 [Improper Input Validation](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html), as the root cause is a **failure to properly validate input**. The evidence is the phrase \"**validation issue** was addressed with improved logic.\" This is a Class-level CWE, but given the limited information, it's the most appropriate.\n\nCWE-754 [Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/754.html) was considered because the validation issue may stem from a failure to check for exceptional conditions, however, it is not clearly indicated.\n\nThe retriever results indicated several CWEs related to memory safety (e.g., CWE-787 [Out-of-bounds Write](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/787.html), CWE-415 [Double Free](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/415.html)), but these are not supported by the provided evidence. The description only mentions a \"**validation issue**\", which is most directly related to input validation problems. The high scores of those candidates are likely false positives.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-843: Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates or initializes a resource such as a pointer, object, or variable using one type, but it later accesses that resource using a type that is incompatible with the original type.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-252: Unchecked Return Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not check the return value from a method or function, which can prevent it from detecting unexpected states and conditions.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
