However, including unexpected data in an HTTP header allows an attacker to specify the entirety of the HTTP message that is rendered by the client HTTP agent (e.g., web browser) or back-end HTTP agent (e.g., web server), whether the message is part of a request or a response. \n\n\nWhen an HTTP request contains unexpected CR and LF characters, the server may respond with an output stream that is interpreted as \"splitting\" the stream into two different HTTP messages instead of one. CR is carriage return, also given by %0d or \\r, and LF is line feed, also given by %0a or \\n.\n\n\nIn addition to CR and LF characters, other valid/RFC compliant special characters and unique character encodings can be utilized, such as HT (horizontal tab, also given by %09 or \\t) and SP (space, also given as + sign or %20).\n\n\nThese types of unvalidated and unexpected data in HTTP message headers allow an attacker to control the second \"split\" message to mount attacks such as server-side request forgery, cross-site scripting, and cache poisoning attacks.\n\n\nHTTP response splitting weaknesses may be present when:\n\n\n  1. Data enters a web application through an untrusted source, most frequently an HTTP request.\n\n  1. The data is included in an HTTP response header sent to a web user without neutralizing malicious characters that can be interpreted as separator characters for headers.\n\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-15811: Chain: Proxy uses a substring search instead of parsing the Transfer-Encoding header (CWE-697), allowing request splitting (CWE-113) and cache poisoning\n\n- CVE-2021-41084: Scala-based HTTP interface allows request splitting and response splitting through header names, header values, status reasons, and URIs\n\n- CVE-2018-12116: Javascript-based framework allows request splitting through a path option of an HTTP request\n\n- CVE-2004-2146: Application accepts CRLF in an object ID, allowing HTTP response splitting.\n\n- CVE-2004-1656: Shopping cart allows HTTP response splitting to perform HTML injection via CRLF in a parameter for a url\n\n- CVE-2005-2060: Bulletin board allows response splitting via CRLF in parameter.\n\n- CVE-2004-2512: Response splitting via CRLF in PHPSESSID.\n\n- CVE-2005-1951: e-commerce app allows HTTP response splitting using CRLF in object id parameters\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-0268: An Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Response Splitting') weakness in J-web of Juniper Networks Junos OS leads to buffer overflows, segment faults, or other impacts, which allows an attacker to modify the integrity of the device and exfiltration information from the device without authentication. The weakness can be exploited to facilitate cross-site scripting (XSS), cookie manipulation (modifying session cookies, stealing cookies) and more. This weakness can also be exploited by directing a user to a seemingly legitimate link from the affected site. The attacker requires no special access or permissions to the device to carry out such attacks. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS: 18.1 versions prior to 18.1R3-S11; 18.2 versions prior to 18.2R3-S5; 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R2-S4, 18.3R3-S3; 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R2-S5, 18.4R3-S3; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R2-S2, 19.1R3-S2; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S5, 19.2R2; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R3; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R1-S3, 19.4R2, 19.4R3; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R1-S2, 20.1R2. This issue does not affect Juniper Networks Junos OS versions prior to 18.1R1.\n\n- CVE-2021-28979: SafeNet KeySecure Management Console 8.12.0 is vulnerable to HTTP response splitting attacks. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using specially-crafted URL to cause the server to return a split response, once the URL is clicked.\n\n- CVE-2021-41084: http4s is an open source scala interface for HTTP. In affected versions http4s is vulnerable to response-splitting or request-splitting attacks when untrusted user input is used to create any of the following fields: Header names (`Header.name`\u00e5), Header values (`Header.value`), Status reason phrases (`Status.reason`), URI paths (`Uri.Path`), URI authority registered names (`URI.RegName`) (through 0.21). This issue has been resolved in versions 0.21.30, 0.22.5, 0.23.4, and 1.0.0-M27 perform the following. As a matter of practice http4s services and client applications should sanitize any user input in the aforementioned fields before returning a request or response to the backend. The carriage return, newline, and null characters are the most threatening.\n\n- CVE-2021-45818: SAFARI Montage 8.7.32 is affected by a CRLF injection vulnerability which can lead to HTTP response splitting.\n\n- CVE-2021-33621: The cgi gem before 0.1.0.2, 0.2.x before 0.2.2, and 0.3.x before 0.3.5 for Ruby allows HTTP response splitting. This is relevant to applications that use untrusted user input either to generate an HTTP response or to create a CGI::Cookie object.\n\n- CVE-2021-40336: A vulnerability exists in the http web interface where the web interface does not validate data in an HTTP header. This causes a possible HTTP response splitting, which if exploited could lead an attacker to channel down harmful code into the user\u2019s web browser, such as to steal the session cookies. Thus, an attacker who successfully makes an MSM user who has already established a session to MSM web interface clicks a forged link to the MSM web interface, e.g., the link is sent per E-Mail, could trick the user into downloading malicious software onto his computer. This issue affects: Hitachi Energy MSM V2.2 and prior versions.\n\n- CVE-2021-41437: An HTTP response splitting attack in web application in ASUS RT-AX88U before v3.0.0.4.388.20558 allows an attacker to craft a specific URL that if an authenticated victim visits it, the URL will give access to the cloud storage of the attacker.\n\n- CVE-2022-20772: A vulnerability in Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA) and Cisco Secure Email and Web Manager could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct an HTTP response splitting attack. This vulnerability is due to the failure of the application or its environment to properly sanitize input values. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious HTTP headers, controlling the response body, or splitting the response into multiple responses.\n\n- CVE-2022-35507: A response-header CRLF injection vulnerability in the Proxmox Virtual Environment (PVE) and Proxmox Mail Gateway (PMG) web interface allows a remote attacker to set cookies for a victim's browser that are longer than the server expects, causing a client-side DoS. This affects Chromium-based browsers because they allow injection of response headers with %0d. This is fixed in pve-http-server 4.1-3.\n\n- CVE-2022-37240: MDaemon Technologies SecurityGateway for Email Servers 8.5.2 is vulnerable to HTTP Response splitting via the format parameter.\n\n- CVE-2022-37242: MDaemon Technologies SecurityGateway for Email Servers 8.5.2, is vulnerable to HTTP Response splitting via the data parameter.\n\n- CVE-2022-37953: An HTTP response splitting vulnerability exists in the AM Gateway Challenge-Response dialog of WorkstationST (<v07.09.15) and could allow an attacker to compromise a victim's browser/session. WorkstationST is only deployed in specific, controlled environments rendering attack complexity significantly higher than if the attack were conducted on the software in isolation. WorkstationST v07.09.15 can be found in ControlST v07.09.07 SP8 and greater.\n\n- CVE-2022-42471: An improper neutralization of CRLF sequences in HTTP headers ('HTTP Response Splitting') vulnerability [CWE-113] In FortiWeb version 7.0.0 through 7.0.2, FortiWeb version 6.4.0 through 6.4.2, FortiWeb version 6.3.6 through 6.3.20 may allow an authenticated and remote attacker to inject arbitrary headers.\n\n- CVE-2022-42472: A improper neutralization of crlf sequences in http headers ('http response splitting') in Fortinet FortiOS versions 7.2.0 through 7.2.2, 7.0.0 through 7.0.8, 6.4.0 through 6.4.11, 6.2.0 through 6.2.12, 6.0.0 through 6.0.16, FortiProxy 7.2.0 through 7.2.1, 7.0.0 through 7.0.7, 2.0.0 through 2.0.10, 1.2.0 through 1.2.13, 1.1.0 through 1.1.6 may allow an authenticated and remote attacker to perform an HTTP request splitting attack which gives attackers control of the remaining headers and body of the response.\n\n- CVE-2022-47052: The web interface of the 'Nighthawk R6220 AC1200 Smart Wi-Fi Router' is vulnerable to a CRLF Injection attack that can be leveraged to perform Reflected XSS and HTML Injection. A malicious unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability using a specially crafted URL. This affects firmware versions: V1.1.0.112_1.0.1, V1.1.0.114_1.0.1.\n\n- CVE-2021-37499: CRLF vulnerability in Reprise License Manager (RLM) web interface through 14.2BL4 in the password parameter in View License Result function, that allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary HTTP headers.\n\n- CVE-2022-32453: HTTP header injection vulnerability in Cybozu Office 10.0.0 to 10.8.5 may allow a remote attacker to obtain and/or alter the data of the product via unspecified vectors.\n\n- CVE-2022-3918: A program using FoundationNetworking in swift-corelibs-foundation is potentially vulnerable to CRLF ( ) injection in URLRequest headers. In this vulnerability, a client can insert one or several CRLF sequences into a URLRequest header value. When that request is sent via URLSession to an HTTP server, the server may interpret the content after the CRLF as extra headers, or even a second request. For example, consider a URLRequest to http://example.com/ with the GET method. Suppose we set the URLRequest header \"Foo\" to the value \"Bar Extra-Header: Added GET /other HTTP/1.1\". When this request is sent, it will appear to the server as two requests: GET / HTTP/1.1 Foo: Bar Extra-Header: Added GET /other HTTP/1.1 In this manner, the client is able to inject extra headers and craft an entirely new request to a separate path, despite only making one API call in URLSession. If a developer has total control over the request and its headers, this vulnerability may not pose a threat. However, this vulnerability escalates if un-sanitized user input is placed in header values. If so, a malicious user could inject new headers or requests to an intermediary or backend server. Developers should be especially careful to sanitize user input in this case, or upgrade their version of swift-corelibs-foundation to include the patch below.\n\n- CVE-2022-4188: Insufficient validation of untrusted input in CORS in Google Chrome on Android prior to 108.0.5359.71 allowed a remote attacker to bypass same origin policy via a crafted HTML page.

It is the lack of verification of these assumptions for user-controlled input that leads to injection problems. Injection problems encompass a wide variety of issues -- all mitigated in very different ways and usually attempted in order to alter the control flow of the process. For this reason, the most effective way to discuss these weaknesses is to note the distinct features that classify them as injection weaknesses. The most important issue to note is that all injection problems share one thing in common -- i.e., they allow for the injection of control plane data into the user-controlled data plane. This means that the execution of the process may be altered by sending code in through legitimate data channels, using no other mechanism. While buffer overflows, and many other flaws, involve the use of some further issue to gain execution, injection problems need only for the data to be parsed.\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2024-5184: API service using a large generative AI model allows direct prompt injection to leak hard-coded system prompts or execute other prompts.\n\n- CVE-2022-36069: Python-based dependency management tool avoids OS command injection when generating Git commands but allows injection of optional arguments with input beginning with a dash (CWE-88), potentially allowing for code execution.\n\n- CVE-1999-0067: Canonical example of OS command injection.

However, this would cause confusion with \"Cascading Style Sheets,\" so usage of this acronym has declined significantly.\n\nDescription:\n\nThe product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.\n\nExtended Details:\n\n\n\nCross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:\n\n\n  1. Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.\n\n  1. The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.\n\n  1. During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.\n\n  1. A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.\n\n  1. Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.\n\n  1. This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.\n\nThere are three main kinds of XSS:\n\n  -  **Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent)**  - The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.\n\n  -  **Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent)**  - The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs. \n\n  -  **Type 0: DOM-Based XSS**  - In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible. \n\nOnce the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"\n\nIn many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-25926: Python Library Manager did not sufficiently neutralize a user-supplied search term, allowing reflected XSS.\n\n- CVE-2021-25963: Python-based e-commerce platform did not escape returned content on error pages, allowing for reflected Cross-Site Scripting attacks.\n\n- CVE-2021-1879: Universal XSS in mobile operating system, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2020-3580: Chain: improper input validation (CWE-20) in firewall product leads to XSS (CWE-79), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2014-8958: Admin GUI allows XSS through cookie.\n\n- CVE-2017-9764: Web stats program allows XSS through crafted HTTP header.\n\n- CVE-2014-5198: Web log analysis product allows XSS through crafted HTTP Referer header.\n\n- CVE-2008-5080: Chain: protection mechanism failure allows XSS\n\n- CVE-2006-4308: Chain: incomplete denylist (CWE-184) only checks \"javascript:\" tag, allowing XSS (CWE-79) using other tags\n\n- CVE-2007-5727: Chain: incomplete denylist (CWE-184) only removes SCRIPT tags, enabling XSS (CWE-79)\n\n- CVE-2008-5770: Reflected XSS using the PATH_INFO in a URL\n\n- CVE-2008-4730: Reflected XSS not properly handled when generating an error message\n\n- CVE-2008-5734: Reflected XSS sent through email message.\n\n- CVE-2008-0971: Stored XSS in a security product.\n\n- CVE-2008-5249: Stored XSS using a wiki page.\n\n- CVE-2006-3568: Stored XSS in a guestbook application.\n\n- CVE-2006-3211: Stored XSS in a guestbook application using a javascript: URI in a bbcode img tag.\n\n- CVE-2006-3295: Chain: library file is not protected against a direct request (CWE-425), leading to reflected XSS (CWE-79).\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-7050: Codologic Codoforum through 4.8.4 allows a DOM-based XSS. While creating a new topic as a normal user, it is possible to add a poll that is automatically loaded in the DOM once the thread/topic is opened. Because session cookies lack the HttpOnly flag, it is possible to steal authentication cookies and take over accounts.\n\n- CVE-2020-7051: Codologic Codoforum through 4.8.4 allows stored XSS in the login area. This is relevant in conjunction with CVE-2020-5842 because session cookies lack the HttpOnly flag. The impact is account takeover.\n\n- CVE-2021-1543: Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business 220 Series Smart Switches could allow an attacker to do the following: Hijack a user session Execute arbitrary commands as a root user on the underlying operating system Conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack Conduct an HTML injection attack For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2021-21260: Online Invoicing System (OIS) is open source software which is a lean invoicing system for small businesses, consultants and freelancers created using AppGini. In OIS version 4.0 there is a stored XSS which can enables an attacker takeover of the admin account through a payload that extracts a csrf token and sends a request to change password. It has been found that Item description is reflected without sanitization in app/items_view.php which enables the malicious scenario.\n\n- CVE-2021-21283: Flarum is an open source discussion platform for websites. The \"Flarum Sticky\" extension versions 0.1.0-beta.14 and 0.1.0-beta.15 has a cross-site scripting vulnerability. A change in release beta 14 of the Sticky extension caused the plain text content of the first post of a pinned discussion to be injected as HTML on the discussion list. The issue was discovered following an internal audit. Any HTML would be injected through the m.trust() helper. This resulted in an HTML injection where <script> tags would not be executed. However it was possible to run javascript from other HTML attributes, enabling a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack to be performed. Since the exploit only happens with the first post of a pinned discussion, an attacker would need the ability to pin their own discussion, or be able to edit a discussion that was previously pinned. On forums where all pinned posts are authored by your staff, you can be relatively certain the vulnerability has not been exploited. Forums where some user-created discussions were pinned can look at the first post edit date to find whether the vulnerability might have been exploited. Because Flarum doesn't store the post content history, you cannot be certain if a malicious edit was reverted. The fix will be available in version v0.1.0-beta.16 with Flarum beta 16. The fix has already been back-ported to Flarum beta 15 as version v0.1.0-beta.15.1 of the Sticky extension. Forum administrators can disable the Sticky extension until they are able to apply the update. The vulnerability cannot be exploited while the extension is disabled.\n\n- CVE-2021-21332: Synapse is a Matrix reference homeserver written in python (pypi package matrix-synapse). Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and VoIP. In Synapse before version 1.27.0, the password reset endpoint served via Synapse was vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. The impact depends on the configuration of the domain that Synapse is deployed on, but may allow access to cookies and other browser data, CSRF vulnerabilities, and access to other resources served on the same domain or parent domains. This is fixed in version 1.27.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-22223: Client-Side code injection through Feature Flag name in GitLab CE/EE starting with 11.9 allows a specially crafted feature flag name to PUT requests on behalf of other users via clicking on a link\n\n- CVE-2021-22722: A CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Stored Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability exists in EVlink City (EVC1S22P4 / EVC1S7P4 all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1), EVlink Parking (EVW2 / EVF2 / EV.2 all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1), and EVlink Smart Wallbox (EVB1A all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1 ) that could cause code injection when importing a CSV file or changing station parameters.\n\n- CVE-2021-22723: A CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation (Cross-siteScripting) through Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in EVlink City (EVC1S22P4 / EVC1S7P4 all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1), EVlink Parking (EVW2 / EVF2 / EV.2 all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1), and EVlink Smart Wallbox (EVB1A all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1 ) that could allow an attacker to impersonate the user who manages the charging station or carry out actions on their behalf when crafted malicious parameters are submitted to the charging station web server.\n\n- CVE-2021-24301: The Hotjar Connecticator WordPress plugin through 1.1.1 is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the 'hotjar script' textarea. The request did include a CSRF nonce that was properly verified by the server and this vulnerability could only be exploited by administrator users.\n\n- CVE-2021-24891: The Elementor Website Builder WordPress plugin before 3.4.8 does not sanitise or escape user input appended to the DOM via a malicious hash, resulting in a DOM Cross-Site Scripting issue.\n\n- CVE-2021-25955: In \u201cDolibarr ERP CRM\u201d, WYSIWYG Editor module, v2.8.1 to v13.0.2 are affected by a stored XSS vulnerability that allows low privileged application users to store malicious scripts in the \u201cPrivate Note\u201d field at \u201c/adherents/note.php?id=1\u201d endpoint. These scripts are executed in a victim\u2019s browser when they open the page containing the vulnerable field. In the worst case, the victim who inadvertently triggers the attack is a highly privileged administrator. The injected scripts can extract the Session ID, which can lead to full Account takeover of the admin and due to other vulnerability (Improper Access Control on Private notes) a low privileged user can update the private notes which could lead to privilege escalation.\n\n- CVE-2021-26929: An XSS issue was discovered in Horde Groupware Webmail Edition through 5.2.22 (where the Horde_Text_Filter library before 2.3.7 is used). The attacker can send a plain text e-mail message, with JavaScript encoded as a link or email that is mishandled by preProcess in Text2html.php, because bespoke use of \\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00 and \\\\x01\\\\x01\\\\x01 interferes with XSS defenses.\n\n- CVE-2021-29208: A remote dom xss, crlf injection vulnerability was discovered in HPE Integrated Lights-Out 4 (iLO 4); HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen9; HPE Integrated Lights-Out 5 (iLO 5) for HPE Gen10 Servers; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10; HPE SimpliVity 2600; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10 G; HPE SimpliVity 325; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10 H version(s): Prior to version 2.78.\n\n- CVE-2021-29209: A remote dom xss, crlf injection vulnerability was discovered in HPE Integrated Lights-Out 4 (iLO 4); HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen9; HPE Integrated Lights-Out 5 (iLO 5) for HPE Gen10 Servers; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10; HPE SimpliVity 2600; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10 G; HPE SimpliVity 325; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10 H version(s): Prior to version 2.78.\n\n- CVE-2021-29210: A remote dom xss, crlf injection vulnerability was discovered in HPE Integrated Lights-Out 4 (iLO 4); HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen9; HPE Integrated Lights-Out 5 (iLO 5) for HPE Gen10 Servers; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10; HPE SimpliVity 2600; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10 G; HPE SimpliVity 325; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10 H version(s): Prior to version 2.78.\n\n- CVE-2021-29459: XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. It is possible to persistently inject scripts in XWiki versions prior to 12.6.3 and 12.8. Unregistred users can fill simple text fields. Registered users can fill in their personal information and (if they have edit rights) fill the values of static lists using App Within Minutes. There is no easy workaround except upgrading XWiki. The vulnerability has been patched on XWiki 12.8 and 12.6.3.\n\n- CVE-2021-32772: Poddycast is a podcast app made with Electron. Prior to version 0.8.1, an attacker can create a podcast or episode with malicious characters and execute commands on the client machine. The application does not clean the HTML characters of the podcast information obtained from the Feed, which allows the injection of HTML and JS code (cross-site scripting). Being an application made in electron, cross-site scripting can be scaled to remote code execution, making it possible to execute commands on the machine where the application is running. The vulnerability is patched in Poddycast version 0.8.1.\n\n- CVE-2021-34656: The 2Way VideoCalls and Random Chat - HTML5 Webcam Videochat WordPress plugin is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the `vws_notice` function found in the ~/inc/requirements.php file which allows attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts, in versions up to and including 5.2.7.\n\n- CVE-2021-34763: Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software could allow an attacker to execute a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack or an open redirect attack. For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2021-34821: Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in AAT Novus Management System through 1.51.2. The WebUI has wrong HTTP 404 error handling implemented. A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to exploit the issue by sending malicious HTTP requests to non-existing URIs. The value of the URL path filename is copied into the HTML document as plain text tags.\n\n- CVE-2021-3529: A flaw was found in noobaa-core in versions before 5.7.0. This flaw results in the name of an arbitrarily URL being copied into an HTML document as plain text between tags, including potentially a payload script. The input was echoed unmodified in the application response, resulting in arbitrary JavaScript being injected into an application's response. The highest threat to the system is for confidentiality, availability, and integrity.\n\n- CVE-2021-39186: GlobalNewFiles is a MediaWiki extension maintained by Miraheze. Prior to commit number cee254e1b158cdb0ddbea716b1d3edc31fa4fb5d, the username column of the GlobalNewFiles special page is vulnerable to a stored XSS. Commit number cee254e1b158cdb0ddbea716b1d3edc31fa4fb5d contains a patch. As a workaround, one may disallow <,> (or other characters required to insert html/js) from being used in account names so an XSS is not possible.\n\n- CVE-2021-37541: In JetBrains Hub before 2021.1.13402, HTML injection in the password reset email was possible.\n\n- CVE-2021-34419: In the Zoom Client for Meetings for Ubuntu Linux before version 5.1.0, there is an HTML injection flaw when sending a remote control request to a user in the process of in-meeting screen sharing. This could allow meeting participants to be targeted for social engineering attacks.\n\n- CVE-2021-30057: A stored HTML injection vulnerability exists in Knowage Suite version 7.1. An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML in \"/restful-services/2.0/analyticalDrivers\" via the 'LABEL' and 'NAME' parameters.\n\n- CVE-2021-22232: HTML injection was possible via the full name field before versions 13.11.6, 13.12.6, and 14.0.2 in GitLab CE\n\n- CVE-2020-23050: TAO Open Source Assessment Platform v3.3.0 RC02 was discovered to contain a HTML injection vulnerability in the userFirstName parameter of the user account input field. This vulnerability allows attackers to execute phishing attacks, external redirects, and arbitrary code.\n\n- CVE-2021-39348: The LearnPress WordPress plugin is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting due to insufficient escaping on the $custom_profile parameter found in the ~/inc/admin/views/backend-user-profile.php file which allowed attackers with administrative user access to inject arbitrary web scripts, in versions up to and including 4.1.3.1. This affects multi-site installations where unfiltered_html is disabled for administrators, and sites where unfiltered_html is disabled. Please note that this is seperate from CVE-2021-24702.\n\n- CVE-2021-21333: Synapse is a Matrix reference homeserver written in python (pypi package matrix-synapse). Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and VoIP. In Synapse before version 1.27.0, the notification emails sent for notifications for missed messages or for an expiring account are subject to HTML injection. In the case of the notification for missed messages, this could allow an attacker to insert forged content into the email. The account expiry feature is not enabled by default and the HTML injection is not controllable by an attacker. This is fixed in version 1.27.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-42663: An HTML injection vulnerability exists in Sourcecodester Online Event Booking and Reservation System in PHP/MySQL via the msg parameter to /event-management/index.php. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability in order to change the visibility of the website. Once the target user clicks on a given link he will display the content of the HTML code of the attacker's choice.\n\n- CVE-2021-41248: GraphiQL is the reference implementation of this monorepo, GraphQL IDE, an official project under the GraphQL Foundation. All versions of graphiql older than graphiql@1.4.7 are vulnerable to compromised HTTP schema introspection responses or schema prop values with malicious GraphQL type names, exposing a dynamic XSS attack surface that can allow code injection on operation autocomplete. In order for the attack to take place, the user must load a vulnerable schema in graphiql. There are a number of ways that can occur. By default, the schema URL is not attacker-controllable in graphiql or in its suggested implementations or examples, leaving only very complex attack vectors. If a custom implementation of graphiql's fetcher allows the schema URL to be set dynamically, such as a URL query parameter like ?endpoint= in graphql-playground, or a database provided value, then this custom graphiql implementation is vulnerable to phishing attacks, and thus much more readily available, low or no privelege level xss attacks. The URLs could look like any generic looking graphql schema URL. It should be noted that desktop clients such as Altair, Insomnia, Postwoman, do not appear to be impacted by this. This vulnerability does not impact codemirror-graphql, monaco-graphql or other dependents, as it exists in onHasCompletion.ts in graphiql. It does impact all forks of graphiql, and every released version of graphiql.\n\n- CVE-2021-41249: GraphQL Playground is a GraphQL IDE for development of graphQL focused applications. All versions of graphql-playground-react older than graphql-playground-react@1.7.28 are vulnerable to compromised HTTP schema introspection responses or schema prop values with malicious GraphQL type names, exposing a dynamic XSS attack surface that can allow code injection on operation autocomplete. In order for the attack to take place, the user must load a malicious schema in graphql-playground. There are several ways this can occur, including by specifying the URL to a malicious schema in the endpoint query parameter. If a user clicks on a link to a GraphQL Playground installation that specifies a malicious server, arbitrary JavaScript can run in the user's browser, which can be used to exfiltrate user credentials or other harmful goals. If you are using graphql-playground-react directly in your client app, upgrade to version 1.7.28 or later.\n\n- CVE-2021-41825: Verint Workforce Optimization (WFO) 15.2.5.1033 allows HTML injection via the /wfo/control/signin username parameter.\n\n- CVE-2021-42564: An open redirect through HTML injection in confidential messages in Cryptshare before 5.1.0 allows remote attackers (with permission to provide confidential messages via Cryptshare) to redirect targeted victims to any URL via the '<meta http-equiv=\"refresh\"' substring in the editor parameter.\n\n- CVE-2021-43683: pictshare v1.5 is affected by a Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in api/info.php. The exit function will terminate the script and print the message which has $_REQUEST['hash'].\n\n- CVE-2021-31682: The login portal for the Automated Logic WebCTRL/WebCTRL OEM web application contains a vulnerability that allows for reflected XSS attacks due to the operatorlocale GET parameter not being sanitized. This issue impacts versions 6.5 and below. This issue works by passing in a basic XSS payload to a vulnerable GET parameter that is reflected in the output without sanitization.\n\n- CVE-2021-21313: GLPI is open source software which stands for Gestionnaire Libre de Parc Informatique and it is a Free Asset and IT Management Software package. In GLPI before verison 9.5.4, there is a vulnerability in the /ajax/common.tabs.php endpoint, indeed, at least two parameters _target and id are not properly sanitized. Here are two payloads (due to two different exploitations depending on which parameter you act) to exploit the vulnerability:/ajax/common.tabs.php?_target=javascript:alert(document.cookie)&_itemtype=DisplayPreference&_glpi_tab=DisplayPreference$2&id=258&displaytype=Ticket (Payload triggered if you click on the button). /ajax/common.tabs.php?_target=/front/ticket.form.php&_itemtype=Ticket&_glpi_tab=Ticket$1&id=(){};(function%20(){alert(document.cookie);})();function%20a&#.\n\n- CVE-2021-39175: HedgeDoc is a platform to write and share markdown. In versions prior to 1.9.0, an unauthenticated attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript into the speaker-notes of the slide-mode feature by embedding an iframe hosting the malicious code into the slides or by embedding the HedgeDoc instance into another page. The problem is patched in version 1.9.0. There are no known workarounds aside from upgrading.\n\n- CVE-2021-42117: Insufficient Input Validation in Web Applications operating on Business-DNA Solutions GmbH\u2019s TopEase\u00ae Platform Version <= 7.1.27 allows an authenticated remote attacker with Object Modification privileges to insert arbitrary HTML without code execution.\n\n- CVE-2020-4520: IBM Cognos Analytics 11.0 and 11.1 could allow a remote attacker to inject malicious HTML code that when viewed by the authenticated victim would execute the code.

The injected payload is reflected on the affiliate main page for all authenticated and unauthenticated visitors.\n\n- CVE-2021-32750: MuWire is a file publishing and networking tool that protects the identity of its users by using I2P technology. Users of MuWire desktop client prior to version 0.8.8 can be de-anonymized by an attacker who knows their full ID. An attacker could send a message with a subject line containing a URL with an HTML image tag and the MuWire client would try to fetch that image via clearnet, thus exposing the IP address of the user. The problem is fixed in MuWire 0.8.8. As a workaround, users can disable messaging functionality to prevent other users from sending them malicious messages.\n\n- CVE-2021-42367: The Variation Swatches for WooCommerce WordPress plugin is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via several parameters found in the ~/includes/class-menu-page.php file which allows attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts, in versions up to and including 2.1.1.

Argo CD starting with 2.3.0 and prior to 2.3.6 and 2.4.5 is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting (XSS) bug which could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript in the `/auth/callback` page in a victim's browser. This vulnerability only affects Argo CD instances which have single sign on (SSO) enabled. The exploit also assumes the attacker has 1) access to the API server's encryption key, 2) a method to add a cookie to the victim's browser, and 3) the ability to convince the victim to visit a malicious `/auth/callback` link. The vulnerability is classified as low severity because access to the API server's encryption key already grants a high level of access. Exploiting the XSS would allow the attacker to impersonate the victim, but would not grant any privileges which the attacker could not otherwise gain using the encryption key. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in the following Argo CD versions 2.4.5 and 2.3.6. There is currently no known workaround.\n\n- CVE-2022-3242: Code Injection in GitHub repository microweber/microweber prior to 1.3.2.\n\n- CVE-2022-32763: A cross-site scripting (xss) sanitization vulnerability bypass exists in the SanitizeHtml functionality of Lansweeper lansweeper 10.1.1.0.

The victim's encrypted password can be stolen and most likely be decrypted.\n\n- CVE-2022-45004: Gophish through 0.12.1 was discovered to contain a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability via a crafted landing page.\n\n- CVE-2022-45411: Cross-Site Tracing occurs when a server will echo a request back via the Trace method, allowing an XSS attack to access to authorization headers and cookies inaccessible to JavaScript (such as cookies protected by HTTPOnly). To mitigate this attack, browsers placed limits on <code>fetch()</code> and XMLHttpRequest; however some webservers have implemented non-standard headers such as <code>X-Http-Method-Override</code> that override the HTTP method, and made this attack possible again. Thunderbird has applied the same mitigations to the use of this and similar headers. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 102.5, Thunderbird < 102.5, and Firefox < 107.\n\n- CVE-2022-39207: Onedev is an open source, self-hosted Git Server with CI/CD and Kanban. During CI/CD builds, it is possible to save build artifacts for later retrieval. They can be accessed through OneDev's web UI after the successful run of a build. These artifact files are served by the webserver in the same context as the UI without any further restrictions. This leads to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) when a user creates a build artifact that contains HTML. When accessing the artifact, the content is rendered by the browser, including any JavaScript that it contains. Since all cookies (except for the rememberMe one) do not set the HttpOnly flag, an attacker could steal the session of a victim and use it to impersonate them. To exploit this issue, attackers need to be able to modify the content of artifacts, which usually means they need to be able to modify a project's build spec. The exploitation requires the victim to click on an attacker's link. It can be used to elevate privileges by targeting admins of a OneDev instance. In the worst case, this can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server, because admins can create Server Shell Executors and use them to run any command on the server. This issue has been patched in version 7.3.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-3033: If a Thunderbird user replied to a crafted HTML email containing a <code>meta</code> tag, with the <code>meta</code> tag having the <code>http-equiv=\"refresh\"</code> attribute, and the content attribute specifying an URL, then Thunderbird started a network request to that URL, regardless of the configuration to block remote content. In combination with certain other HTML elements and attributes in the email, it was possible to execute JavaScript code included in the message in the context of the message compose document. The JavaScript code was able to perform actions including, but probably not limited to, read and modify the contents of the message compose document, including the quoted original message, which could potentially contain the decrypted plaintext of encrypted data in the crafted email. The contents could then be transmitted to the network, either to the URL specified in the META refresh tag, or to a different URL, as the JavaScript code could modify the URL specified in the document. This bug doesn't affect users who have changed the default Message Body display setting to 'simple html' or 'plain text'. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 102.2.1 and Thunderbird < 91.13.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-29444: Plugin Settings Change leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Cloudways Breeze plugin <= 2.0.2 on WordPress allows users with a subscriber or higher user role to execute any of the wp_ajax_* actions in the class Breeze_Configuration which includes the ability to change any of the plugin's settings including CDN setting which could be further used for XSS attack.\n\n- CVE-2021-36176: Multiple uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerabilities in the web interface of FortiPortal before 6.0.6 may allow a single low-privileged user to induce a denial of service via multiple HTTP requests.\n\n- CVE-2021-43929: Improper neutralization of special elements in output used by a downstream component ('Injection') vulnerability in work flow management in Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM) before 7.0.1-42218-2 allows remote authenticated users to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via unspecified vectors.\n\n- CVE-2022-2178: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in Saysis Computer Starcities allows Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).This issue affects Starcities: before 1.1. \n\n- CVE-2022-38628: Nortek Linear eMerge E3-Series 0.32-08f, 0.32-07p, 0.32-07e, 0.32-09c, 0.32-09b, 0.32-09a, and 0.32-08e were discovered to contain a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability which is chained with a local session fixation.

An attacker is able to inject arbitrary `CSS` into the generated graph allowing them to change the styling of elements outside of the generated graph, and potentially exfiltrate sensitive information by using specially crafted `CSS` selectors. The following example shows how an attacker can exfiltrate the contents of an input field by bruteforcing the `value` attribute one character at a time. Whenever there is an actual match, an `http` request will be made by the browser in order to \"load\" a background image that will let an attacker know what's the value of the character. This issue may lead to `Information Disclosure` via CSS selectors and functions able to generate HTTP requests. This also allows an attacker to change the document in ways which may lead a user to perform unintended actions, such as clicking on a link, etc. This issue has been resolved in version 9.1.3.

These special elements can carry control implications. If product does not prevent external control or influence over the inclusion of such special elements, the control flow of the program may be altered from what was intended. For example, both Unix and Windows interpret the symbol < (\"less than\") as meaning \"read input from a file\".\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2001-0677: Read arbitrary files from mail client by providing a special MIME header that is internally used to store pathnames for attachments.\n\n- CVE-2000-0703: Setuid program does not cleanse special escape sequence before sending data to a mail program, causing the mail program to process those sequences.\n\n- CVE-2003-0020: Multi-channel issue. Terminal escape sequences not filtered from log files.\n\n- CVE-2003-0083: Multi-channel issue. Terminal escape sequences not filtered from log files.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-33592: NAVER Toolbar before 4.0.30.323 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted upgrade.xml file. Special characters in filename parameter can be the cause of bypassing code signing check function.\n\n- CVE-2022-0661: The Ad Injection WordPress plugin through 1.2.0.19 does not properly sanitize the body of the adverts injected into the pages, allowing a high privileged user (Admin+) to inject arbitrary HTML or javascript even with unfiltered_html disallowed, leading to a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Further it is also possible to inject PHP code, leading to a Remote Code execution (RCE) vulnerability, even if the DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT and DISALLOW_FILE_MOD constants are both set.\n\n- CVE-2022-35651: A stored XSS and blind SSRF vulnerability was found in Moodle, occurs due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied data in the SCORM track details.

This could allow an authenticated remote attacker with administrative privileges to inject code and lead to a DOM-based XSS.\n\n- CVE-2022-4029: The Simple:Press plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the 'sforum_[md5 hash of the WordPress URL]' cookie value in versions up to, and including, 6.8 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link. This would be highly complex to exploit as it would require the attacker to set the cookie a cookie for the targeted user.\n\n- CVE-2022-24720: image_processing is an image processing wrapper for libvips and ImageMagick/GraphicsMagick. Prior to version 1.12.2, using the `#apply` method from image_processing to apply a series of operations that are coming from unsanitized user input allows the attacker to execute shell commands. This method is called internally by Active Storage variants, so Active Storage is vulnerable as well. The vulnerability has been fixed in version 1.12.2 of image_processing. As a workaround, users who process based on user input should always sanitize the user input by allowing only a constrained set of operations.\n\n- CVE-2021-25296: Nagios XI version xi-5.7.5 is affected by OS command injection. The vulnerability exists in the file /usr/local/nagiosxi/html/includes/configwizards/windowswmi/windowswmi.inc.php due to improper sanitization of authenticated user-controlled input by a single HTTP request, which can lead to OS command injection on the Nagios XI server.\n\n- CVE-2021-25297: Nagios XI version xi-5.7.5 is affected by OS command injection.

The device sends unnecessary information to the cloud controller server. Although this information is sent encrypted and has low risk in isolation, it decreases the privacy of the end user. The information sent includes the local IP address being used and the SSID of the Wi-Fi network the device is connected to. (Various resources such as wigle.net can be use for mapping of SSIDs to physical locations.)\n\n- CVE-2021-24170: The REST API endpoint get_users in the User Profile Picture WordPress plugin before 2.5.0 returned more information than was required for its functionality to users with the upload_files capability. This included password hashes, hashed user activation keys, usernames, emails, and other less sensitive information.\n\n- CVE-2021-24585: The Timetable and Event Schedule WordPress plugin before 2.4.0 outputs the Hashed Password, Username and Email Address (along other less sensitive data) of the user related to the Even Head of the Timeslot in the response when requesting the event Timeslot data with a user with the edit_posts capability. Combined with the other Unauthorised Event Timeslot Modification issue (https://wpscan.com/reports/submissions/4699/) where an arbitrary user ID can be set, this could allow low privilege users with the edit_posts capability (such as author) to retrieve sensitive User data by iterating over the user_id\n\n- CVE-2021-26566: Insertion of sensitive information into sent data vulnerability in synorelayd in Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM) before 6.2.3-25426-3 allows man-in-the-middle attackers to execute arbitrary commands via inbound QuickConnect traffic.\n\n- CVE-2021-22172: Improper authorization in GitLab 12.8+ allows a guest user in a private project to view tag data that should be inaccessible on the releases page\n\n- CVE-2021-26923: An issue was discovered in Argo CD before 1.8.4.

A compromised pod with sufficient privilege is able to reconfigure the node\u2019s IPv6 interface due to the node accepting route advertisement by default, allowing the attacker to redirect full or partial network traffic from the node to the compromised pod.\n\n- CVE-2020-14371: A credential leak vulnerability was found in Red Hat Satellite. This flaw exposes the compute resources credentials through VMs that are running on these resources in Satellite.\n\n- CVE-2021-20228: A flaw was found in the Ansible Engine 2.9.18, where sensitive info is not masked by default and is not protected by the no_log feature when using the sub-option feature of the basic.py module. This flaw allows an attacker to obtain sensitive information. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality.\n\n- CVE-2021-20331:  Specific versions of the MongoDB C# Driver may erroneously publish events containing authentication-related data to a command listener configured by an application. The published events may contain security-sensitive data when commands such as \"saslStart\", \"saslContinue\", \"isMaster\", \"createUser\", and \"updateUser\" are executed. Without due care, an application may inadvertently expose this authenticated-related information, e.g., by writing it to a log file. This issue only arises if an application enables the command listener feature (this is not enabled by default). This issue affects the MongoDB C# Driver v2.12 versions prior to and including 2.12.1. \n\n- CVE-2021-26593: In Directus 8.x through 8.8.1, an attacker can see all users in the CMS using the API /users/{id}. For each call, they get in response a lot of information about the user (such as email address, first name, and last name) but also the secret for 2FA if one exists. This secret can be regenerated. NOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer\n\n- CVE-2021-28133: Zoom through 5.5.4 sometimes allows attackers to read private information on a participant's screen, even though the participant never attempted to share the private part of their screen. When a user shares a specific application window via the Share Screen functionality, other meeting participants can briefly see contents of other application windows that were explicitly not shared. The contents of these other windows can (for instance) be seen for a short period of time when they overlay the shared window and get into focus. (An attacker can, of course, use a separate screen-recorder application, unsupported by Zoom, to save all such contents for later replays and analysis.) Depending on the unintentionally shared data, this short exposure of screen contents may be a more or less severe security issue.\n\n- CVE-2021-29483: ManageWiki is an extension to the MediaWiki project. The 'wikiconfig' API leaked the value of private configuration variables set through the ManageWiki variable to all users. This has been patched by https://github.com/miraheze/ManageWiki/compare/99f3b2c8af18...befb83c66f5b.patch. If you are unable to patch set `$wgAPIListModules['wikiconfig'] = 'ApiQueryDisabled';` or remove private config as a workaround.\n\n- CVE-2021-31545: An issue was discovered in the AbuseFilter extension for MediaWiki through 1.35.2.

The Special:AbuseFilter/examine form allowed for the disclosure of suppressed MediaWiki usernames to unprivileged users.\n\n- CVE-2021-32747: Icinga Web 2 is an open source monitoring web interface, framework, and command-line interface. A vulnerability in which custom variables are exposed to unauthorized users exists between versions 2.0.0 and 2.8.2. Custom variables are user-defined keys and values on configuration objects in Icinga 2. These are commonly used to reference secrets in other configurations such as check commands to be able to authenticate with a service being checked. Icinga Web 2 displays these custom variables to logged in users with access to said hosts or services. In order to protect the secrets from being visible to anyone, it's possible to setup protection rules and blacklists in a user's role. Protection rules result in `***` being shown instead of the original value, the key will remain. Backlists will hide a custom variable entirely from the user. Besides using the UI, custom variables can also be accessed differently by using an undocumented URL parameter. By adding a parameter to the affected routes, Icinga Web 2 will show these columns additionally in the respective list. This parameter is also respected when exporting to JSON or CSV. Protection rules and blacklists however have no effect in this case. Custom variables are shown as-is in the result. The issue has been fixed in the 2.9.0, 2.8.3, and 2.7.5 releases. As a workaround, one may set up a restriction to hide hosts and services with the custom variable in question.\n\n- CVE-2020-27831: A flaw was found in Red Hat Quay, where it does not properly protect the authorization token when authorizing email addresses for repository email notifications. This flaw allows an attacker to add email addresses they do not own to repository notifications.\n\n- CVE-2021-21396: wire-server is an open-source back end for Wire, a secure collaboration platform. In wire-server from version 2021-02-16 and before version 2021-03-02, the client metadata of all users was exposed in the `GET /users/list-clients` endpoint. The endpoint could be used by any logged in user who could request client details of any other user (no connection required) as far as they can find their User ID. The exposed metadata included id, class, type, location, time, and cookie. A user on a Wire backend could use this endpoint to find registration time and location for each device for a given list of users. As a workaround, remove `/list-clients` from nginx config. This has been fixed in version 2021-03-02.\n\n- CVE-2021-21400: wire-webapp is an open-source front end for Wire, a secure collaboration platform. In wire-webapp before version 2021-03-15-production.0, when being prompted to enter the app-lock passphrase, the typed passphrase will be sent into the most recently used chat when the user does not actively give focus to the input field. Input element focus is enforced programatically in version 2021-03-15-production.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-21621: Jenkins Support Core Plugin 2.72 and earlier provides the serialized user authentication as part of the \"About user (basic authentication details only)\" information, which can include the session ID of the user creating the support bundle in some configurations.\n\n- CVE-2021-21733: The management system of ZXCDN is impacted by the information leak vulnerability.

Prior to version 4.10.4, for regular (non-LiveQuery) queries, the session token is removed from the response, but for LiveQuery payloads it is currently not. If a user has a LiveQuery subscription on the `Parse.User` class, all session tokens created during user sign-ups will be broadcast as part of the LiveQuery payload. A patch in version 4.10.4 removes session tokens from the LiveQuery payload. As a workaround, set `user.acl(new Parse.ACL())` in a beforeSave trigger to make the user private already on sign-up.\n\n- CVE-2021-41125: Scrapy is a high-level web crawling and scraping framework for Python. If you use `HttpAuthMiddleware` (i.e. the `http_user` and `http_pass` spider attributes) for HTTP authentication, all requests will expose your credentials to the request target. This includes requests generated by Scrapy components, such as `robots.txt` requests sent by Scrapy when the `ROBOTSTXT_OBEY` setting is set to `True`, or as requests reached through redirects. Upgrade to Scrapy 2.5.1 and use the new `http_auth_domain` spider attribute to control which domains are allowed to receive the configured HTTP authentication credentials. If you are using Scrapy 1.8 or a lower version, and upgrading to Scrapy 2.5.1 is not an option, you may upgrade to Scrapy 1.8.1 instead. If you cannot upgrade, set your HTTP authentication credentials on a per-request basis, using for example the `w3lib.http.basic_auth_header` function to convert your credentials into a value that you can assign to the `Authorization` header of your request, instead of defining your credentials globally using `HttpAuthMiddleware`.\n\n- CVE-2021-42089: An issue was discovered in Zammad before 4.1.1. The REST API discloses sensitive information.\n\n- CVE-2021-0602: In onCreateOptionsMenu of WifiNetworkDetailsFragment.java, there is a possible way for guest users to view and modify Wi-Fi settings for all configured APs due to a permissions bypass.

When the scs-library-client is used to pull a container image, with authentication, the HTTP Authorization header sent by the client to the library service may be incorrectly leaked to an S3 backing storage provider. This occurs in a specific flow, where the library service redirects the client to a backing S3 storage server, to perform a multi-part concurrent download. Depending on site configuration, the S3 service may be provided by a third party. An attacker with access to the S3 service may be able to extract user credentials, allowing them to impersonate the user. The vulnerable multi-part concurrent download flow, with redirect to S3, is only used when communicating with a Singularity Enterprise 1.x installation, or third party server implementing this flow. Interaction with Singularity Enterprise 2.x, and Singularity Container Services (cloud.sylabs.io), does not trigger the vulnerable flow. We encourage all users to update. Users who interact with a Singularity Enterprise 1.x installation, using a 3rd party S3 storage service, are advised to revoke and recreate their authentication tokens within Singularity Enterprise. There is no workaround available at this time.\n\n- CVE-2022-31130: Grafana is an open source observability and data visualization platform. Versions of Grafana for endpoints prior to 9.1.8 and 8.5.14 could leak authentication tokens to some destination plugins under some conditions. The vulnerability impacts data source and plugin proxy endpoints with authentication tokens. The destination plugin could receive a user's Grafana authentication token. Versions 9.1.8 and 8.5.14 contain a patch for this issue. As a workaround, do not use API keys, JWT authentication, or any HTTP Header based authentication.\n\n- CVE-2022-42132: The Test LDAP Users functionality in Liferay Portal 7.0.0 through 7.4.3.4, and Liferay DXP 7.0 fix pack 102 and earlier, 7.1 before fix pack 27, 7.2 before fix pack 17, 7.3 before update 4, and DXP 7.4 GA includes the LDAP credential in the page URL when paginating through the list of users, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers or attackers with access to the request logs to see the LDAP credential.\n\n- CVE-2022-31746: Internal URLs are protected by a secret UUID key, which could have been leaked to web page through the Referrer header. This vulnerability affects Firefox for iOS < 102.\n\n- CVE-2021-23937: A DNS proxy and possible amplification attack vulnerability in WebClientInfo of Apache Wicket allows an attacker to trigger arbitrary DNS lookups from the server when the X-Forwarded-For header is not properly sanitized. This DNS lookup can be engineered to overload an internal DNS server or to slow down request processing of the Apache Wicket application causing a possible denial of service on either the internal infrastructure or the web application itself. This issue affects Apache Wicket Apache Wicket 9.x version 9.2.0 and prior versions; Apache Wicket 8.x version 8.11.0 and prior versions; Apache Wicket 7.x version 7.17.0 and prior versions and Apache Wicket 6.x version 6.2.0 and later versions.\n\n- CVE-2022-0474: Full list of recipients from customer users in a contact field could be disclosed in notification emails event when the notification is set to be sent to each recipient individually.

There are currently no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-31069: NestJS Proxy is a NestJS module to decorate and proxy calls. Prior to version 0.7.0, the nestjs-proxy library did not have a way to control when Authorization headers should should be forwarded for specific backend services configured by the application developer. This could have resulted in sensitive information such as OAuth bearer access tokens being inadvertently exposed to such services that should not see them. A new feature has been introduced in the patched version of nestjs-proxy that allows application developers to opt out of forwarding the Authorization headers on a per service basis using the `forwardToken` config setting. Developers are advised to review the README for this library on Github or NPM for further details on how this configuration can be applied. This issue has been fixed in version 0.7.0 of `@finastra/nestjs-proxy`. Users of `@ffdc/nestjs-proxy` are advised that this package has been deprecated and is no longer being maintained or receiving updates. Such users should update their package.json file to use `@finastra/nestjs-proxy` instead.\n\n- CVE-2022-31070: NestJS Proxy is a NestJS module to decorate and proxy calls. Prior to version 0.7.0, the nestjs-proxy library did not have a way to block sensitive cookies (e.g. session cookies) from being forwarded to backend services configured by the application developer. This could have led to sensitive cookies being inadvertently exposed to such services that should not see them. The patched version now blocks cookies from being forwarded by default. However developers can configure an allow-list of cookie names by using the `allowedCookies` config setting. This issue has been fixed in version 0.7.0 of `@finastra/nestjs-proxy`. Users of `@ffdc/nestjs-proxy` are advised that this package has been deprecated and is no longer being maintained or receiving updates. Such users should update their package.json file to use `@finastra/nestjs-proxy` instead.\n\n- CVE-2022-3348: Just like in the previous report, an attacker could steal the account of different users. But in this case, it's a little bit more specific, because it is needed to be an editor in the same app as the victim.\n\n- CVE-2022-38113: This vulnerability discloses build and services versions in the server response header. \n\n- CVE-2022-46150: Discourse is an open-source discussion platform.

Some CMS (Content Management Systems) also use templates.\n\n\nTemplate engines often have their own custom command or expression language. If an attacker can influence input into a template before it is processed, then the attacker can invoke arbitrary expressions, i.e. perform injection attacks. For example, in some template languages, an attacker could inject the expression \"{{7*7}}\" and determine if the output returns \"49\" instead. The syntax varies depending on the language.\n\n\nIn some cases, XSS-style attacks can work, which can obscure the root cause if the developer does not closely investigate the root cause of the error.\n\n\nTemplate engines can be used on the server or client, so both \"sides\" could be affected by injection. The mechanisms of attack or the affected technologies might be different, but the mistake is fundamentally the same.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2024-34359: Chain: Python bindings for LLM library do not use a sandboxed environment when parsing a template and constructing a prompt, allowing jinja2 Server Side Template Injection and code execution - one variant of a \"prompt injection\" attack.\n\n- CVE-2017-16783: server-side template injection in content management server\n\n- CVE-2020-9437: authentication / identity management product has client-side template injection\n\n- CVE-2020-12790: Server-Side Template Injection using a Twig template\n\n- CVE-2021-21244: devops platform allows SSTI\n\n- CVE-2020-4027: bypass of Server-Side Template Injection protection mechanism with macros in Velocity templates\n\n- CVE-2020-26282: web browser proxy server allows Java EL expressions from Server-Side Template Injection\n\n- CVE-2020-1961: SSTI involving mail templates and JEXL expressions\n\n- CVE-2019-19999: product does not use a \"safe\" setting for a FreeMarker configuration, allowing SSTI\n\n- CVE-2018-20465: product allows read of sensitive database username/password variables using server-side template injection\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-25283: An issue was discovered in through SaltStack Salt before 3002.5.

In versions before 3.0.0 vault-cli features the ability for rendering templated values. When a secret starts with the prefix `!template!`, vault-cli interprets the rest of the contents of the secret as a Jinja2 template. Jinja2 is a powerful templating engine and is not designed to safely render arbitrary templates. An attacker controlling a jinja2 template rendered on a machine can trigger arbitrary code, making this a Remote Code Execution (RCE) risk. If the content of the vault can be completely trusted, then this is not a problem. Otherwise, if your threat model includes cases where an attacker can manipulate a secret value read from the vault using vault-cli, then this vulnerability may impact you. In 3.0.0, the code related to interpreting vault templated secrets has been removed entirely. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. For users unable to upgrade a workaround does exist. Using the environment variable `VAULT_CLI_RENDER=false` or the flag `--no-render` (placed between `vault-cli` and the subcommand, e.g. `vault-cli --no-render get-all`) or adding `render: false` to the vault-cli configuration yaml file disables rendering and removes the vulnerability. Using the python library, you can use: `vault_cli.get_client(render=False)` when creating your client to get a client that will not render templated secrets and thus operates securely.\n\n- CVE-2021-46063: MCMS v5.2.5 was discovered to contain a Server Side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerability via the Template Management module.\n\n- CVE-2021-40219: Bolt CMS <= 4.2 is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution.

This is fairly common when using key-based access to resources in a multi-user context.\n\nDescription:\n\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\nExtended Details:\n\n\n\nRetrieval of a user record occurs in the system based on some key value that is under user control. The key would typically identify a user-related record stored in the system and would be used to lookup that record for presentation to the user. It is likely that an attacker would have to be an authenticated user in the system. However, the authorization process would not properly check the data access operation to ensure that the authenticated user performing the operation has sufficient entitlements to perform the requested data access, hence bypassing any other authorization checks present in the system.\n\n\nFor example, attackers can look at places where user specific data is retrieved (e.g. search screens) and determine whether the key for the item being looked up is controllable externally. The key may be a hidden field in the HTML form field, might be passed as a URL parameter or as an unencrypted cookie variable, then in each of these cases it will be possible to tamper with the key value.\n\n\nOne manifestation of this weakness is when a system uses sequential or otherwise easily-guessable session IDs that would allow one user to easily switch to another user's session and read/modify their data.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-36539: An educational application does not appropriately restrict file IDs to a particular user. The attacker can brute-force guess IDs, indicating IDOR.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-26679: vFairs 3.3 is affected by Insecure Permissions.

Several APIs on the web system display, without authorization, sensitive information such as health statements, previous bills in a specific restaurant, alcohol consumption and smoking habits. Each of the described API\u2019s, has in its URL one or more MongoDB ID which is not so simple to enumerate. However, they each receive a \u2018tiny URL\u2019 in Tabit\u2019s domain, in the form of https://tbit.be/{suffix} with suffix being a 5 characters long string containing numbers, lower- and upper-case letters. It is not so simple to enumerate them all, but really easy to find some that work and lead to a personal endpoint. This is both an example of OWASP: API4 - rate limiting and OWASP: API1 - Broken object level authorization. Furthermore, the redirect URL disclosed the MongoDB IDs discussed above, and we could use them to query other endpoints disclosing more personal information. For example: The URL https://tabitisrael.co.il/online-reservations/health-statement?orgId={org_id}&healthStatementId={health_statement_id} is used to invite friends to fill a health statement before attending the restaurant. We can use the health_statement_id to access the https://tgm-api.tabit.cloud/health-statement/{health_statement_id} API which disclose medical information as well as id number.\n\n- CVE-2022-36202: Doctor's Appointment System1.0 is vulnerable to Incorrect Access Control via edoc/patient/settings.php.

A sync token is used in Seafile file syncing protocol to authorize access to library data. To improve performance, the token is cached in memory in seaf-server. Upon receiving a token from sync client or SeaDrive client, the server checks whether the token exist in the cache. However, if the token exists in cache, the server doesn't check whether it's associated with the specific library in the URL. This vulnerability makes it possible to use any valid sync token to access data from any **known** library. Note that the attacker has to first find out the ID of a library which it has no access to. The library ID is a random UUID, which is not possible to be guessed. There are no workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-1949: An access control bypass vulnerability found in 389-ds-base.

This assumption may be even stronger when the programmer has encoded the command in a way that prevents separate commands from being provided maliciously, e.g. in the case of shell metacharacters. When constructing the command, the developer may use whitespace or other delimiters that are required to separate arguments when the command. However, if an attacker can provide an untrusted input that contains argument-separating delimiters, then the resulting command will have more arguments than intended by the developer. The attacker may then be able to change the behavior of the command. Depending on the functionality supported by the extraneous arguments, this may have security-relevant consequences.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-36069: Python-based dependency management tool avoids OS command injection when generating Git commands but allows injection of optional arguments with input beginning with a dash (CWE-88), potentially allowing for code execution.\n\n- CVE-1999-0113: Canonical Example - \"-froot\" argument is passed on to another program, where the \"-f\" causes execution as user \"root\"\n\n- CVE-2001-0150: Web browser executes Telnet sessions using command line arguments that are specified by the web site, which could allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands.\n\n- CVE-2001-0667: Web browser allows remote attackers to execute commands by spawning Telnet with a log file option on the command line and writing arbitrary code into an executable file which is later executed.\n\n- CVE-2002-0985: Argument injection vulnerability in the mail function for PHP may allow attackers to bypass safe mode restrictions and modify command line arguments to the MTA (e.g. sendmail) possibly executing commands.\n\n- CVE-2003-0907: Help and Support center in windows does not properly validate HCP URLs, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via quotation marks in an \"hcp://\" URL.\n\n- CVE-2004-0121: Mail client does not sufficiently filter parameters of mailto: URLs when using them as arguments to mail executable, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary programs.\n\n- CVE-2004-0473: Web browser doesn't filter \"-\" when invoking various commands, allowing command-line switches to be specified.\n\n- CVE-2004-0480: Mail client allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a URI that uses a UNC network share pathname to provide an alternate configuration file.\n\n- CVE-2004-0489: SSH URI handler for web browser allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or conduct port forwarding via the a command line option.\n\n- CVE-2004-0411: Web browser doesn't filter \"-\" when invoking various commands, allowing command-line switches to be specified.\n\n- CVE-2005-4699: Argument injection vulnerability in TellMe 1.2 and earlier allows remote attackers to modify command line arguments for the Whois program and obtain sensitive information via \"--\" style options in the q_Host parameter.\n\n- CVE-2006-1865: Beagle before 0.2.5 can produce certain insecure command lines to launch external helper applications while indexing, which allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands.

NOTE: it is not clear whether this issue is implementation-specific or a problem in the Microsoft API.\n\n- CVE-2006-2057: Argument injection vulnerability in Mozilla Firefox 1.0.6 allows user-assisted remote attackers to modify command line arguments to an invoked mail client via \" (double quote) characters in a mailto: scheme handler, as demonstrated by launching Microsoft Outlook with an arbitrary filename as an attachment. NOTE: it is not clear whether this issue is implementation-specific or a problem in the Microsoft API.\n\n- CVE-2006-2058: Argument injection vulnerability in Avant Browser 10.1 Build 17 allows user-assisted remote attackers to modify command line arguments to an invoked mail client via \" (double quote) characters in a mailto: scheme handler, as demonstrated by launching Microsoft Outlook with an arbitrary filename as an attachment. NOTE: it is not clear whether this issue is implementation-specific or a problem in the Microsoft API.\n\n- CVE-2006-2312: Argument injection vulnerability in the URI handler in Skype 2.0.*.104 and 2.5.*.0 through 2.5.*.78 for Windows allows remote authorized attackers to download arbitrary files via a URL that contains certain command-line switches.\n\n- CVE-2006-3015: Argument injection vulnerability in WinSCP 3.8.1 build 328 allows remote attackers to upload or download arbitrary files via encoded spaces and double-quote characters in a scp or sftp URI.\n\n- CVE-2006-4692: Argument injection vulnerability in the Windows Object Packager (packager.exe) in Microsoft Windows XP SP1 and SP2 and Server 2003 SP1 and earlier allows remote user-assisted attackers to execute arbitrary commands via a crafted file with a \"/\" (slash) character in the filename of the Command Line property, followed by a valid file extension, which causes the command before the slash to be executed, aka \"Object Packager Dialogue Spoofing Vulnerability.\"\n\n- CVE-2006-6597: Argument injection vulnerability in HyperAccess 8.4 allows user-assisted remote attackers to execute arbitrary vbscript and commands via the /r option in a telnet:// URI, which is configured to use hawin32.exe.\n\n- CVE-2007-0882: Argument injection vulnerability in the telnet daemon (in.telnetd) in Solaris 10 and 11 (SunOS 5.10 and 5.11) misinterprets certain client \"-f\" sequences as valid requests for the login program to skip authentication, which allows remote attackers to log into certain accounts, as demonstrated by the bin account.\n\n- CVE-2001-1246: Language interpreter's mail function accepts another argument that is concatenated to a string used in a dangerous popen() call. Since there is no neutralization of this argument, both OS Command Injection (CWE-78) and Argument Injection (CWE-88) are possible.\n\n- CVE-2019-13475: Argument injection allows execution of arbitrary commands by injecting a \"-exec\" option, which is executed by the command.\n\n- CVE-2016-10033: Argument injection in mail-processing function allows writing unxpected files and executing programs using tecnically-valid email addresses that insert \"-o\" and \"-X\" switches.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-27730: Accellion FTA 9_12_432 and earlier is affected by argument injection via a crafted POST request to an admin endpoint.

NOTE: the discoverer states \"I believe that this vulnerability cannot actually be exploited.\"\n\n- CVE-2021-29461: Discord Recon Server is a bot that allows one to do one's reconnaissance process from one's Discord. A vulnerability in Discord Recon Server prior to 0.0.3 could be exploited to read internal files from the system and write files into the system resulting in remote code execution. This issue has been fixed in version 0.0.3. As a workaround, one may copy the code from `assets/CommandInjection.py` in the Discord Recon Server code repository and overwrite vulnerable code from one's own Discord Recon Server implementation with code that contains the patch.\n\n- CVE-2021-29472: Composer is a dependency manager for PHP. URLs for Mercurial repositories in the root composer.json and package source download URLs are not sanitized correctly. Specifically crafted URL values allow code to be executed in the HgDriver if hg/Mercurial is installed on the system. The impact to Composer users directly is limited as the composer.json file is typically under their own control and source download URLs can only be supplied by third party Composer repositories they explicitly trust to download and execute source code from, e.g. Composer plugins. The main impact is to services passing user input to Composer, including Packagist.org and Private Packagist. This allowed users to trigger remote code execution. The vulnerability has been patched on Packagist.org and Private Packagist within 12h of receiving the initial vulnerability report and based on a review of logs, to the best of our knowledge, was not abused by anyone. Other services/tools using VcsRepository/VcsDriver or derivatives may also be vulnerable and should upgrade their composer/composer dependency immediately. Versions 1.10.22 and 2.0.13 include patches for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2021-37040: There is a Parameter injection vulnerability in Huawei Smartphone.Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may cause privilege escalation of files after CIFS share mounting.\n\n- CVE-2021-43286: An issue was discovered in ThoughtWorks GoCD before 21.3.0. An attacker with privileges to create a new pipeline on a GoCD server can abuse a command-line injection in the Git URL \"Test Connection\" feature to execute arbitrary code.\n\n- CVE-2021-43809: `Bundler` is a package for managing application dependencies in Ruby. In `bundler` versions before 2.2.33, when working with untrusted and apparently harmless `Gemfile`'s, it is not expected that they lead to execution of external code, unless that's explicit in the ruby code inside the `Gemfile` itself. However, if the `Gemfile` includes `gem` entries that use the `git` option with invalid, but seemingly harmless, values with a leading dash, this can be false. To handle dependencies that come from a Git repository instead of a registry, Bundler uses various commands, such as `git clone`. These commands are being constructed using user input (e.g. the repository URL). When building the commands, Bundler versions before 2.2.33 correctly avoid Command Injection vulnerabilities by passing an array of arguments instead of a command string. However, there is the possibility that a user input starts with a dash (`-`) and is therefore treated as an optional argument instead of a positional one. This can lead to Code Execution because some of the commands have options that can be leveraged to run arbitrary executables. Since this value comes from the `Gemfile` file, it can contain any character, including a leading dash. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker has to craft a directory containing a `Gemfile` file that declares a dependency that is located in a Git repository. This dependency has to have a Git URL in the form of `-u./payload`. This URL will be used to construct a Git clone command but will be interpreted as the upload-pack argument. Then this directory needs to be shared with the victim, who then needs to run a command that evaluates the Gemfile, such as `bundle lock`, inside. This vulnerability can lead to Arbitrary Code Execution, which could potentially lead to the takeover of the system. However, the exploitability is very low, because it requires a lot of user interaction. Bundler 2.2.33 has patched this problem by inserting `--` as an argument before any positional arguments to those Git commands that were affected by this issue. Regardless of whether users can upgrade or not, they should review any untrustred `Gemfile`'s before running any `bundler` commands that may read them, since they can contain arbitrary ruby code.\n\n- CVE-2022-21187: The package libvcs before 0.11.1 are vulnerable to Command Injection via argument injection. When calling the update_repo function (when using hg), the url parameter is passed to the hg clone command. By injecting some hg options it was possible to get arbitrary command execution.\n\n- CVE-2022-21223: The package cocoapods-downloader before 1.6.2 are vulnerable to Command Injection via hg argument injection. When calling the download function (when using hg), the url (and/or revision, tag, branch) is passed to the hg clone command in a way that additional flags can be set. The additional flags can be used to perform a command injection.\n\n- CVE-2022-21235: The package github.com/masterminds/vcs before 1.13.3 are vulnerable to Command Injection via argument injection. When hg is executed, argument strings are passed to hg in a way that additional flags can be set. The additional flags can be used to perform a command injection.\n\n- CVE-2022-24433: The package simple-git before 3.3.0 are vulnerable to Command Injection via argument injection. When calling the .fetch(remote, branch, handlerFn) function, both the remote and branch parameters are passed to the git fetch subcommand. By injecting some git options it was possible to get arbitrary command execution.\n\n- CVE-2022-24440: The package cocoapods-downloader before 1.6.0, from 1.6.2 and before 1.6.3 are vulnerable to Command Injection via git argument injection. When calling the Pod::Downloader.preprocess_options function and using git, both the git and branch parameters are passed to the git ls-remote subcommand in a way that additional flags can be set. The additional flags can be used to perform a command injection.\n\n- CVE-2022-25648: The package git before 1.11.0 are vulnerable to Command Injection via git argument injection. When calling the fetch(remote = 'origin', opts = {}) function, the remote parameter is passed to the git fetch subcommand in a way that additional flags can be set. The additional flags can be used to perform a command injection.\n\n- CVE-2022-25766: The package ungit before 1.5.20 are vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) via argument injection. The issue occurs when calling the /api/fetch endpoint. User controlled values (remote and ref) are passed to the git fetch command. By injecting some git options it was possible to get arbitrary command execution.\n\n- CVE-2022-25865: The package workspace-tools before 0.18.4 are vulnerable to Command Injection via git argument injection. When calling the fetchRemoteBranch(remote: string, remoteBranch: string, cwd: string) function, both the remote and remoteBranch parameters are passed to the git fetch subcommand in a way that additional flags can be set. The additional flags can be used to perform a command injection.\n\n- CVE-2022-25866: The package czproject/git-php before 4.0.3 are vulnerable to Command Injection via git argument injection. When calling the isRemoteUrlReadable($url, array $refs = NULL) function, both the url and refs parameters are passed to the git ls-remote subcommand in a way that additional flags can be set. The additional flags can be used to perform a command injection.\n\n- CVE-2022-25900: All versions of package git-clone are vulnerable to Command Injection due to insecure usage of the --upload-pack feature of git.\n\n- CVE-2022-26532: A argument injection vulnerability in the 'packet-trace' CLI command of Zyxel USG/ZyWALL series firmware versions 4.09 through 4.71, USG FLEX series firmware versions 4.50 through 5.21, ATP series firmware versions 4.32 through 5.21, VPN series firmware versions 4.30 through 5.21, NSG series firmware versions 1.00 through 1.33 Patch 4, NXC2500 firmware version 6.10(AAIG.3) and earlier versions, NAP203 firmware version 6.25(ABFA.7) and earlier versions, NWA50AX firmware version 6.25(ABYW.5) and earlier versions, WAC500 firmware version 6.30(ABVS.2) and earlier versions, and WAX510D firmware version 6.30(ABTF.2) and earlier versions, that could allow a local authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary OS commands by including crafted arguments to the CLI command.\n\n- CVE-2022-36069: Poetry is a dependency manager for Python. When handling dependencies that come from a Git repository instead of a registry, Poetry uses various commands, such as `git clone`. These commands are constructed using user input (e.g. the repository URL). When building the commands, Poetry correctly avoids Command Injection vulnerabilities by passing an array of arguments instead of a command string. However, there is the possibility that a user input starts with a dash (`-`) and is therefore treated as an optional argument instead of a positional one. This can lead to Code Execution because some of the commands have options that can be leveraged to run arbitrary executables. If a developer is exploited, the attacker could steal credentials or persist their access. If the exploit happens on a server, the attackers could use their access to attack other internal systems. Since this vulnerability requires a fair amount of user interaction, it is not as dangerous as a remotely exploitable one. However, it still puts developers at risk when dealing with untrusted files in a way they think is safe, because the exploit still works when the victim tries to make sure nothing can happen, e.g. by vetting any Git or Poetry config files that might be present in the directory. Versions 1.1.9 and 1.2.0b1 contain patches for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-37027: Ahsay AhsayCBS 9.1.4.0 allows an authenticated system user to inject arbitrary Java JVM options. Administrators that can modify the Runtime Options in the web interface can inject Java Runtime Options. These take effect after a restart. For example, an attacker can enable JMX services and consequently achieve remote code execution as the system user.\n\n- CVE-2022-23221: H2 Console before 2.1.210 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a jdbc:h2:mem JDBC URL containing the IGNORE_UNKNOWN_SETTINGS=TRUE;FORBID_CREATION=FALSE;INIT=RUNSCRIPT substring, a different vulnerability than CVE-2021-42392.\n\n- CVE-2022-24066: The package simple-git before 3.5.0 are vulnerable to Command Injection due to an incomplete fix of [CVE-2022-24433](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-SIMPLEGIT-2421199) which only patches against the git fetch attack vector. A similar use of the --upload-pack feature of git is also supported for git clone, which the prior fix didn't cover.\n\n- CVE-2022-24376: All versions of package git-promise are vulnerable to Command Injection due to an inappropriate fix of a prior [vulnerability](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-GITPROMISE-567476) in this package. **Note:** Please note that the vulnerability will not be fixed. The README file was updated with a warning regarding this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-24437: The package git-pull-or-clone before 2.0.2 are vulnerable to Command Injection due to the use of the --upload-pack feature of git which is also supported for git clone. The source includes the use of the secure child process API spawn(). However, the outpath parameter passed to it may be a command-line argument to the git clone command and result in arbitrary command injection.\n\n- CVE-2021-46850: myVesta Control Panel before 0.9.8-26-43 and Vesta Control Panel before 0.9.8-26 are vulnerable to command injection. An authenticated and remote administrative user can execute arbitrary commands via the v_sftp_license parameter when sending HTTP POST requests to the /edit/server endpoint.\n\n- CVE-2022-24953: The Crypt_GPG extension before 1.6.7 for PHP does not prevent additional options in GPG calls, which presents a risk for certain environments and GPG versions.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-77 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-74 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-77 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-77 (ChildOf)",

            "extended_description": "\n\nCross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:\n\n\n  1. Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.\n\n  1. The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.\n\n  1. During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.\n\n  1. A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.\n\n  1. Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.\n\n  1. This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.\n\nThere are three main kinds of XSS:\n\n  -  **Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent)**  - The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.\n\n  -  **Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent)**  - The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs. \n\n  -  **Type 0: DOM-Based XSS**  - In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible. \n\nOnce the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"\n\nIn many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.\n",

However, including unexpected data in an HTTP header allows an attacker to specify the entirety of the HTTP message that is rendered by the client HTTP agent (e.g., web browser) or back-end HTTP agent (e.g., web server), whether the message is part of a request or a response. \n\n\nWhen an HTTP request contains unexpected CR and LF characters, the server may respond with an output stream that is interpreted as \"splitting\" the stream into two different HTTP messages instead of one. CR is carriage return, also given by %0d or \\r, and LF is line feed, also given by %0a or \\n.\n\n\nIn addition to CR and LF characters, other valid/RFC compliant special characters and unique character encodings can be utilized, such as HT (horizontal tab, also given by %09 or \\t) and SP (space, also given as + sign or %20).\n\n\nThese types of unvalidated and unexpected data in HTTP message headers allow an attacker to control the second \"split\" message to mount attacks such as server-side request forgery, cross-site scripting, and cache poisoning attacks.\n\n\nHTTP response splitting weaknesses may be present when:\n\n\n  1. Data enters a web application through an untrusted source, most frequently an HTTP request.\n\n  1. The data is included in an HTTP response header sent to a web user without neutralizing malicious characters that can be interpreted as separator characters for headers.\n\n",

Web applications often mistakenly make the assumption that data passed to the client in hidden fields or cookies is not susceptible to tampering. Improper validation of data that are user-controllable can lead to the application processing incorrect, and often malicious, input.\n\n\nFor example, custom cookies commonly store session data or persistent data across sessions. This kind of session data is normally involved in security related decisions on the server side, such as user authentication and access control. Thus, the cookies might contain sensitive data such as user credentials and privileges. This is a dangerous practice, as it can often lead to improper reliance on the value of the client-provided cookie by the server side application.\n",

              "extended_description": "\n\nCross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:\n\n\n  1. Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.\n\n  1. The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.\n\n  1. During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.\n\n  1. A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.\n\n  1. Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.\n\n  1. This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.\n\nThere are three main kinds of XSS:\n\n  -  **Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent)**  - The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.\n\n  -  **Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent)**  - The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs. \n\n  -  **Type 0: DOM-Based XSS**  - In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible. \n\nOnce the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"\n\nIn many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.\n",

However, including unexpected data in an HTTP header allows an attacker to specify the entirety of the HTTP message that is rendered by the client HTTP agent (e.g., web browser) or back-end HTTP agent (e.g., web server), whether the message is part of a request or a response. \n\n\nWhen an HTTP request contains unexpected CR and LF characters, the server may respond with an output stream that is interpreted as \"splitting\" the stream into two different HTTP messages instead of one. CR is carriage return, also given by %0d or \\r, and LF is line feed, also given by %0a or \\n.\n\n\nIn addition to CR and LF characters, other valid/RFC compliant special characters and unique character encodings can be utilized, such as HT (horizontal tab, also given by %09 or \\t) and SP (space, also given as + sign or %20).\n\n\nThese types of unvalidated and unexpected data in HTTP message headers allow an attacker to control the second \"split\" message to mount attacks such as server-side request forgery, cross-site scripting, and cache poisoning attacks.\n\n\nHTTP response splitting weaknesses may be present when:\n\n\n  1. Data enters a web application through an untrusted source, most frequently an HTTP request.\n\n  1. The data is included in an HTTP response header sent to a web user without neutralizing malicious characters that can be interpreted as separator characters for headers.\n\n",

Web applications often mistakenly make the assumption that data passed to the client in hidden fields or cookies is not susceptible to tampering. Improper validation of data that are user-controllable can lead to the application processing incorrect, and often malicious, input.\n\n\nFor example, custom cookies commonly store session data or persistent data across sessions. This kind of session data is normally involved in security related decisions on the server side, such as user authentication and access control. Thus, the cookies might contain sensitive data such as user credentials and privileges. This is a dangerous practice, as it can often lead to improper reliance on the value of the client-provided cookie by the server side application.\n",

The attacker could then use a modified client to replay the stolen hash without having knowledge of the original password.\n\n\nAs a result, the server-side comparison against a client-side hash does not provide any more security than the use of passwords without hashing.\n",

However, including unexpected data in an HTTP header allows an attacker to specify the entirety of the HTTP message that is rendered by the client HTTP agent (e.g., web browser) or back-end HTTP agent (e.g., web server), whether the message is part of a request or a response. \n\n\nWhen an HTTP request contains unexpected CR and LF characters, the server may respond with an output stream that is interpreted as \"splitting\" the stream into two different HTTP messages instead of one. CR is carriage return, also given by %0d or \\r, and LF is line feed, also given by %0a or \\n.\n\n\nIn addition to CR and LF characters, other valid/RFC compliant special characters and unique character encodings can be utilized, such as HT (horizontal tab, also given by %09 or \\t) and SP (space, also given as + sign or %20).\n\n\nThese types of unvalidated and unexpected data in HTTP message headers allow an attacker to control the second \"split\" message to mount attacks such as server-side request forgery, cross-site scripting, and cache poisoning attacks.\n\n\nHTTP response splitting weaknesses may be present when:\n\n\n  1. Data enters a web application through an untrusted source, most frequently an HTTP request.\n\n  1. The data is included in an HTTP response header sent to a web user without neutralizing malicious characters that can be interpreted as separator characters for headers.\n\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-15811: Chain: Proxy uses a substring search instead of parsing the Transfer-Encoding header (CWE-697), allowing request splitting (CWE-113) and cache poisoning\n\n- CVE-2021-41084: Scala-based HTTP interface allows request splitting and response splitting through header names, header values, status reasons, and URIs\n\n- CVE-2018-12116: Javascript-based framework allows request splitting through a path option of an HTTP request\n\n- CVE-2004-2146: Application accepts CRLF in an object ID, allowing HTTP response splitting.\n\n- CVE-2004-1656: Shopping cart allows HTTP response splitting to perform HTML injection via CRLF in a parameter for a url\n\n- CVE-2005-2060: Bulletin board allows response splitting via CRLF in parameter.\n\n- CVE-2004-2512: Response splitting via CRLF in PHPSESSID.\n\n- CVE-2005-1951: e-commerce app allows HTTP response splitting using CRLF in object id parameters\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-0268: An Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Response Splitting') weakness in J-web of Juniper Networks Junos OS leads to buffer overflows, segment faults, or other impacts, which allows an attacker to modify the integrity of the device and exfiltration information from the device without authentication. The weakness can be exploited to facilitate cross-site scripting (XSS), cookie manipulation (modifying session cookies, stealing cookies) and more. This weakness can also be exploited by directing a user to a seemingly legitimate link from the affected site. The attacker requires no special access or permissions to the device to carry out such attacks. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS: 18.1 versions prior to 18.1R3-S11; 18.2 versions prior to 18.2R3-S5; 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R2-S4, 18.3R3-S3; 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R2-S5, 18.4R3-S3; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R2-S2, 19.1R3-S2; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S5, 19.2R2; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R3; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R1-S3, 19.4R2, 19.4R3; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R1-S2, 20.1R2. This issue does not affect Juniper Networks Junos OS versions prior to 18.1R1.\n\n- CVE-2021-28979: SafeNet KeySecure Management Console 8.12.0 is vulnerable to HTTP response splitting attacks. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using specially-crafted URL to cause the server to return a split response, once the URL is clicked.\n\n- CVE-2021-41084: http4s is an open source scala interface for HTTP. In affected versions http4s is vulnerable to response-splitting or request-splitting attacks when untrusted user input is used to create any of the following fields: Header names (`Header.name`\u00e5), Header values (`Header.value`), Status reason phrases (`Status.reason`), URI paths (`Uri.Path`), URI authority registered names (`URI.RegName`) (through 0.21). This issue has been resolved in versions 0.21.30, 0.22.5, 0.23.4, and 1.0.0-M27 perform the following. As a matter of practice http4s services and client applications should sanitize any user input in the aforementioned fields before returning a request or response to the backend. The carriage return, newline, and null characters are the most threatening.\n\n- CVE-2021-45818: SAFARI Montage 8.7.32 is affected by a CRLF injection vulnerability which can lead to HTTP response splitting.\n\n- CVE-2021-33621: The cgi gem before 0.1.0.2, 0.2.x before 0.2.2, and 0.3.x before 0.3.5 for Ruby allows HTTP response splitting. This is relevant to applications that use untrusted user input either to generate an HTTP response or to create a CGI::Cookie object.\n\n- CVE-2021-40336: A vulnerability exists in the http web interface where the web interface does not validate data in an HTTP header. This causes a possible HTTP response splitting, which if exploited could lead an attacker to channel down harmful code into the user\u2019s web browser, such as to steal the session cookies. Thus, an attacker who successfully makes an MSM user who has already established a session to MSM web interface clicks a forged link to the MSM web interface, e.g., the link is sent per E-Mail, could trick the user into downloading malicious software onto his computer. This issue affects: Hitachi Energy MSM V2.2 and prior versions.\n\n- CVE-2021-41437: An HTTP response splitting attack in web application in ASUS RT-AX88U before v3.0.0.4.388.20558 allows an attacker to craft a specific URL that if an authenticated victim visits it, the URL will give access to the cloud storage of the attacker.\n\n- CVE-2022-20772: A vulnerability in Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA) and Cisco Secure Email and Web Manager could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct an HTTP response splitting attack. This vulnerability is due to the failure of the application or its environment to properly sanitize input values. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious HTTP headers, controlling the response body, or splitting the response into multiple responses.\n\n- CVE-2022-35507: A response-header CRLF injection vulnerability in the Proxmox Virtual Environment (PVE) and Proxmox Mail Gateway (PMG) web interface allows a remote attacker to set cookies for a victim's browser that are longer than the server expects, causing a client-side DoS. This affects Chromium-based browsers because they allow injection of response headers with %0d. This is fixed in pve-http-server 4.1-3.\n\n- CVE-2022-37240: MDaemon Technologies SecurityGateway for Email Servers 8.5.2 is vulnerable to HTTP Response splitting via the format parameter.\n\n- CVE-2022-37242: MDaemon Technologies SecurityGateway for Email Servers 8.5.2, is vulnerable to HTTP Response splitting via the data parameter.\n\n- CVE-2022-37953: An HTTP response splitting vulnerability exists in the AM Gateway Challenge-Response dialog of WorkstationST (<v07.09.15) and could allow an attacker to compromise a victim's browser/session. WorkstationST is only deployed in specific, controlled environments rendering attack complexity significantly higher than if the attack were conducted on the software in isolation. WorkstationST v07.09.15 can be found in ControlST v07.09.07 SP8 and greater.\n\n- CVE-2022-42471: An improper neutralization of CRLF sequences in HTTP headers ('HTTP Response Splitting') vulnerability [CWE-113] In FortiWeb version 7.0.0 through 7.0.2, FortiWeb version 6.4.0 through 6.4.2, FortiWeb version 6.3.6 through 6.3.20 may allow an authenticated and remote attacker to inject arbitrary headers.\n\n- CVE-2022-42472: A improper neutralization of crlf sequences in http headers ('http response splitting') in Fortinet FortiOS versions 7.2.0 through 7.2.2, 7.0.0 through 7.0.8, 6.4.0 through 6.4.11, 6.2.0 through 6.2.12, 6.0.0 through 6.0.16, FortiProxy 7.2.0 through 7.2.1, 7.0.0 through 7.0.7, 2.0.0 through 2.0.10, 1.2.0 through 1.2.13, 1.1.0 through 1.1.6 may allow an authenticated and remote attacker to perform an HTTP request splitting attack which gives attackers control of the remaining headers and body of the response.\n\n- CVE-2022-47052: The web interface of the 'Nighthawk R6220 AC1200 Smart Wi-Fi Router' is vulnerable to a CRLF Injection attack that can be leveraged to perform Reflected XSS and HTML Injection. A malicious unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability using a specially crafted URL. This affects firmware versions: V1.1.0.112_1.0.1, V1.1.0.114_1.0.1.\n\n- CVE-2021-37499: CRLF vulnerability in Reprise License Manager (RLM) web interface through 14.2BL4 in the password parameter in View License Result function, that allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary HTTP headers.\n\n- CVE-2022-32453: HTTP header injection vulnerability in Cybozu Office 10.0.0 to 10.8.5 may allow a remote attacker to obtain and/or alter the data of the product via unspecified vectors.\n\n- CVE-2022-3918: A program using FoundationNetworking in swift-corelibs-foundation is potentially vulnerable to CRLF ( ) injection in URLRequest headers. In this vulnerability, a client can insert one or several CRLF sequences into a URLRequest header value. When that request is sent via URLSession to an HTTP server, the server may interpret the content after the CRLF as extra headers, or even a second request. For example, consider a URLRequest to http://example.com/ with the GET method. Suppose we set the URLRequest header \"Foo\" to the value \"Bar Extra-Header: Added GET /other HTTP/1.1\". When this request is sent, it will appear to the server as two requests: GET / HTTP/1.1 Foo: Bar Extra-Header: Added GET /other HTTP/1.1 In this manner, the client is able to inject extra headers and craft an entirely new request to a separate path, despite only making one API call in URLSession. If a developer has total control over the request and its headers, this vulnerability may not pose a threat. However, this vulnerability escalates if un-sanitized user input is placed in header values. If so, a malicious user could inject new headers or requests to an intermediary or backend server. Developers should be especially careful to sanitize user input in this case, or upgrade their version of swift-corelibs-foundation to include the patch below.\n\n- CVE-2022-4188: Insufficient validation of untrusted input in CORS in Google Chrome on Android prior to 108.0.5359.71 allowed a remote attacker to bypass same origin policy via a crafted HTML page.

It is the lack of verification of these assumptions for user-controlled input that leads to injection problems. Injection problems encompass a wide variety of issues -- all mitigated in very different ways and usually attempted in order to alter the control flow of the process. For this reason, the most effective way to discuss these weaknesses is to note the distinct features that classify them as injection weaknesses. The most important issue to note is that all injection problems share one thing in common -- i.e., they allow for the injection of control plane data into the user-controlled data plane. This means that the execution of the process may be altered by sending code in through legitimate data channels, using no other mechanism. While buffer overflows, and many other flaws, involve the use of some further issue to gain execution, injection problems need only for the data to be parsed.\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2024-5184: API service using a large generative AI model allows direct prompt injection to leak hard-coded system prompts or execute other prompts.\n\n- CVE-2022-36069: Python-based dependency management tool avoids OS command injection when generating Git commands but allows injection of optional arguments with input beginning with a dash (CWE-88), potentially allowing for code execution.\n\n- CVE-1999-0067: Canonical example of OS command injection.

However, this would cause confusion with \"Cascading Style Sheets,\" so usage of this acronym has declined significantly.\n\nDescription:\n\nThe product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.\n\nExtended Details:\n\n\n\nCross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:\n\n\n  1. Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.\n\n  1. The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.\n\n  1. During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.\n\n  1. A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.\n\n  1. Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.\n\n  1. This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.\n\nThere are three main kinds of XSS:\n\n  -  **Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent)**  - The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.\n\n  -  **Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent)**  - The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs. \n\n  -  **Type 0: DOM-Based XSS**  - In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible. \n\nOnce the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"\n\nIn many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-25926: Python Library Manager did not sufficiently neutralize a user-supplied search term, allowing reflected XSS.\n\n- CVE-2021-25963: Python-based e-commerce platform did not escape returned content on error pages, allowing for reflected Cross-Site Scripting attacks.\n\n- CVE-2021-1879: Universal XSS in mobile operating system, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2020-3580: Chain: improper input validation (CWE-20) in firewall product leads to XSS (CWE-79), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2014-8958: Admin GUI allows XSS through cookie.\n\n- CVE-2017-9764: Web stats program allows XSS through crafted HTTP header.\n\n- CVE-2014-5198: Web log analysis product allows XSS through crafted HTTP Referer header.\n\n- CVE-2008-5080: Chain: protection mechanism failure allows XSS\n\n- CVE-2006-4308: Chain: incomplete denylist (CWE-184) only checks \"javascript:\" tag, allowing XSS (CWE-79) using other tags\n\n- CVE-2007-5727: Chain: incomplete denylist (CWE-184) only removes SCRIPT tags, enabling XSS (CWE-79)\n\n- CVE-2008-5770: Reflected XSS using the PATH_INFO in a URL\n\n- CVE-2008-4730: Reflected XSS not properly handled when generating an error message\n\n- CVE-2008-5734: Reflected XSS sent through email message.\n\n- CVE-2008-0971: Stored XSS in a security product.\n\n- CVE-2008-5249: Stored XSS using a wiki page.\n\n- CVE-2006-3568: Stored XSS in a guestbook application.\n\n- CVE-2006-3211: Stored XSS in a guestbook application using a javascript: URI in a bbcode img tag.\n\n- CVE-2006-3295: Chain: library file is not protected against a direct request (CWE-425), leading to reflected XSS (CWE-79).\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-7050: Codologic Codoforum through 4.8.4 allows a DOM-based XSS. While creating a new topic as a normal user, it is possible to add a poll that is automatically loaded in the DOM once the thread/topic is opened. Because session cookies lack the HttpOnly flag, it is possible to steal authentication cookies and take over accounts.\n\n- CVE-2020-7051: Codologic Codoforum through 4.8.4 allows stored XSS in the login area. This is relevant in conjunction with CVE-2020-5842 because session cookies lack the HttpOnly flag. The impact is account takeover.\n\n- CVE-2021-1543: Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business 220 Series Smart Switches could allow an attacker to do the following: Hijack a user session Execute arbitrary commands as a root user on the underlying operating system Conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack Conduct an HTML injection attack For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2021-21260: Online Invoicing System (OIS) is open source software which is a lean invoicing system for small businesses, consultants and freelancers created using AppGini. In OIS version 4.0 there is a stored XSS which can enables an attacker takeover of the admin account through a payload that extracts a csrf token and sends a request to change password. It has been found that Item description is reflected without sanitization in app/items_view.php which enables the malicious scenario.\n\n- CVE-2021-21283: Flarum is an open source discussion platform for websites. The \"Flarum Sticky\" extension versions 0.1.0-beta.14 and 0.1.0-beta.15 has a cross-site scripting vulnerability. A change in release beta 14 of the Sticky extension caused the plain text content of the first post of a pinned discussion to be injected as HTML on the discussion list. The issue was discovered following an internal audit. Any HTML would be injected through the m.trust() helper. This resulted in an HTML injection where <script> tags would not be executed. However it was possible to run javascript from other HTML attributes, enabling a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack to be performed. Since the exploit only happens with the first post of a pinned discussion, an attacker would need the ability to pin their own discussion, or be able to edit a discussion that was previously pinned. On forums where all pinned posts are authored by your staff, you can be relatively certain the vulnerability has not been exploited. Forums where some user-created discussions were pinned can look at the first post edit date to find whether the vulnerability might have been exploited. Because Flarum doesn't store the post content history, you cannot be certain if a malicious edit was reverted. The fix will be available in version v0.1.0-beta.16 with Flarum beta 16. The fix has already been back-ported to Flarum beta 15 as version v0.1.0-beta.15.1 of the Sticky extension. Forum administrators can disable the Sticky extension until they are able to apply the update. The vulnerability cannot be exploited while the extension is disabled.\n\n- CVE-2021-21332: Synapse is a Matrix reference homeserver written in python (pypi package matrix-synapse). Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and VoIP. In Synapse before version 1.27.0, the password reset endpoint served via Synapse was vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. The impact depends on the configuration of the domain that Synapse is deployed on, but may allow access to cookies and other browser data, CSRF vulnerabilities, and access to other resources served on the same domain or parent domains. This is fixed in version 1.27.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-22223: Client-Side code injection through Feature Flag name in GitLab CE/EE starting with 11.9 allows a specially crafted feature flag name to PUT requests on behalf of other users via clicking on a link\n\n- CVE-2021-22722: A CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Stored Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability exists in EVlink City (EVC1S22P4 / EVC1S7P4 all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1), EVlink Parking (EVW2 / EVF2 / EV.2 all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1), and EVlink Smart Wallbox (EVB1A all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1 ) that could cause code injection when importing a CSV file or changing station parameters.\n\n- CVE-2021-22723: A CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation (Cross-siteScripting) through Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in EVlink City (EVC1S22P4 / EVC1S7P4 all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1), EVlink Parking (EVW2 / EVF2 / EV.2 all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1), and EVlink Smart Wallbox (EVB1A all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1 ) that could allow an attacker to impersonate the user who manages the charging station or carry out actions on their behalf when crafted malicious parameters are submitted to the charging station web server.\n\n- CVE-2021-24301: The Hotjar Connecticator WordPress plugin through 1.1.1 is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the 'hotjar script' textarea. The request did include a CSRF nonce that was properly verified by the server and this vulnerability could only be exploited by administrator users.\n\n- CVE-2021-24891: The Elementor Website Builder WordPress plugin before 3.4.8 does not sanitise or escape user input appended to the DOM via a malicious hash, resulting in a DOM Cross-Site Scripting issue.\n\n- CVE-2021-25955: In \u201cDolibarr ERP CRM\u201d, WYSIWYG Editor module, v2.8.1 to v13.0.2 are affected by a stored XSS vulnerability that allows low privileged application users to store malicious scripts in the \u201cPrivate Note\u201d field at \u201c/adherents/note.php?id=1\u201d endpoint. These scripts are executed in a victim\u2019s browser when they open the page containing the vulnerable field. In the worst case, the victim who inadvertently triggers the attack is a highly privileged administrator. The injected scripts can extract the Session ID, which can lead to full Account takeover of the admin and due to other vulnerability (Improper Access Control on Private notes) a low privileged user can update the private notes which could lead to privilege escalation.\n\n- CVE-2021-26929: An XSS issue was discovered in Horde Groupware Webmail Edition through 5.2.22 (where the Horde_Text_Filter library before 2.3.7 is used). The attacker can send a plain text e-mail message, with JavaScript encoded as a link or email that is mishandled by preProcess in Text2html.php, because bespoke use of \\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00 and \\\\x01\\\\x01\\\\x01 interferes with XSS defenses.\n\n- CVE-2021-29208: A remote dom xss, crlf injection vulnerability was discovered in HPE Integrated Lights-Out 4 (iLO 4); HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen9; HPE Integrated Lights-Out 5 (iLO 5) for HPE Gen10 Servers; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10; HPE SimpliVity 2600; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10 G; HPE SimpliVity 325; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10 H version(s): Prior to version 2.78.\n\n- CVE-2021-29209: A remote dom xss, crlf injection vulnerability was discovered in HPE Integrated Lights-Out 4 (iLO 4); HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen9; HPE Integrated Lights-Out 5 (iLO 5) for HPE Gen10 Servers; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10; HPE SimpliVity 2600; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10 G; HPE SimpliVity 325; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10 H version(s): Prior to version 2.78.\n\n- CVE-2021-29210: A remote dom xss, crlf injection vulnerability was discovered in HPE Integrated Lights-Out 4 (iLO 4); HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen9; HPE Integrated Lights-Out 5 (iLO 5) for HPE Gen10 Servers; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10; HPE SimpliVity 2600; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10 G; HPE SimpliVity 325; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10 H version(s): Prior to version 2.78.\n\n- CVE-2021-29459: XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. It is possible to persistently inject scripts in XWiki versions prior to 12.6.3 and 12.8. Unregistred users can fill simple text fields. Registered users can fill in their personal information and (if they have edit rights) fill the values of static lists using App Within Minutes. There is no easy workaround except upgrading XWiki. The vulnerability has been patched on XWiki 12.8 and 12.6.3.\n\n- CVE-2021-32772: Poddycast is a podcast app made with Electron. Prior to version 0.8.1, an attacker can create a podcast or episode with malicious characters and execute commands on the client machine. The application does not clean the HTML characters of the podcast information obtained from the Feed, which allows the injection of HTML and JS code (cross-site scripting). Being an application made in electron, cross-site scripting can be scaled to remote code execution, making it possible to execute commands on the machine where the application is running. The vulnerability is patched in Poddycast version 0.8.1.\n\n- CVE-2021-34656: The 2Way VideoCalls and Random Chat - HTML5 Webcam Videochat WordPress plugin is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the `vws_notice` function found in the ~/inc/requirements.php file which allows attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts, in versions up to and including 5.2.7.\n\n- CVE-2021-34763: Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software could allow an attacker to execute a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack or an open redirect attack. For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2021-34821: Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in AAT Novus Management System through 1.51.2. The WebUI has wrong HTTP 404 error handling implemented. A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to exploit the issue by sending malicious HTTP requests to non-existing URIs. The value of the URL path filename is copied into the HTML document as plain text tags.\n\n- CVE-2021-3529: A flaw was found in noobaa-core in versions before 5.7.0. This flaw results in the name of an arbitrarily URL being copied into an HTML document as plain text between tags, including potentially a payload script. The input was echoed unmodified in the application response, resulting in arbitrary JavaScript being injected into an application's response. The highest threat to the system is for confidentiality, availability, and integrity.\n\n- CVE-2021-39186: GlobalNewFiles is a MediaWiki extension maintained by Miraheze. Prior to commit number cee254e1b158cdb0ddbea716b1d3edc31fa4fb5d, the username column of the GlobalNewFiles special page is vulnerable to a stored XSS. Commit number cee254e1b158cdb0ddbea716b1d3edc31fa4fb5d contains a patch. As a workaround, one may disallow <,> (or other characters required to insert html/js) from being used in account names so an XSS is not possible.\n\n- CVE-2021-37541: In JetBrains Hub before 2021.1.13402, HTML injection in the password reset email was possible.\n\n- CVE-2021-34419: In the Zoom Client for Meetings for Ubuntu Linux before version 5.1.0, there is an HTML injection flaw when sending a remote control request to a user in the process of in-meeting screen sharing. This could allow meeting participants to be targeted for social engineering attacks.\n\n- CVE-2021-30057: A stored HTML injection vulnerability exists in Knowage Suite version 7.1. An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML in \"/restful-services/2.0/analyticalDrivers\" via the 'LABEL' and 'NAME' parameters.\n\n- CVE-2021-22232: HTML injection was possible via the full name field before versions 13.11.6, 13.12.6, and 14.0.2 in GitLab CE\n\n- CVE-2020-23050: TAO Open Source Assessment Platform v3.3.0 RC02 was discovered to contain a HTML injection vulnerability in the userFirstName parameter of the user account input field. This vulnerability allows attackers to execute phishing attacks, external redirects, and arbitrary code.\n\n- CVE-2021-39348: The LearnPress WordPress plugin is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting due to insufficient escaping on the $custom_profile parameter found in the ~/inc/admin/views/backend-user-profile.php file which allowed attackers with administrative user access to inject arbitrary web scripts, in versions up to and including 4.1.3.1. This affects multi-site installations where unfiltered_html is disabled for administrators, and sites where unfiltered_html is disabled. Please note that this is seperate from CVE-2021-24702.\n\n- CVE-2021-21333: Synapse is a Matrix reference homeserver written in python (pypi package matrix-synapse). Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and VoIP. In Synapse before version 1.27.0, the notification emails sent for notifications for missed messages or for an expiring account are subject to HTML injection. In the case of the notification for missed messages, this could allow an attacker to insert forged content into the email. The account expiry feature is not enabled by default and the HTML injection is not controllable by an attacker. This is fixed in version 1.27.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-42663: An HTML injection vulnerability exists in Sourcecodester Online Event Booking and Reservation System in PHP/MySQL via the msg parameter to /event-management/index.php. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability in order to change the visibility of the website. Once the target user clicks on a given link he will display the content of the HTML code of the attacker's choice.\n\n- CVE-2021-41248: GraphiQL is the reference implementation of this monorepo, GraphQL IDE, an official project under the GraphQL Foundation. All versions of graphiql older than graphiql@1.4.7 are vulnerable to compromised HTTP schema introspection responses or schema prop values with malicious GraphQL type names, exposing a dynamic XSS attack surface that can allow code injection on operation autocomplete. In order for the attack to take place, the user must load a vulnerable schema in graphiql. There are a number of ways that can occur. By default, the schema URL is not attacker-controllable in graphiql or in its suggested implementations or examples, leaving only very complex attack vectors. If a custom implementation of graphiql's fetcher allows the schema URL to be set dynamically, such as a URL query parameter like ?endpoint= in graphql-playground, or a database provided value, then this custom graphiql implementation is vulnerable to phishing attacks, and thus much more readily available, low or no privelege level xss attacks. The URLs could look like any generic looking graphql schema URL. It should be noted that desktop clients such as Altair, Insomnia, Postwoman, do not appear to be impacted by this. This vulnerability does not impact codemirror-graphql, monaco-graphql or other dependents, as it exists in onHasCompletion.ts in graphiql. It does impact all forks of graphiql, and every released version of graphiql.\n\n- CVE-2021-41249: GraphQL Playground is a GraphQL IDE for development of graphQL focused applications. All versions of graphql-playground-react older than graphql-playground-react@1.7.28 are vulnerable to compromised HTTP schema introspection responses or schema prop values with malicious GraphQL type names, exposing a dynamic XSS attack surface that can allow code injection on operation autocomplete. In order for the attack to take place, the user must load a malicious schema in graphql-playground. There are several ways this can occur, including by specifying the URL to a malicious schema in the endpoint query parameter. If a user clicks on a link to a GraphQL Playground installation that specifies a malicious server, arbitrary JavaScript can run in the user's browser, which can be used to exfiltrate user credentials or other harmful goals. If you are using graphql-playground-react directly in your client app, upgrade to version 1.7.28 or later.\n\n- CVE-2021-41825: Verint Workforce Optimization (WFO) 15.2.5.1033 allows HTML injection via the /wfo/control/signin username parameter.\n\n- CVE-2021-42564: An open redirect through HTML injection in confidential messages in Cryptshare before 5.1.0 allows remote attackers (with permission to provide confidential messages via Cryptshare) to redirect targeted victims to any URL via the '<meta http-equiv=\"refresh\"' substring in the editor parameter.\n\n- CVE-2021-43683: pictshare v1.5 is affected by a Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in api/info.php. The exit function will terminate the script and print the message which has $_REQUEST['hash'].\n\n- CVE-2021-31682: The login portal for the Automated Logic WebCTRL/WebCTRL OEM web application contains a vulnerability that allows for reflected XSS attacks due to the operatorlocale GET parameter not being sanitized. This issue impacts versions 6.5 and below.

Argo CD starting with 2.3.0 and prior to 2.3.6 and 2.4.5 is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting (XSS) bug which could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript in the `/auth/callback` page in a victim's browser. This vulnerability only affects Argo CD instances which have single sign on (SSO) enabled. The exploit also assumes the attacker has 1) access to the API server's encryption key, 2) a method to add a cookie to the victim's browser, and 3) the ability to convince the victim to visit a malicious `/auth/callback` link. The vulnerability is classified as low severity because access to the API server's encryption key already grants a high level of access. Exploiting the XSS would allow the attacker to impersonate the victim, but would not grant any privileges which the attacker could not otherwise gain using the encryption key. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in the following Argo CD versions 2.4.5 and 2.3.6. There is currently no known workaround.\n\n- CVE-2022-3242: Code Injection in GitHub repository microweber/microweber prior to 1.3.2.\n\n- CVE-2022-32763: A cross-site scripting (xss) sanitization vulnerability bypass exists in the SanitizeHtml functionality of Lansweeper lansweeper 10.1.1.0.

The victim's encrypted password can be stolen and most likely be decrypted.\n\n- CVE-2022-45004: Gophish through 0.12.1 was discovered to contain a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability via a crafted landing page.\n\n- CVE-2022-45411: Cross-Site Tracing occurs when a server will echo a request back via the Trace method, allowing an XSS attack to access to authorization headers and cookies inaccessible to JavaScript (such as cookies protected by HTTPOnly). To mitigate this attack, browsers placed limits on <code>fetch()</code> and XMLHttpRequest; however some webservers have implemented non-standard headers such as <code>X-Http-Method-Override</code> that override the HTTP method, and made this attack possible again. Thunderbird has applied the same mitigations to the use of this and similar headers. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 102.5, Thunderbird < 102.5, and Firefox < 107.\n\n- CVE-2022-39207: Onedev is an open source, self-hosted Git Server with CI/CD and Kanban. During CI/CD builds, it is possible to save build artifacts for later retrieval. They can be accessed through OneDev's web UI after the successful run of a build. These artifact files are served by the webserver in the same context as the UI without any further restrictions. This leads to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) when a user creates a build artifact that contains HTML. When accessing the artifact, the content is rendered by the browser, including any JavaScript that it contains. Since all cookies (except for the rememberMe one) do not set the HttpOnly flag, an attacker could steal the session of a victim and use it to impersonate them. To exploit this issue, attackers need to be able to modify the content of artifacts, which usually means they need to be able to modify a project's build spec. The exploitation requires the victim to click on an attacker's link. It can be used to elevate privileges by targeting admins of a OneDev instance. In the worst case, this can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server, because admins can create Server Shell Executors and use them to run any command on the server. This issue has been patched in version 7.3.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-3033: If a Thunderbird user replied to a crafted HTML email containing a <code>meta</code> tag, with the <code>meta</code> tag having the <code>http-equiv=\"refresh\"</code> attribute, and the content attribute specifying an URL, then Thunderbird started a network request to that URL, regardless of the configuration to block remote content. In combination with certain other HTML elements and attributes in the email, it was possible to execute JavaScript code included in the message in the context of the message compose document. The JavaScript code was able to perform actions including, but probably not limited to, read and modify the contents of the message compose document, including the quoted original message, which could potentially contain the decrypted plaintext of encrypted data in the crafted email. The contents could then be transmitted to the network, either to the URL specified in the META refresh tag, or to a different URL, as the JavaScript code could modify the URL specified in the document. This bug doesn't affect users who have changed the default Message Body display setting to 'simple html' or 'plain text'. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 102.2.1 and Thunderbird < 91.13.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-29444: Plugin Settings Change leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Cloudways Breeze plugin <= 2.0.2 on WordPress allows users with a subscriber or higher user role to execute any of the wp_ajax_* actions in the class Breeze_Configuration which includes the ability to change any of the plugin's settings including CDN setting which could be further used for XSS attack.\n\n- CVE-2021-36176: Multiple uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerabilities in the web interface of FortiPortal before 6.0.6 may allow a single low-privileged user to induce a denial of service via multiple HTTP requests.\n\n- CVE-2021-43929: Improper neutralization of special elements in output used by a downstream component ('Injection') vulnerability in work flow management in Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM) before 7.0.1-42218-2 allows remote authenticated users to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via unspecified vectors.\n\n- CVE-2022-2178: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in Saysis Computer Starcities allows Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).This issue affects Starcities: before 1.1. \n\n- CVE-2022-38628: Nortek Linear eMerge E3-Series 0.32-08f, 0.32-07p, 0.32-07e, 0.32-09c, 0.32-09b, 0.32-09a, and 0.32-08e were discovered to contain a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability which is chained with a local session fixation.

An attacker is able to inject arbitrary `CSS` into the generated graph allowing them to change the styling of elements outside of the generated graph, and potentially exfiltrate sensitive information by using specially crafted `CSS` selectors. The following example shows how an attacker can exfiltrate the contents of an input field by bruteforcing the `value` attribute one character at a time. Whenever there is an actual match, an `http` request will be made by the browser in order to \"load\" a background image that will let an attacker know what's the value of the character. This issue may lead to `Information Disclosure` via CSS selectors and functions able to generate HTTP requests. This also allows an attacker to change the document in ways which may lead a user to perform unintended actions, such as clicking on a link, etc. This issue has been resolved in version 9.1.3. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that user input is adequately escaped before embedding it in CSS blocks.\n\n- CVE-2022-32269: In Real Player 20.0.8.310, the G2 Control allows injection of unsafe javascript: URIs in local HTTP error pages (displayed by Internet Explorer core).

These special elements can carry control implications. If product does not prevent external control or influence over the inclusion of such special elements, the control flow of the program may be altered from what was intended. For example, both Unix and Windows interpret the symbol < (\"less than\") as meaning \"read input from a file\".\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2001-0677: Read arbitrary files from mail client by providing a special MIME header that is internally used to store pathnames for attachments.\n\n- CVE-2000-0703: Setuid program does not cleanse special escape sequence before sending data to a mail program, causing the mail program to process those sequences.\n\n- CVE-2003-0020: Multi-channel issue. Terminal escape sequences not filtered from log files.\n\n- CVE-2003-0083: Multi-channel issue. Terminal escape sequences not filtered from log files.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-33592: NAVER Toolbar before 4.0.30.323 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted upgrade.xml file. Special characters in filename parameter can be the cause of bypassing code signing check function.\n\n- CVE-2022-0661: The Ad Injection WordPress plugin through 1.2.0.19 does not properly sanitize the body of the adverts injected into the pages, allowing a high privileged user (Admin+) to inject arbitrary HTML or javascript even with unfiltered_html disallowed, leading to a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Further it is also possible to inject PHP code, leading to a Remote Code execution (RCE) vulnerability, even if the DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT and DISALLOW_FILE_MOD constants are both set.\n\n- CVE-2022-35651: A stored XSS and blind SSRF vulnerability was found in Moodle, occurs due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied data in the SCORM track details. A remote attacker can trick the victim to follow a specially crafted link and execute arbitrary HTML and script code in user's browser in context of vulnerable website to steal potentially sensitive information, change appearance of the web page, can perform phishing and drive-by-download attacks.\n\n- CVE-2022-36325: Affected devices do not properly sanitize data introduced by an user when rendering the web interface. This could allow an authenticated remote attacker with administrative privileges to inject code and lead to a DOM-based XSS.\n\n- CVE-2022-4029: The Simple:Press plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the 'sforum_[md5 hash of the WordPress URL]' cookie value in versions up to, and including, 6.8 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link. This would be highly complex to exploit as it would require the attacker to set the cookie a cookie for the targeted user.\n\n- CVE-2022-24720: image_processing is an image processing wrapper for libvips and ImageMagick/GraphicsMagick. Prior to version 1.12.2, using the `#apply` method from image_processing to apply a series of operations that are coming from unsanitized user input allows the attacker to execute shell commands. This method is called internally by Active Storage variants, so Active Storage is vulnerable as well. The vulnerability has been fixed in version 1.12.2 of image_processing. As a workaround, users who process based on user input should always sanitize the user input by allowing only a constrained set of operations.\n\n- CVE-2021-25296: Nagios XI version xi-5.7.5 is affected by OS command injection. The vulnerability exists in the file /usr/local/nagiosxi/html/includes/configwizards/windowswmi/windowswmi.inc.php due to improper sanitization of authenticated user-controlled input by a single HTTP request, which can lead to OS command injection on the Nagios XI server.\n\n- CVE-2021-25297: Nagios XI version xi-5.7.5 is affected by OS command injection.

In response to CVE-2020-27839, the JWT token was moved from localStorage to an httpOnly cookie. However, token cookies are used in the body of the HTTP response for the documentation, which again makes it available to XSS.The greatest threat to the system is for confidentiality, integrity, and availability.\n\n- CVE-2021-34771: A vulnerability in the Cisco IOS XR Software CLI could allow an authenticated, local attacker to view more information than their privileges allow. This vulnerability is due to insufficient application of restrictions during the execution of a specific command. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by running a specific command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view sensitive configuration information that their privileges might not otherwise allow them to access.\n\n- CVE-2021-25122: When responding to new h2c connection requests, Apache Tomcat versions 10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.0, 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.41 and 8.5.0 to 8.5.61 could duplicate request headers and a limited amount of request body from one request to another meaning user A and user B could both see the results of user A's request.\n\n- CVE-2021-0644: In conditionallyRemoveIdentifiers of SubscriptionController.java, there is a possible way to retrieve a trackable identifier due to a missing permission check. This could lead to local information disclosure with User execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-11 Android-10Android ID: A-181053462\n\n- CVE-2020-11922: An issue was discovered in WiZ Colors A60 1.14.0. The device sends unnecessary information to the cloud controller server. Although this information is sent encrypted and has low risk in isolation, it decreases the privacy of the end user. The information sent includes the local IP address being used and the SSID of the Wi-Fi network the device is connected to. (Various resources such as wigle.net can be use for mapping of SSIDs to physical locations.)\n\n- CVE-2021-24170: The REST API endpoint get_users in the User Profile Picture WordPress plugin before 2.5.0 returned more information than was required for its functionality to users with the upload_files capability. This included password hashes, hashed user activation keys, usernames, emails, and other less sensitive information.\n\n- CVE-2021-24585: The Timetable and Event Schedule WordPress plugin before 2.4.0 outputs the Hashed Password, Username and Email Address (along other less sensitive data) of the user related to the Even Head of the Timeslot in the response when requesting the event Timeslot data with a user with the edit_posts capability. Combined with the other Unauthorised Event Timeslot Modification issue (https://wpscan.com/reports/submissions/4699/) where an arbitrary user ID can be set, this could allow low privilege users with the edit_posts capability (such as author) to retrieve sensitive User data by iterating over the user_id\n\n- CVE-2021-26566: Insertion of sensitive information into sent data vulnerability in synorelayd in Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM) before 6.2.3-25426-3 allows man-in-the-middle attackers to execute arbitrary commands via inbound QuickConnect traffic.\n\n- CVE-2021-22172: Improper authorization in GitLab 12.8+ allows a guest user in a private project to view tag data that should be inaccessible on the releases page\n\n- CVE-2021-26923: An issue was discovered in Argo CD before 1.8.4.

A compromised pod with sufficient privilege is able to reconfigure the node\u2019s IPv6 interface due to the node accepting route advertisement by default, allowing the attacker to redirect full or partial network traffic from the node to the compromised pod.\n\n- CVE-2020-14371: A credential leak vulnerability was found in Red Hat Satellite. This flaw exposes the compute resources credentials through VMs that are running on these resources in Satellite.\n\n- CVE-2021-20228: A flaw was found in the Ansible Engine 2.9.18, where sensitive info is not masked by default and is not protected by the no_log feature when using the sub-option feature of the basic.py module. This flaw allows an attacker to obtain sensitive information. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality.\n\n- CVE-2021-20331:  Specific versions of the MongoDB C# Driver may erroneously publish events containing authentication-related data to a command listener configured by an application. The published events may contain security-sensitive data when commands such as \"saslStart\", \"saslContinue\", \"isMaster\", \"createUser\", and \"updateUser\" are executed. Without due care, an application may inadvertently expose this authenticated-related information, e.g., by writing it to a log file. This issue only arises if an application enables the command listener feature (this is not enabled by default). This issue affects the MongoDB C# Driver v2.12 versions prior to and including 2.12.1. \n\n- CVE-2021-26593: In Directus 8.x through 8.8.1, an attacker can see all users in the CMS using the API /users/{id}. For each call, they get in response a lot of information about the user (such as email address, first name, and last name) but also the secret for 2FA if one exists. This secret can be regenerated. NOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer\n\n- CVE-2021-28133: Zoom through 5.5.4 sometimes allows attackers to read private information on a participant's screen, even though the participant never attempted to share the private part of their screen. When a user shares a specific application window via the Share Screen functionality, other meeting participants can briefly see contents of other application windows that were explicitly not shared. The contents of these other windows can (for instance) be seen for a short period of time when they overlay the shared window and get into focus. (An attacker can, of course, use a separate screen-recorder application, unsupported by Zoom, to save all such contents for later replays and analysis.) Depending on the unintentionally shared data, this short exposure of screen contents may be a more or less severe security issue.\n\n- CVE-2021-29483: ManageWiki is an extension to the MediaWiki project. The 'wikiconfig' API leaked the value of private configuration variables set through the ManageWiki variable to all users. This has been patched by https://github.com/miraheze/ManageWiki/compare/99f3b2c8af18...befb83c66f5b.patch. If you are unable to patch set `$wgAPIListModules['wikiconfig'] = 'ApiQueryDisabled';` or remove private config as a workaround.\n\n- CVE-2021-31545: An issue was discovered in the AbuseFilter extension for MediaWiki through 1.35.2.

The Special:AbuseFilter/examine form allowed for the disclosure of suppressed MediaWiki usernames to unprivileged users.\n\n- CVE-2021-32747: Icinga Web 2 is an open source monitoring web interface, framework, and command-line interface. A vulnerability in which custom variables are exposed to unauthorized users exists between versions 2.0.0 and 2.8.2. Custom variables are user-defined keys and values on configuration objects in Icinga 2. These are commonly used to reference secrets in other configurations such as check commands to be able to authenticate with a service being checked. Icinga Web 2 displays these custom variables to logged in users with access to said hosts or services. In order to protect the secrets from being visible to anyone, it's possible to setup protection rules and blacklists in a user's role. Protection rules result in `***` being shown instead of the original value, the key will remain. Backlists will hide a custom variable entirely from the user. Besides using the UI, custom variables can also be accessed differently by using an undocumented URL parameter. By adding a parameter to the affected routes, Icinga Web 2 will show these columns additionally in the respective list. This parameter is also respected when exporting to JSON or CSV. Protection rules and blacklists however have no effect in this case. Custom variables are shown as-is in the result. The issue has been fixed in the 2.9.0, 2.8.3, and 2.7.5 releases. As a workaround, one may set up a restriction to hide hosts and services with the custom variable in question.\n\n- CVE-2020-27831: A flaw was found in Red Hat Quay, where it does not properly protect the authorization token when authorizing email addresses for repository email notifications. This flaw allows an attacker to add email addresses they do not own to repository notifications.\n\n- CVE-2021-21396: wire-server is an open-source back end for Wire, a secure collaboration platform. In wire-server from version 2021-02-16 and before version 2021-03-02, the client metadata of all users was exposed in the `GET /users/list-clients` endpoint. The endpoint could be used by any logged in user who could request client details of any other user (no connection required) as far as they can find their User ID. The exposed metadata included id, class, type, location, time, and cookie. A user on a Wire backend could use this endpoint to find registration time and location for each device for a given list of users. As a workaround, remove `/list-clients` from nginx config. This has been fixed in version 2021-03-02.\n\n- CVE-2021-21400: wire-webapp is an open-source front end for Wire, a secure collaboration platform. In wire-webapp before version 2021-03-15-production.0, when being prompted to enter the app-lock passphrase, the typed passphrase will be sent into the most recently used chat when the user does not actively give focus to the input field. Input element focus is enforced programatically in version 2021-03-15-production.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-21621: Jenkins Support Core Plugin 2.72 and earlier provides the serialized user authentication as part of the \"About user (basic authentication details only)\" information, which can include the session ID of the user creating the support bundle in some configurations.\n\n- CVE-2021-21733: The management system of ZXCDN is impacted by the information leak vulnerability.

Prior to version 4.10.4, for regular (non-LiveQuery) queries, the session token is removed from the response, but for LiveQuery payloads it is currently not. If a user has a LiveQuery subscription on the `Parse.User` class, all session tokens created during user sign-ups will be broadcast as part of the LiveQuery payload. A patch in version 4.10.4 removes session tokens from the LiveQuery payload. As a workaround, set `user.acl(new Parse.ACL())` in a beforeSave trigger to make the user private already on sign-up.\n\n- CVE-2021-41125: Scrapy is a high-level web crawling and scraping framework for Python. If you use `HttpAuthMiddleware` (i.e. the `http_user` and `http_pass` spider attributes) for HTTP authentication, all requests will expose your credentials to the request target. This includes requests generated by Scrapy components, such as `robots.txt` requests sent by Scrapy when the `ROBOTSTXT_OBEY` setting is set to `True`, or as requests reached through redirects. Upgrade to Scrapy 2.5.1 and use the new `http_auth_domain` spider attribute to control which domains are allowed to receive the configured HTTP authentication credentials. If you are using Scrapy 1.8 or a lower version, and upgrading to Scrapy 2.5.1 is not an option, you may upgrade to Scrapy 1.8.1 instead. If you cannot upgrade, set your HTTP authentication credentials on a per-request basis, using for example the `w3lib.http.basic_auth_header` function to convert your credentials into a value that you can assign to the `Authorization` header of your request, instead of defining your credentials globally using `HttpAuthMiddleware`.\n\n- CVE-2021-42089: An issue was discovered in Zammad before 4.1.1. The REST API discloses sensitive information.\n\n- CVE-2021-0602: In onCreateOptionsMenu of WifiNetworkDetailsFragment.java, there is a possible way for guest users to view and modify Wi-Fi settings for all configured APs due to a permissions bypass. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-10 Android-11Android ID: A-177573895\n\n- CVE-2021-37703: Discourse is an open-source platform for community discussion.

When the scs-library-client is used to pull a container image, with authentication, the HTTP Authorization header sent by the client to the library service may be incorrectly leaked to an S3 backing storage provider. This occurs in a specific flow, where the library service redirects the client to a backing S3 storage server, to perform a multi-part concurrent download. Depending on site configuration, the S3 service may be provided by a third party. An attacker with access to the S3 service may be able to extract user credentials, allowing them to impersonate the user. The vulnerable multi-part concurrent download flow, with redirect to S3, is only used when communicating with a Singularity Enterprise 1.x installation, or third party server implementing this flow. Interaction with Singularity Enterprise 2.x, and Singularity Container Services (cloud.sylabs.io), does not trigger the vulnerable flow. We encourage all users to update. Users who interact with a Singularity Enterprise 1.x installation, using a 3rd party S3 storage service, are advised to revoke and recreate their authentication tokens within Singularity Enterprise. There is no workaround available at this time.\n\n- CVE-2022-31130: Grafana is an open source observability and data visualization platform. Versions of Grafana for endpoints prior to 9.1.8 and 8.5.14 could leak authentication tokens to some destination plugins under some conditions. The vulnerability impacts data source and plugin proxy endpoints with authentication tokens. The destination plugin could receive a user's Grafana authentication token. Versions 9.1.8 and 8.5.14 contain a patch for this issue. As a workaround, do not use API keys, JWT authentication, or any HTTP Header based authentication.\n\n- CVE-2022-42132: The Test LDAP Users functionality in Liferay Portal 7.0.0 through 7.4.3.4, and Liferay DXP 7.0 fix pack 102 and earlier, 7.1 before fix pack 27, 7.2 before fix pack 17, 7.3 before update 4, and DXP 7.4 GA includes the LDAP credential in the page URL when paginating through the list of users, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers or attackers with access to the request logs to see the LDAP credential.\n\n- CVE-2022-31746: Internal URLs are protected by a secret UUID key, which could have been leaked to web page through the Referrer header. This vulnerability affects Firefox for iOS < 102.\n\n- CVE-2021-23937: A DNS proxy and possible amplification attack vulnerability in WebClientInfo of Apache Wicket allows an attacker to trigger arbitrary DNS lookups from the server when the X-Forwarded-For header is not properly sanitized. This DNS lookup can be engineered to overload an internal DNS server or to slow down request processing of the Apache Wicket application causing a possible denial of service on either the internal infrastructure or the web application itself. This issue affects Apache Wicket Apache Wicket 9.x version 9.2.0 and prior versions; Apache Wicket 8.x version 8.11.0 and prior versions; Apache Wicket 7.x version 7.17.0 and prior versions and Apache Wicket 6.x version 6.2.0 and later versions.\n\n- CVE-2022-0474: Full list of recipients from customer users in a contact field could be disclosed in notification emails event when the notification is set to be sent to each recipient individually.

There are currently no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-31069: NestJS Proxy is a NestJS module to decorate and proxy calls. Prior to version 0.7.0, the nestjs-proxy library did not have a way to control when Authorization headers should should be forwarded for specific backend services configured by the application developer. This could have resulted in sensitive information such as OAuth bearer access tokens being inadvertently exposed to such services that should not see them. A new feature has been introduced in the patched version of nestjs-proxy that allows application developers to opt out of forwarding the Authorization headers on a per service basis using the `forwardToken` config setting. Developers are advised to review the README for this library on Github or NPM for further details on how this configuration can be applied. This issue has been fixed in version 0.7.0 of `@finastra/nestjs-proxy`. Users of `@ffdc/nestjs-proxy` are advised that this package has been deprecated and is no longer being maintained or receiving updates. Such users should update their package.json file to use `@finastra/nestjs-proxy` instead.\n\n- CVE-2022-31070: NestJS Proxy is a NestJS module to decorate and proxy calls. Prior to version 0.7.0, the nestjs-proxy library did not have a way to block sensitive cookies (e.g. session cookies) from being forwarded to backend services configured by the application developer. This could have led to sensitive cookies being inadvertently exposed to such services that should not see them. The patched version now blocks cookies from being forwarded by default. However developers can configure an allow-list of cookie names by using the `allowedCookies` config setting. This issue has been fixed in version 0.7.0 of `@finastra/nestjs-proxy`. Users of `@ffdc/nestjs-proxy` are advised that this package has been deprecated and is no longer being maintained or receiving updates. Such users should update their package.json file to use `@finastra/nestjs-proxy` instead.\n\n- CVE-2022-3348: Just like in the previous report, an attacker could steal the account of different users. But in this case, it's a little bit more specific, because it is needed to be an editor in the same app as the victim.\n\n- CVE-2022-38113: This vulnerability discloses build and services versions in the server response header. \n\n- CVE-2022-46150: Discourse is an open-source discussion platform. Prior to version 2.8.13 of the `stable` branch and version 2.9.0.beta14 of the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches, unauthorized users may learn of the existence of hidden tags and that they have been applied to topics that they have access to. This issue is patched in version 2.8.13 of the `stable` branch and version 2.9.0.beta14 of the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches. As a workaround, use the `disable_email` site setting to disable all emails to non-staff users.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-200 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-209 (CanAlsoBe)\n\n- CWE-202 (CanAlsoBe)",

Some CMS (Content Management Systems) also use templates.\n\n\nTemplate engines often have their own custom command or expression language. If an attacker can influence input into a template before it is processed, then the attacker can invoke arbitrary expressions, i.e. perform injection attacks. For example, in some template languages, an attacker could inject the expression \"{{7*7}}\" and determine if the output returns \"49\" instead. The syntax varies depending on the language.\n\n\nIn some cases, XSS-style attacks can work, which can obscure the root cause if the developer does not closely investigate the root cause of the error.\n\n\nTemplate engines can be used on the server or client, so both \"sides\" could be affected by injection. The mechanisms of attack or the affected technologies might be different, but the mistake is fundamentally the same.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2024-34359: Chain: Python bindings for LLM library do not use a sandboxed environment when parsing a template and constructing a prompt, allowing jinja2 Server Side Template Injection and code execution - one variant of a \"prompt injection\" attack.\n\n- CVE-2017-16783: server-side template injection in content management server\n\n- CVE-2020-9437: authentication / identity management product has client-side template injection\n\n- CVE-2020-12790: Server-Side Template Injection using a Twig template\n\n- CVE-2021-21244: devops platform allows SSTI\n\n- CVE-2020-4027: bypass of Server-Side Template Injection protection mechanism with macros in Velocity templates\n\n- CVE-2020-26282: web browser proxy server allows Java EL expressions from Server-Side Template Injection\n\n- CVE-2020-1961: SSTI involving mail templates and JEXL expressions\n\n- CVE-2019-19999: product does not use a \"safe\" setting for a FreeMarker configuration, allowing SSTI\n\n- CVE-2018-20465: product allows read of sensitive database username/password variables using server-side template injection\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-25283: An issue was discovered in through SaltStack Salt before 3002.5.

More specifically, the layout parameter may trigger file disclosure vulnerabilities in downstream applications. This potential vulnerability is somewhat restricted in that only files with existing extentions (i.e. file.extension) can be included, files that lack an extension will have .hbs appended to them. For complete details refer to the referenced GHSL-2021-019 report. Notes in documentation have been added to help users of express-hbs avoid this potential information exposure vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2021-32820: Express-handlebars is a Handlebars view engine for Express. Express-handlebars mixes pure template data with engine configuration options through the Express render API. More specifically, the layout parameter may trigger file disclosure vulnerabilities in downstream applications. This potential vulnerability is somewhat restricted in that only files with existing extentions (i.e. file.extension) can be included, files that lack an extension will have .handlebars appended to them.

For an example PoC see the referenced GHSL-2021-020.\n\n- CVE-2021-29454: Smarty is a template engine for PHP, facilitating the separation of presentation (HTML/CSS) from application logic. Prior to versions 3.1.42 and 4.0.2, template authors could run arbitrary PHP code by crafting a malicious math string. If a math string was passed through as user provided data to the math function, external users could run arbitrary PHP code by crafting a malicious math string. Users should upgrade to version 3.1.42 or 4.0.2 to receive a patch.\n\n- CVE-2021-32649: October CMS is a self-hosted content management system (CMS) platform based on the Laravel PHP Framework. Prior to versions 1.0.473 and 1.1.6, an attacker with \"create, modify and delete website pages\" privileges in the backend is able to execute PHP code by running specially crafted Twig code in the template markup. The issue has been patched in Build 473 (v1.0.473) and v1.1.6. Those unable to upgrade may apply the patch to their installation manually as a workaround.\n\n- CVE-2021-43097: A Server-side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerability exists in bbs 5.3 in TemplateManageAction.javawhich could let a malicoius user execute arbitrary code.\n\n- CVE-2021-43837: vault-cli is a configurable command-line interface tool (and python library) to interact with Hashicorp Vault. In versions before 3.0.0 vault-cli features the ability for rendering templated values. When a secret starts with the prefix `!template!`, vault-cli interprets the rest of the contents of the secret as a Jinja2 template. Jinja2 is a powerful templating engine and is not designed to safely render arbitrary templates. An attacker controlling a jinja2 template rendered on a machine can trigger arbitrary code, making this a Remote Code Execution (RCE) risk. If the content of the vault can be completely trusted, then this is not a problem. Otherwise, if your threat model includes cases where an attacker can manipulate a secret value read from the vault using vault-cli, then this vulnerability may impact you. In 3.0.0, the code related to interpreting vault templated secrets has been removed entirely. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. For users unable to upgrade a workaround does exist. Using the environment variable `VAULT_CLI_RENDER=false` or the flag `--no-render` (placed between `vault-cli` and the subcommand, e.g. `vault-cli --no-render get-all`) or adding `render: false` to the vault-cli configuration yaml file disables rendering and removes the vulnerability. Using the python library, you can use: `vault_cli.get_client(render=False)` when creating your client to get a client that will not render templated secrets and thus operates securely.\n\n- CVE-2021-46063: MCMS v5.2.5 was discovered to contain a Server Side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerability via the Template Management module.\n\n- CVE-2021-40219: Bolt CMS <= 4.2 is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution.

This is fairly common when using key-based access to resources in a multi-user context.\n\nDescription:\n\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\nExtended Details:\n\n\n\nRetrieval of a user record occurs in the system based on some key value that is under user control. The key would typically identify a user-related record stored in the system and would be used to lookup that record for presentation to the user. It is likely that an attacker would have to be an authenticated user in the system. However, the authorization process would not properly check the data access operation to ensure that the authenticated user performing the operation has sufficient entitlements to perform the requested data access, hence bypassing any other authorization checks present in the system.\n\n\nFor example, attackers can look at places where user specific data is retrieved (e.g. search screens) and determine whether the key for the item being looked up is controllable externally. The key may be a hidden field in the HTML form field, might be passed as a URL parameter or as an unencrypted cookie variable, then in each of these cases it will be possible to tamper with the key value.\n\n\nOne manifestation of this weakness is when a system uses sequential or otherwise easily-guessable session IDs that would allow one user to easily switch to another user's session and read/modify their data.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-36539: An educational application does not appropriately restrict file IDs to a particular user. The attacker can brute-force guess IDs, indicating IDOR.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-26679: vFairs 3.3 is affected by Insecure Permissions.

Several APIs on the web system display, without authorization, sensitive information such as health statements, previous bills in a specific restaurant, alcohol consumption and smoking habits. Each of the described API\u2019s, has in its URL one or more MongoDB ID which is not so simple to enumerate. However, they each receive a \u2018tiny URL\u2019 in Tabit\u2019s domain, in the form of https://tbit.be/{suffix} with suffix being a 5 characters long string containing numbers, lower- and upper-case letters. It is not so simple to enumerate them all, but really easy to find some that work and lead to a personal endpoint. This is both an example of OWASP: API4 - rate limiting and OWASP: API1 - Broken object level authorization. Furthermore, the redirect URL disclosed the MongoDB IDs discussed above, and we could use them to query other endpoints disclosing more personal information. For example: The URL https://tabitisrael.co.il/online-reservations/health-statement?orgId={org_id}&healthStatementId={health_statement_id} is used to invite friends to fill a health statement before attending the restaurant. We can use the health_statement_id to access the https://tgm-api.tabit.cloud/health-statement/{health_statement_id} API which disclose medical information as well as id number.\n\n- CVE-2022-36202: Doctor's Appointment System1.0 is vulnerable to Incorrect Access Control via edoc/patient/settings.php.

A sync token is used in Seafile file syncing protocol to authorize access to library data. To improve performance, the token is cached in memory in seaf-server. Upon receiving a token from sync client or SeaDrive client, the server checks whether the token exist in the cache. However, if the token exists in cache, the server doesn't check whether it's associated with the specific library in the URL. This vulnerability makes it possible to use any valid sync token to access data from any **known** library. Note that the attacker has to first find out the ID of a library which it has no access to. The library ID is a random UUID, which is not possible to be guessed. There are no workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-1949: An access control bypass vulnerability found in 389-ds-base.

This assumption may be even stronger when the programmer has encoded the command in a way that prevents separate commands from being provided maliciously, e.g. in the case of shell metacharacters. When constructing the command, the developer may use whitespace or other delimiters that are required to separate arguments when the command. However, if an attacker can provide an untrusted input that contains argument-separating delimiters, then the resulting command will have more arguments than intended by the developer. The attacker may then be able to change the behavior of the command. Depending on the functionality supported by the extraneous arguments, this may have security-relevant consequences.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-36069: Python-based dependency management tool avoids OS command injection when generating Git commands but allows injection of optional arguments with input beginning with a dash (CWE-88), potentially allowing for code execution.\n\n- CVE-1999-0113: Canonical Example - \"-froot\" argument is passed on to another program, where the \"-f\" causes execution as user \"root\"\n\n- CVE-2001-0150: Web browser executes Telnet sessions using command line arguments that are specified by the web site, which could allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands.\n\n- CVE-2001-0667: Web browser allows remote attackers to execute commands by spawning Telnet with a log file option on the command line and writing arbitrary code into an executable file which is later executed.\n\n- CVE-2002-0985: Argument injection vulnerability in the mail function for PHP may allow attackers to bypass safe mode restrictions and modify command line arguments to the MTA (e.g. sendmail) possibly executing commands.\n\n- CVE-2003-0907: Help and Support center in windows does not properly validate HCP URLs, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via quotation marks in an \"hcp://\" URL.\n\n- CVE-2004-0121: Mail client does not sufficiently filter parameters of mailto: URLs when using them as arguments to mail executable, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary programs.\n\n- CVE-2004-0473: Web browser doesn't filter \"-\" when invoking various commands, allowing command-line switches to be specified.\n\n- CVE-2004-0480: Mail client allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a URI that uses a UNC network share pathname to provide an alternate configuration file.\n\n- CVE-2004-0489: SSH URI handler for web browser allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or conduct port forwarding via the a command line option.\n\n- CVE-2004-0411: Web browser doesn't filter \"-\" when invoking various commands, allowing command-line switches to be specified.\n\n- CVE-2005-4699: Argument injection vulnerability in TellMe 1.2 and earlier allows remote attackers to modify command line arguments for the Whois program and obtain sensitive information via \"--\" style options in the q_Host parameter.\n\n- CVE-2006-1865: Beagle before 0.2.5 can produce certain insecure command lines to launch external helper applications while indexing, which allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands.

NOTE: it is not clear whether this issue is implementation-specific or a problem in the Microsoft API.\n\n- CVE-2006-2057: Argument injection vulnerability in Mozilla Firefox 1.0.6 allows user-assisted remote attackers to modify command line arguments to an invoked mail client via \" (double quote) characters in a mailto: scheme handler, as demonstrated by launching Microsoft Outlook with an arbitrary filename as an attachment. NOTE: it is not clear whether this issue is implementation-specific or a problem in the Microsoft API.\n\n- CVE-2006-2058: Argument injection vulnerability in Avant Browser 10.1 Build 17 allows user-assisted remote attackers to modify command line arguments to an invoked mail client via \" (double quote) characters in a mailto: scheme handler, as demonstrated by launching Microsoft Outlook with an arbitrary filename as an attachment. NOTE: it is not clear whether this issue is implementation-specific or a problem in the Microsoft API.\n\n- CVE-2006-2312: Argument injection vulnerability in the URI handler in Skype 2.0.*.104 and 2.5.*.0 through 2.5.*.78 for Windows allows remote authorized attackers to download arbitrary files via a URL that contains certain command-line switches.\n\n- CVE-2006-3015: Argument injection vulnerability in WinSCP 3.8.1 build 328 allows remote attackers to upload or download arbitrary files via encoded spaces and double-quote characters in a scp or sftp URI.\n\n- CVE-2006-4692: Argument injection vulnerability in the Windows Object Packager (packager.exe) in Microsoft Windows XP SP1 and SP2 and Server 2003 SP1 and earlier allows remote user-assisted attackers to execute arbitrary commands via a crafted file with a \"/\" (slash) character in the filename of the Command Line property, followed by a valid file extension, which causes the command before the slash to be executed, aka \"Object Packager Dialogue Spoofing Vulnerability.\"\n\n- CVE-2006-6597: Argument injection vulnerability in HyperAccess 8.4 allows user-assisted remote attackers to execute arbitrary vbscript and commands via the /r option in a telnet:// URI, which is configured to use hawin32.exe.\n\n- CVE-2007-0882: Argument injection vulnerability in the telnet daemon (in.telnetd) in Solaris 10 and 11 (SunOS 5.10 and 5.11) misinterprets certain client \"-f\" sequences as valid requests for the login program to skip authentication, which allows remote attackers to log into certain accounts, as demonstrated by the bin account.\n\n- CVE-2001-1246: Language interpreter's mail function accepts another argument that is concatenated to a string used in a dangerous popen() call. Since there is no neutralization of this argument, both OS Command Injection (CWE-78) and Argument Injection (CWE-88) are possible.\n\n- CVE-2019-13475: Argument injection allows execution of arbitrary commands by injecting a \"-exec\" option, which is executed by the command.\n\n- CVE-2016-10033: Argument injection in mail-processing function allows writing unxpected files and executing programs using tecnically-valid email addresses that insert \"-o\" and \"-X\" switches.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-27730: Accellion FTA 9_12_432 and earlier is affected by argument injection via a crafted POST request to an admin endpoint. The fixed version is FTA_9_12_444 and later.\n\n- CVE-2021-3401: Bitcoin Core before 0.19.0 might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code when another application unsafely passes the -platformpluginpath argument to the bitcoin-qt program, as demonstrated by an x-scheme-handler/bitcoin handler for a .desktop file or a web browser. NOTE: the discoverer states \"I believe that this vulnerability cannot actually be exploited.\"\n\n- CVE-2021-29461: Discord Recon Server is a bot that allows one to do one's reconnaissance process from one's Discord. A vulnerability in Discord Recon Server prior to 0.0.3 could be exploited to read internal files from the system and write files into the system resulting in remote code execution. This issue has been fixed in version 0.0.3. As a workaround, one may copy the code from `assets/CommandInjection.py` in the Discord Recon Server code repository and overwrite vulnerable code from one's own Discord Recon Server implementation with code that contains the patch.\n\n- CVE-2021-29472: Composer is a dependency manager for PHP. URLs for Mercurial repositories in the root composer.json and package source download URLs are not sanitized correctly. Specifically crafted URL values allow code to be executed in the HgDriver if hg/Mercurial is installed on the system. The impact to Composer users directly is limited as the composer.json file is typically under their own control and source download URLs can only be supplied by third party Composer repositories they explicitly trust to download and execute source code from, e.g. Composer plugins. The main impact is to services passing user input to Composer, including Packagist.org and Private Packagist. This allowed users to trigger remote code execution. The vulnerability has been patched on Packagist.org and Private Packagist within 12h of receiving the initial vulnerability report and based on a review of logs, to the best of our knowledge, was not abused by anyone. Other services/tools using VcsRepository/VcsDriver or derivatives may also be vulnerable and should upgrade their composer/composer dependency immediately. Versions 1.10.22 and 2.0.13 include patches for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2021-37040: There is a Parameter injection vulnerability in Huawei Smartphone.Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may cause privilege escalation of files after CIFS share mounting.\n\n- CVE-2021-43286: An issue was discovered in ThoughtWorks GoCD before 21.3.0. An attacker with privileges to create a new pipeline on a GoCD server can abuse a command-line injection in the Git URL \"Test Connection\" feature to execute arbitrary code.\n\n- CVE-2021-43809: `Bundler` is a package for managing application dependencies in Ruby. In `bundler` versions before 2.2.33, when working with untrusted and apparently harmless `Gemfile`'s, it is not expected that they lead to execution of external code, unless that's explicit in the ruby code inside the `Gemfile` itself. However, if the `Gemfile` includes `gem` entries that use the `git` option with invalid, but seemingly harmless, values with a leading dash, this can be false. To handle dependencies that come from a Git repository instead of a registry, Bundler uses various commands, such as `git clone`. These commands are being constructed using user input (e.g. the repository URL). When building the commands, Bundler versions before 2.2.33 correctly avoid Command Injection vulnerabilities by passing an array of arguments instead of a command string. However, there is the possibility that a user input starts with a dash (`-`) and is therefore treated as an optional argument instead of a positional one. This can lead to Code Execution because some of the commands have options that can be leveraged to run arbitrary executables. Since this value comes from the `Gemfile` file, it can contain any character, including a leading dash. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker has to craft a directory containing a `Gemfile` file that declares a dependency that is located in a Git repository. This dependency has to have a Git URL in the form of `-u./payload`. This URL will be used to construct a Git clone command but will be interpreted as the upload-pack argument. Then this directory needs to be shared with the victim, who then needs to run a command that evaluates the Gemfile, such as `bundle lock`, inside. This vulnerability can lead to Arbitrary Code Execution, which could potentially lead to the takeover of the system. However, the exploitability is very low, because it requires a lot of user interaction. Bundler 2.2.33 has patched this problem by inserting `--` as an argument before any positional arguments to those Git commands that were affected by this issue. Regardless of whether users can upgrade or not, they should review any untrustred `Gemfile`'s before running any `bundler` commands that may read them, since they can contain arbitrary ruby code.\n\n- CVE-2022-21187: The package libvcs before 0.11.1 are vulnerable to Command Injection via argument injection. When calling the update_repo function (when using hg), the url parameter is passed to the hg clone command. By injecting some hg options it was possible to get arbitrary command execution.\n\n- CVE-2022-21223: The package cocoapods-downloader before 1.6.2 are vulnerable to Command Injection via hg argument injection. When calling the download function (when using hg), the url (and/or revision, tag, branch) is passed to the hg clone command in a way that additional flags can be set. The additional flags can be used to perform a command injection.\n\n- CVE-2022-21235: The package github.com/masterminds/vcs before 1.13.3 are vulnerable to Command Injection via argument injection. When hg is executed, argument strings are passed to hg in a way that additional flags can be set. The additional flags can be used to perform a command injection.\n\n- CVE-2022-24433: The package simple-git before 3.3.0 are vulnerable to Command Injection via argument injection. When calling the .fetch(remote, branch, handlerFn) function, both the remote and branch parameters are passed to the git fetch subcommand. By injecting some git options it was possible to get arbitrary command execution.\n\n- CVE-2022-24440: The package cocoapods-downloader before 1.6.0, from 1.6.2 and before 1.6.3 are vulnerable to Command Injection via git argument injection. When calling the Pod::Downloader.preprocess_options function and using git, both the git and branch parameters are passed to the git ls-remote subcommand in a way that additional flags can be set. The additional flags can be used to perform a command injection.\n\n- CVE-2022-25648: The package git before 1.11.0 are vulnerable to Command Injection via git argument injection. When calling the fetch(remote = 'origin', opts = {}) function, the remote parameter is passed to the git fetch subcommand in a way that additional flags can be set. The additional flags can be used to perform a command injection.\n\n- CVE-2022-25766: The package ungit before 1.5.20 are vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) via argument injection. The issue occurs when calling the /api/fetch endpoint. User controlled values (remote and ref) are passed to the git fetch command. By injecting some git options it was possible to get arbitrary command execution.\n\n- CVE-2022-25865: The package workspace-tools before 0.18.4 are vulnerable to Command Injection via git argument injection. When calling the fetchRemoteBranch(remote: string, remoteBranch: string, cwd: string) function, both the remote and remoteBranch parameters are passed to the git fetch subcommand in a way that additional flags can be set. The additional flags can be used to perform a command injection.\n\n- CVE-2022-25866: The package czproject/git-php before 4.0.3 are vulnerable to Command Injection via git argument injection. When calling the isRemoteUrlReadable($url, array $refs = NULL) function, both the url and refs parameters are passed to the git ls-remote subcommand in a way that additional flags can be set. The additional flags can be used to perform a command injection.\n\n- CVE-2022-25900: All versions of package git-clone are vulnerable to Command Injection due to insecure usage of the --upload-pack feature of git.\n\n- CVE-2022-26532: A argument injection vulnerability in the 'packet-trace' CLI command of Zyxel USG/ZyWALL series firmware versions 4.09 through 4.71, USG FLEX series firmware versions 4.50 through 5.21, ATP series firmware versions 4.32 through 5.21, VPN series firmware versions 4.30 through 5.21, NSG series firmware versions 1.00 through 1.33 Patch 4, NXC2500 firmware version 6.10(AAIG.3) and earlier versions, NAP203 firmware version 6.25(ABFA.7) and earlier versions, NWA50AX firmware version 6.25(ABYW.5) and earlier versions, WAC500 firmware version 6.30(ABVS.2) and earlier versions, and WAX510D firmware version 6.30(ABTF.2) and earlier versions, that could allow a local authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary OS commands by including crafted arguments to the CLI command.\n\n- CVE-2022-36069: Poetry is a dependency manager for Python. When handling dependencies that come from a Git repository instead of a registry, Poetry uses various commands, such as `git clone`. These commands are constructed using user input (e.g. the repository URL). When building the commands, Poetry correctly avoids Command Injection vulnerabilities by passing an array of arguments instead of a command string. However, there is the possibility that a user input starts with a dash (`-`) and is therefore treated as an optional argument instead of a positional one. This can lead to Code Execution because some of the commands have options that can be leveraged to run arbitrary executables. If a developer is exploited, the attacker could steal credentials or persist their access. If the exploit happens on a server, the attackers could use their access to attack other internal systems. Since this vulnerability requires a fair amount of user interaction, it is not as dangerous as a remotely exploitable one. However, it still puts developers at risk when dealing with untrusted files in a way they think is safe, because the exploit still works when the victim tries to make sure nothing can happen, e.g. by vetting any Git or Poetry config files that might be present in the directory. Versions 1.1.9 and 1.2.0b1 contain patches for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-37027: Ahsay AhsayCBS 9.1.4.0 allows an authenticated system user to inject arbitrary Java JVM options. Administrators that can modify the Runtime Options in the web interface can inject Java Runtime Options. These take effect after a restart. For example, an attacker can enable JMX services and consequently achieve remote code execution as the system user.\n\n- CVE-2022-23221: H2 Console before 2.1.210 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a jdbc:h2:mem JDBC URL containing the IGNORE_UNKNOWN_SETTINGS=TRUE;FORBID_CREATION=FALSE;INIT=RUNSCRIPT substring, a different vulnerability than CVE-2021-42392.\n\n- CVE-2022-24066: The package simple-git before 3.5.0 are vulnerable to Command Injection due to an incomplete fix of [CVE-2022-24433](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-SIMPLEGIT-2421199) which only patches against the git fetch attack vector. A similar use of the --upload-pack feature of git is also supported for git clone, which the prior fix didn't cover.\n\n- CVE-2022-24376: All versions of package git-promise are vulnerable to Command Injection due to an inappropriate fix of a prior [vulnerability](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-GITPROMISE-567476) in this package. **Note:** Please note that the vulnerability will not be fixed. The README file was updated with a warning regarding this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-24437: The package git-pull-or-clone before 2.0.2 are vulnerable to Command Injection due to the use of the --upload-pack feature of git which is also supported for git clone. The source includes the use of the secure child process API spawn(). However, the outpath parameter passed to it may be a command-line argument to the git clone command and result in arbitrary command injection.\n\n- CVE-2021-46850: myVesta Control Panel before 0.9.8-26-43 and Vesta Control Panel before 0.9.8-26 are vulnerable to command injection. An authenticated and remote administrative user can execute arbitrary commands via the v_sftp_license parameter when sending HTTP POST requests to the /edit/server endpoint.\n\n- CVE-2022-24953: The Crypt_GPG extension before 1.6.7 for PHP does not prevent additional options in GPG calls, which presents a risk for certain environments and GPG versions.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-77 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-74 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-77 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-77 (ChildOf)",

However, including unexpected data in an HTTP header allows an attacker to specify the entirety of the HTTP message that is rendered by the client HTTP agent (e.g., web browser) or back-end HTTP agent (e.g., web server), whether the message is part of a request or a response. \n\n\nWhen an HTTP request contains unexpected CR and LF characters, the server may respond with an output stream that is interpreted as \"splitting\" the stream into two different HTTP messages instead of one. CR is carriage return, also given by %0d or \\r, and LF is line feed, also given by %0a or \\n.\n\n\nIn addition to CR and LF characters, other valid/RFC compliant special characters and unique character encodings can be utilized, such as HT (horizontal tab, also given by %09 or \\t) and SP (space, also given as + sign or %20).\n\n\nThese types of unvalidated and unexpected data in HTTP message headers allow an attacker to control the second \"split\" message to mount attacks such as server-side request forgery, cross-site scripting, and cache poisoning attacks.\n\n\nHTTP response splitting weaknesses may be present when:\n\n\n  1. Data enters a web application through an untrusted source, most frequently an HTTP request.\n\n  1. The data is included in an HTTP response header sent to a web user without neutralizing malicious characters that can be interpreted as separator characters for headers.\n\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nHTTP Request Splitting\nHTTP Response Splitting\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-93\nCanPrecede -> CWE-79\nChildOf -> CWE-20\nChildOf -> CWE-436\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

It is the lack of verification of these assumptions for user-controlled input that leads to injection problems. Injection problems encompass a wide variety of issues -- all mitigated in very different ways and usually attempted in order to alter the control flow of the process. For this reason, the most effective way to discuss these weaknesses is to note the distinct features that classify them as injection weaknesses. The most important issue to note is that all injection problems share one thing in common -- i.e., they allow for the injection of control plane data into the user-controlled data plane. This means that the execution of the process may be altered by sending code in through legitimate data channels, using no other mechanism. While buffer overflows, and many other flaws, involve the use of some further issue to gain execution, injection problems need only for the data to be parsed.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-707\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n**Comments:** Examine the children and descendants of this entry to find a more precise mapping.\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Theoretical]** Many people treat injection only as an input validation problem (CWE-20) because many people do not distinguish between the consequence/attack (injection) and the protection mechanism that prevents the attack from succeeding. However, input validation is only one potential protection mechanism (output encoding is another), and there is a chaining relationship between improper input validation and the improper enforcement of the structure of messages to other components. Other issues not directly related to input validation, such as race conditions, could similarly impact message structure.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2024-5184:** API service using a large generative AI model allows direct prompt injection to leak hard-coded system prompts or execute other prompts.\n- **CVE-2022-36069:** Python-based dependency management tool avoids OS command injection when generating Git commands but allows injection of optional arguments with input beginning with a dash (CWE-88), potentially allowing for code execution.\n- **CVE-1999-0067:** Canonical example of OS command injection. CGI program does not neutralize \"|\" metacharacter when invoking a phonebook program.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-93: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product uses CRLF (carriage return line feeds) as a special element, e.g. to separate lines or records, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CRLF sequences from inputs.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-74\nCanPrecede -> CWE-117\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.\n\n  1. The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.\n\n  1. During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.\n\n  1. A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.\n\n  1. Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.\n\n  1. This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.\n\nThere are three main kinds of XSS:\n\n  -  **Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent)**  - The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.\n\n  -  **Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent)**  - The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs. \n\n  -  **Type 0: DOM-Based XSS**  - In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible. \n\nOnce the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"\n\nIn many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nXSS: A common abbreviation for Cross-Site Scripting.\nHTML Injection: Used as a synonym of stored (Type 2) XSS.\nCSS: In the early years after initial discovery of XSS, \"CSS\" was a commonly-used acronym. However, this would cause confusion with \"Cascading Style Sheets,\" so usage of this acronym has declined significantly.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-74\nChildOf -> CWE-74\nCanPrecede -> CWE-494\nPeerOf -> CWE-352\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** \n\nThere can be a close relationship between XSS and CSRF (CWE-352). An attacker might use CSRF in order to trick the victim into submitting requests to the server in which the requests contain an XSS payload. A well-known example of this was the Samy worm on MySpace [REF-956]. The worm used XSS to insert malicious HTML sequences into a user's profile and add the attacker as a MySpace friend. MySpace friends of that victim would then execute the payload to modify their own profiles, causing the worm to propagate exponentially. Since the victims did not intentionally insert the malicious script themselves, CSRF was a root cause.\n\n\n**[Applicable Platform]** \n\nXSS flaws are very common in web applications, since they require a great deal of developer discipline to avoid them.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-25926:** Python Library Manager did not sufficiently neutralize a user-supplied search term, allowing reflected XSS.\n- **CVE-2021-25963:** Python-based e-commerce platform did not escape returned content on error pages, allowing for reflected Cross-Site Scripting attacks.\n- **CVE-2021-1879:** Universal XSS in mobile operating system, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n### Extended Description\nMost languages and protocols have their own special elements such as characters and reserved words. These special elements can carry control implications. If product does not prevent external control or influence over the inclusion of such special elements, the control flow of the program may be altered from what was intended. For example, both Unix and Windows interpret the symbol < (\"less than\") as meaning \"read input from a file\".\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-707\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This weakness can be related to interpretation conflicts or interaction errors in intermediaries (such as proxies or application firewalls) when the intermediary's model of an endpoint does not account for protocol-specific special elements.\n\n**[Relationship]** See this entry's children for different types of special elements that have been observed at one point or another. However, it can be difficult to find suitable CVE examples. In an attempt to be complete, CWE includes some types that do not have any associated observed example.\n\n**[Research Gap]** This weakness is probably under-studied for proprietary or custom formats. It is likely that these issues are fairly common in applications that use their own custom format for configuration files, logs, meta-data, messaging, etc. They would only be found by accident or with a focused effort based on an understanding of the format.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2001-0677:** Read arbitrary files from mail client by providing a special MIME header that is internally used to store pathnames for attachments.\n- **CVE-2000-0703:** Setuid program does not cleanse special escape sequence before sending data to a mail program, causing the mail program to process those sequences.\n- **CVE-2003-0020:** Multi-channel issue. Terminal escape sequences not filtered from log files.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-96: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Statically Saved Code ('Static Code Injection')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes code syntax before inserting the input into an executable resource, such as a library, configuration file, or template.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-94\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** \"HTML injection\" (see CWE-79: XSS) could be thought of as an example of this, but the code is injected and executed on the client side, not the server side. Server-Side Includes (SSI) are an example of direct static code injection.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2002-0495:** Perl code directly injected into CGI library file from parameters to another CGI program.\n- **CVE-2005-1876:** Direct PHP code injection into supporting template file.\n- **CVE-2005-1894:** Direct code injection into PHP script that can be accessed by attacker.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-471: Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID)\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not properly protect an assumed-immutable element from being modified by an attacker.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis occurs when a particular input is critical enough to the functioning of the application that it should not be modifiable at all, but it is. Certain resources are often assumed to be immutable when they are not, such as hidden form fields in web applications, cookies, and reverse DNS lookups.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-664\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** MAID issues can be primary to many other weaknesses, and they are a major factor in languages that provide easy access to internal program constructs, such as PHP's register_globals and similar features. However, MAID issues can also be resultant from weaknesses that modify internal state; for example, a program might validate some data and store it in memory, but a buffer overflow could overwrite that validated data, leading to a change in program logic.\n\n**[Theoretical]** There are many examples where the MUTABILITY property is a major factor in a vulnerability.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2002-1757:** Relies on $PHP_SELF variable for authentication.\n- **CVE-2005-1905:** Gain privileges by modifying assumed-immutable code addresses that are accessed by a driver.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component. Without sufficient removal or quoting of SQL syntax in user-controllable inputs, the generated SQL query can cause those inputs to be interpreted as SQL instead of ordinary user data.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nSQL injection: a common attack-oriented phrase\nSQLi: a common abbreviation for \"SQL injection\"\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-943\nChildOf -> CWE-74\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** SQL injection can be resultant from special character mismanagement, MAID, or denylist/allowlist problems. It can be primary to authentication errors.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2023-32530:** SQL injection in security product dashboard using crafted certificate fields\n- **CVE-2021-42258:** SQL injection in time and billing software, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2021-27101:** SQL injection in file-transfer system via a crafted Host header, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-200\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-209\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-202\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Other]** Sensitive information could include data that is sensitive in and of itself (such as credentials or private messages), or otherwise useful in the further exploitation of the system (such as internal file system structure).\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-0708:** Collaboration platform does not clear team emails in a response, allowing leak of email addresses\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-1336: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product uses a template engine to insert or process externally-influenced input, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements or syntax that can be interpreted as template expressions or other code directives when processed by the engine.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nMany web applications use template engines that allow developers to insert externally-influenced values into free text or messages in order to generate a full web page, document, message, etc. Such engines include Twig, Jinja2, Pug, Java Server Pages, FreeMarker, Velocity, ColdFusion, Smarty, and many others - including PHP itself. Some CMS (Content Management Systems) also use templates.\n\n\nTemplate engines often have their own custom command or expression language. If an attacker can influence input into a template before it is processed, then the attacker can invoke arbitrary expressions, i.e. perform injection attacks. For example, in some template languages, an attacker could inject the expression \"{{7*7}}\" and determine if the output returns \"49\" instead. The syntax varies depending on the language.\n\n\nIn some cases, XSS-style attacks can work, which can obscure the root cause if the developer does not closely investigate the root cause of the error.\n\n\nTemplate engines can be used on the server or client, so both \"sides\" could be affected by injection. The mechanisms of attack or the affected technologies might be different, but the mistake is fundamentally the same.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nServer-Side Template Injection / SSTI: This term is used for injection into template engines being used by a server.\nClient-Side Template Injection / CSTI: This term is used for injection into template engines being used by a client.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-94\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** Since expression languages are often used in templating languages, there may be some overlap with CWE-917 (Expression Language Injection). XSS (CWE-79) is also co-located with template injection.\n\n**[Maintenance]** The interrelationships and differences between CWE-917 and CWE-1336 need to be further clarified.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2024-34359:** Chain: Python bindings for LLM library do not use a sandboxed environment when parsing a template and constructing a prompt, allowing jinja2 Server Side Template Injection and code execution - one variant of a \"prompt injection\" attack.\n- **CVE-2017-16783:** server-side template injection in content management server\n- **CVE-2020-9437:** authentication / identity management product has client-side template injection\n\n",

However, including unexpected data in an HTTP header allows an attacker to specify the entirety of the HTTP message that is rendered by the client HTTP agent (e.g., web browser) or back-end HTTP agent (e.g., web server), whether the message is part of a request or a response. \n\n\nWhen an HTTP request contains unexpected CR and LF characters, the server may respond with an output stream that is interpreted as \"splitting\" the stream into two different HTTP messages instead of one. CR is carriage return, also given by %0d or \\r, and LF is line feed, also given by %0a or \\n.\n\n\nIn addition to CR and LF characters, other valid/RFC compliant special characters and unique character encodings can be utilized, such as HT (horizontal tab, also given by %09 or \\t) and SP (space, also given as + sign or %20).\n\n\nThese types of unvalidated and unexpected data in HTTP message headers allow an attacker to control the second \"split\" message to mount attacks such as server-side request forgery, cross-site scripting, and cache poisoning attacks.\n\n\nHTTP response splitting weaknesses may be present when:\n\n\n  1. Data enters a web application through an untrusted source, most frequently an HTTP request.\n\n  1. The data is included in an HTTP response header sent to a web user without neutralizing malicious characters that can be interpreted as separator characters for headers.\n\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-15811: Chain: Proxy uses a substring search instead of parsing the Transfer-Encoding header (CWE-697), allowing request splitting (CWE-113) and cache poisoning\n\n- CVE-2021-41084: Scala-based HTTP interface allows request splitting and response splitting through header names, header values, status reasons, and URIs\n\n- CVE-2018-12116: Javascript-based framework allows request splitting through a path option of an HTTP request\n\n- CVE-2004-2146: Application accepts CRLF in an object ID, allowing HTTP response splitting.\n\n- CVE-2004-1656: Shopping cart allows HTTP response splitting to perform HTML injection via CRLF in a parameter for a url\n\n- CVE-2005-2060: Bulletin board allows response splitting via CRLF in parameter.\n\n- CVE-2004-2512: Response splitting via CRLF in PHPSESSID.\n\n- CVE-2005-1951: e-commerce app allows HTTP response splitting using CRLF in object id parameters\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-0268: An Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Response Splitting') weakness in J-web of Juniper Networks Junos OS leads to buffer overflows, segment faults, or other impacts, which allows an attacker to modify the integrity of the device and exfiltration information from the device without authentication. The weakness can be exploited to facilitate cross-site scripting (XSS), cookie manipulation (modifying session cookies, stealing cookies) and more. This weakness can also be exploited by directing a user to a seemingly legitimate link from the affected site. The attacker requires no special access or permissions to the device to carry out such attacks. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS: 18.1 versions prior to 18.1R3-S11; 18.2 versions prior to 18.2R3-S5; 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R2-S4, 18.3R3-S3; 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R2-S5, 18.4R3-S3; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R2-S2, 19.1R3-S2; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S5, 19.2R2; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R3; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R1-S3, 19.4R2, 19.4R3; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R1-S2, 20.1R2. This issue does not affect Juniper Networks Junos OS versions prior to 18.1R1.\n\n- CVE-2021-28979: SafeNet KeySecure Management Console 8.12.0 is vulnerable to HTTP response splitting attacks. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using specially-crafted URL to cause the server to return a split response, once the URL is clicked.\n\n- CVE-2021-41084: http4s is an open source scala interface for HTTP. In affected versions http4s is vulnerable to response-splitting or request-splitting attacks when untrusted user input is used to create any of the following fields: Header names (`Header.name`\u00e5), Header values (`Header.value`), Status reason phrases (`Status.reason`), URI paths (`Uri.Path`), URI authority registered names (`URI.RegName`) (through 0.21). This issue has been resolved in versions 0.21.30, 0.22.5, 0.23.4, and 1.0.0-M27 perform the following. As a matter of practice http4s services and client applications should sanitize any user input in the aforementioned fields before returning a request or response to the backend. The carriage return, newline, and null characters are the most threatening.\n\n- CVE-2021-45818: SAFARI Montage 8.7.32 is affected by a CRLF injection vulnerability which can lead to HTTP response splitting.\n\n- CVE-2021-33621: The cgi gem before 0.1.0.2, 0.2.x before 0.2.2, and 0.3.x before 0.3.5 for Ruby allows HTTP response splitting. This is relevant to applications that use untrusted user input either to generate an HTTP response or to create a CGI::Cookie object.\n\n- CVE-2021-40336: A vulnerability exists in the http web interface where the web interface does not validate data in an HTTP header. This causes a possible HTTP response splitting, which if exploited could lead an attacker to channel down harmful code into the user\u2019s web browser, such as to steal the session cookies. Thus, an attacker who successfully makes an MSM user who has already established a session to MSM web interface clicks a forged link to the MSM web interface, e.g., the link is sent per E-Mail, could trick the user into downloading malicious software onto his computer. This issue affects: Hitachi Energy MSM V2.2 and prior versions.\n\n- CVE-2021-41437: An HTTP response splitting attack in web application in ASUS RT-AX88U before v3.0.0.4.388.20558 allows an attacker to craft a specific URL that if an authenticated victim visits it, the URL will give access to the cloud storage of the attacker.\n\n- CVE-2022-20772: A vulnerability in Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA) and Cisco Secure Email and Web Manager could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct an HTTP response splitting attack. This vulnerability is due to the failure of the application or its environment to properly sanitize input values. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious HTTP headers, controlling the response body, or splitting the response into multiple responses.\n\n- CVE-2022-35507: A response-header CRLF injection vulnerability in the Proxmox Virtual Environment (PVE) and Proxmox Mail Gateway (PMG) web interface allows a remote attacker to set cookies for a victim's browser that are longer than the server expects, causing a client-side DoS. This affects Chromium-based browsers because they allow injection of response headers with %0d. This is fixed in pve-http-server 4.1-3.\n\n- CVE-2022-37240: MDaemon Technologies SecurityGateway for Email Servers 8.5.2 is vulnerable to HTTP Response splitting via the format parameter.\n\n- CVE-2022-37242: MDaemon Technologies SecurityGateway for Email Servers 8.5.2, is vulnerable to HTTP Response splitting via the data parameter.\n\n- CVE-2022-37953: An HTTP response splitting vulnerability exists in the AM Gateway Challenge-Response dialog of WorkstationST (<v07.09.15) and could allow an attacker to compromise a victim's browser/session. WorkstationST is only deployed in specific, controlled environments rendering attack complexity significantly higher than if the attack were conducted on the software in isolation. WorkstationST v07.09.15 can be found in ControlST v07.09.07 SP8 and greater.\n\n- CVE-2022-42471: An improper neutralization of CRLF sequences in HTTP headers ('HTTP Response Splitting') vulnerability [CWE-113] In FortiWeb version 7.0.0 through 7.0.2, FortiWeb version 6.4.0 through 6.4.2, FortiWeb version 6.3.6 through 6.3.20 may allow an authenticated and remote attacker to inject arbitrary headers.\n\n- CVE-2022-42472: A improper neutralization of crlf sequences in http headers ('http response splitting') in Fortinet FortiOS versions 7.2.0 through 7.2.2, 7.0.0 through 7.0.8, 6.4.0 through 6.4.11, 6.2.0 through 6.2.12, 6.0.0 through 6.0.16, FortiProxy 7.2.0 through 7.2.1, 7.0.0 through 7.0.7, 2.0.0 through 2.0.10, 1.2.0 through 1.2.13, 1.1.0 through 1.1.6 may allow an authenticated and remote attacker to perform an HTTP request splitting attack which gives attackers control of the remaining headers and body of the response.\n\n- CVE-2022-47052: The web interface of the 'Nighthawk R6220 AC1200 Smart Wi-Fi Router' is vulnerable to a CRLF Injection attack that can be leveraged to perform Reflected XSS and HTML Injection. A malicious unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability using a specially crafted URL. This affects firmware versions: V1.1.0.112_1.0.1, V1.1.0.114_1.0.1.\n\n- CVE-2021-37499: CRLF vulnerability in Reprise License Manager (RLM) web interface through 14.2BL4 in the password parameter in View License Result function, that allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary HTTP headers.\n\n- CVE-2022-32453: HTTP header injection vulnerability in Cybozu Office 10.0.0 to 10.8.5 may allow a remote attacker to obtain and/or alter the data of the product via unspecified vectors.\n\n- CVE-2022-3918: A program using FoundationNetworking in swift-corelibs-foundation is potentially vulnerable to CRLF ( ) injection in URLRequest headers. In this vulnerability, a client can insert one or several CRLF sequences into a URLRequest header value. When that request is sent via URLSession to an HTTP server, the server may interpret the content after the CRLF as extra headers, or even a second request. For example, consider a URLRequest to http://example.com/ with the GET method. Suppose we set the URLRequest header \"Foo\" to the value \"Bar Extra-Header: Added GET /other HTTP/1.1\". When this request is sent, it will appear to the server as two requests: GET / HTTP/1.1 Foo: Bar Extra-Header: Added GET /other HTTP/1.1 In this manner, the client is able to inject extra headers and craft an entirely new request to a separate path, despite only making one API call in URLSession. If a developer has total control over the request and its headers, this vulnerability may not pose a threat. However, this vulnerability escalates if un-sanitized user input is placed in header values. If so, a malicious user could inject new headers or requests to an intermediary or backend server. Developers should be especially careful to sanitize user input in this case, or upgrade their version of swift-corelibs-foundation to include the patch below.\n\n- CVE-2022-4188: Insufficient validation of untrusted input in CORS in Google Chrome on Android prior to 108.0.5359.71 allowed a remote attacker to bypass same origin policy via a crafted HTML page.

It is the lack of verification of these assumptions for user-controlled input that leads to injection problems. Injection problems encompass a wide variety of issues -- all mitigated in very different ways and usually attempted in order to alter the control flow of the process. For this reason, the most effective way to discuss these weaknesses is to note the distinct features that classify them as injection weaknesses. The most important issue to note is that all injection problems share one thing in common -- i.e., they allow for the injection of control plane data into the user-controlled data plane. This means that the execution of the process may be altered by sending code in through legitimate data channels, using no other mechanism. While buffer overflows, and many other flaws, involve the use of some further issue to gain execution, injection problems need only for the data to be parsed.\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2024-5184: API service using a large generative AI model allows direct prompt injection to leak hard-coded system prompts or execute other prompts.\n\n- CVE-2022-36069: Python-based dependency management tool avoids OS command injection when generating Git commands but allows injection of optional arguments with input beginning with a dash (CWE-88), potentially allowing for code execution.\n\n- CVE-1999-0067: Canonical example of OS command injection.

However, this would cause confusion with \"Cascading Style Sheets,\" so usage of this acronym has declined significantly.\n\nDescription:\n\nThe product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.\n\nExtended Details:\n\n\n\nCross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:\n\n\n  1. Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.\n\n  1. The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.\n\n  1. During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.\n\n  1. A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.\n\n  1. Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.\n\n  1. This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.\n\nThere are three main kinds of XSS:\n\n  -  **Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent)**  - The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.\n\n  -  **Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent)**  - The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs. \n\n  -  **Type 0: DOM-Based XSS**  - In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible. \n\nOnce the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"\n\nIn many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-25926: Python Library Manager did not sufficiently neutralize a user-supplied search term, allowing reflected XSS.\n\n- CVE-2021-25963: Python-based e-commerce platform did not escape returned content on error pages, allowing for reflected Cross-Site Scripting attacks.\n\n- CVE-2021-1879: Universal XSS in mobile operating system, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2020-3580: Chain: improper input validation (CWE-20) in firewall product leads to XSS (CWE-79), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2014-8958: Admin GUI allows XSS through cookie.\n\n- CVE-2017-9764: Web stats program allows XSS through crafted HTTP header.\n\n- CVE-2014-5198: Web log analysis product allows XSS through crafted HTTP Referer header.\n\n- CVE-2008-5080: Chain: protection mechanism failure allows XSS\n\n- CVE-2006-4308: Chain: incomplete denylist (CWE-184) only checks \"javascript:\" tag, allowing XSS (CWE-79) using other tags\n\n- CVE-2007-5727: Chain: incomplete denylist (CWE-184) only removes SCRIPT tags, enabling XSS (CWE-79)\n\n- CVE-2008-5770: Reflected XSS using the PATH_INFO in a URL\n\n- CVE-2008-4730: Reflected XSS not properly handled when generating an error message\n\n- CVE-2008-5734: Reflected XSS sent through email message.\n\n- CVE-2008-0971: Stored XSS in a security product.\n\n- CVE-2008-5249: Stored XSS using a wiki page.\n\n- CVE-2006-3568: Stored XSS in a guestbook application.\n\n- CVE-2006-3211: Stored XSS in a guestbook application using a javascript: URI in a bbcode img tag.\n\n- CVE-2006-3295: Chain: library file is not protected against a direct request (CWE-425), leading to reflected XSS (CWE-79).\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-7050: Codologic Codoforum through 4.8.4 allows a DOM-based XSS. While creating a new topic as a normal user, it is possible to add a poll that is automatically loaded in the DOM once the thread/topic is opened. Because session cookies lack the HttpOnly flag, it is possible to steal authentication cookies and take over accounts.\n\n- CVE-2020-7051: Codologic Codoforum through 4.8.4 allows stored XSS in the login area. This is relevant in conjunction with CVE-2020-5842 because session cookies lack the HttpOnly flag. The impact is account takeover.\n\n- CVE-2021-1543: Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business 220 Series Smart Switches could allow an attacker to do the following: Hijack a user session Execute arbitrary commands as a root user on the underlying operating system Conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack Conduct an HTML injection attack For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2021-21260: Online Invoicing System (OIS) is open source software which is a lean invoicing system for small businesses, consultants and freelancers created using AppGini. In OIS version 4.0 there is a stored XSS which can enables an attacker takeover of the admin account through a payload that extracts a csrf token and sends a request to change password. It has been found that Item description is reflected without sanitization in app/items_view.php which enables the malicious scenario.\n\n- CVE-2021-21283: Flarum is an open source discussion platform for websites. The \"Flarum Sticky\" extension versions 0.1.0-beta.14 and 0.1.0-beta.15 has a cross-site scripting vulnerability. A change in release beta 14 of the Sticky extension caused the plain text content of the first post of a pinned discussion to be injected as HTML on the discussion list. The issue was discovered following an internal audit. Any HTML would be injected through the m.trust() helper. This resulted in an HTML injection where <script> tags would not be executed. However it was possible to run javascript from other HTML attributes, enabling a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack to be performed. Since the exploit only happens with the first post of a pinned discussion, an attacker would need the ability to pin their own discussion, or be able to edit a discussion that was previously pinned. On forums where all pinned posts are authored by your staff, you can be relatively certain the vulnerability has not been exploited. Forums where some user-created discussions were pinned can look at the first post edit date to find whether the vulnerability might have been exploited. Because Flarum doesn't store the post content history, you cannot be certain if a malicious edit was reverted. The fix will be available in version v0.1.0-beta.16 with Flarum beta 16. The fix has already been back-ported to Flarum beta 15 as version v0.1.0-beta.15.1 of the Sticky extension. Forum administrators can disable the Sticky extension until they are able to apply the update. The vulnerability cannot be exploited while the extension is disabled.\n\n- CVE-2021-21332: Synapse is a Matrix reference homeserver written in python (pypi package matrix-synapse). Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and VoIP. In Synapse before version 1.27.0, the password reset endpoint served via Synapse was vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. The impact depends on the configuration of the domain that Synapse is deployed on, but may allow access to cookies and other browser data, CSRF vulnerabilities, and access to other resources served on the same domain or parent domains. This is fixed in version 1.27.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-22223: Client-Side code injection through Feature Flag name in GitLab CE/EE starting with 11.9 allows a specially crafted feature flag name to PUT requests on behalf of other users via clicking on a link\n\n- CVE-2021-22722: A CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Stored Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability exists in EVlink City (EVC1S22P4 / EVC1S7P4 all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1), EVlink Parking (EVW2 / EVF2 / EV.2 all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1), and EVlink Smart Wallbox (EVB1A all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1 ) that could cause code injection when importing a CSV file or changing station parameters.\n\n- CVE-2021-22723: A CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation (Cross-siteScripting) through Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in EVlink City (EVC1S22P4 / EVC1S7P4 all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1), EVlink Parking (EVW2 / EVF2 / EV.2 all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1), and EVlink Smart Wallbox (EVB1A all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1 ) that could allow an attacker to impersonate the user who manages the charging station or carry out actions on their behalf when crafted malicious parameters are submitted to the charging station web server.\n\n- CVE-2021-24301: The Hotjar Connecticator WordPress plugin through 1.1.1 is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the 'hotjar script' textarea. The request did include a CSRF nonce that was properly verified by the server and this vulnerability could only be exploited by administrator users.\n\n- CVE-2021-24891: The Elementor Website Builder WordPress plugin before 3.4.8 does not sanitise or escape user input appended to the DOM via a malicious hash, resulting in a DOM Cross-Site Scripting issue.\n\n- CVE-2021-25955: In \u201cDolibarr ERP CRM\u201d, WYSIWYG Editor module, v2.8.1 to v13.0.2 are affected by a stored XSS vulnerability that allows low privileged application users to store malicious scripts in the \u201cPrivate Note\u201d field at \u201c/adherents/note.php?id=1\u201d endpoint. These scripts are executed in a victim\u2019s browser when they open the page containing the vulnerable field. In the worst case, the victim who inadvertently triggers the attack is a highly privileged administrator. The injected scripts can extract the Session ID, which can lead to full Account takeover of the admin and due to other vulnerability (Improper Access Control on Private notes) a low privileged user can update the private notes which could lead to privilege escalation.\n\n- CVE-2021-26929: An XSS issue was discovered in Horde Groupware Webmail Edition through 5.2.22 (where the Horde_Text_Filter library before 2.3.7 is used). The attacker can send a plain text e-mail message, with JavaScript encoded as a link or email that is mishandled by preProcess in Text2html.php, because bespoke use of \\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00 and \\\\x01\\\\x01\\\\x01 interferes with XSS defenses.\n\n- CVE-2021-29208: A remote dom xss, crlf injection vulnerability was discovered in HPE Integrated Lights-Out 4 (iLO 4); HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen9; HPE Integrated Lights-Out 5 (iLO 5) for HPE Gen10 Servers; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10; HPE SimpliVity 2600; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10 G; HPE SimpliVity 325; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10 H version(s): Prior to version 2.78.\n\n- CVE-2021-29209: A remote dom xss, crlf injection vulnerability was discovered in HPE Integrated Lights-Out 4 (iLO 4); HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen9; HPE Integrated Lights-Out 5 (iLO 5) for HPE Gen10 Servers; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10; HPE SimpliVity 2600; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10 G; HPE SimpliVity 325; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10 H version(s): Prior to version 2.78.\n\n- CVE-2021-29210: A remote dom xss, crlf injection vulnerability was discovered in HPE Integrated Lights-Out 4 (iLO 4); HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen9; HPE Integrated Lights-Out 5 (iLO 5) for HPE Gen10 Servers; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10; HPE SimpliVity 2600; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10 G; HPE SimpliVity 325; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10 H version(s): Prior to version 2.78.\n\n- CVE-2021-29459: XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. It is possible to persistently inject scripts in XWiki versions prior to 12.6.3 and 12.8. Unregistred users can fill simple text fields. Registered users can fill in their personal information and (if they have edit rights) fill the values of static lists using App Within Minutes. There is no easy workaround except upgrading XWiki. The vulnerability has been patched on XWiki 12.8 and 12.6.3.\n\n- CVE-2021-32772: Poddycast is a podcast app made with Electron. Prior to version 0.8.1, an attacker can create a podcast or episode with malicious characters and execute commands on the client machine. The application does not clean the HTML characters of the podcast information obtained from the Feed, which allows the injection of HTML and JS code (cross-site scripting). Being an application made in electron, cross-site scripting can be scaled to remote code execution, making it possible to execute commands on the machine where the application is running. The vulnerability is patched in Poddycast version 0.8.1.\n\n- CVE-2021-34656: The 2Way VideoCalls and Random Chat - HTML5 Webcam Videochat WordPress plugin is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the `vws_notice` function found in the ~/inc/requirements.php file which allows attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts, in versions up to and including 5.2.7.\n\n- CVE-2021-34763: Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software could allow an attacker to execute a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack or an open redirect attack. For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2021-34821: Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in AAT Novus Management System through 1.51.2. The WebUI has wrong HTTP 404 error handling implemented. A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to exploit the issue by sending malicious HTTP requests to non-existing URIs. The value of the URL path filename is copied into the HTML document as plain text tags.\n\n- CVE-2021-3529: A flaw was found in noobaa-core in versions before 5.7.0. This flaw results in the name of an arbitrarily URL being copied into an HTML document as plain text between tags, including potentially a payload script. The input was echoed unmodified in the application response, resulting in arbitrary JavaScript being injected into an application's response. The highest threat to the system is for confidentiality, availability, and integrity.\n\n- CVE-2021-39186: GlobalNewFiles is a MediaWiki extension maintained by Miraheze. Prior to commit number cee254e1b158cdb0ddbea716b1d3edc31fa4fb5d, the username column of the GlobalNewFiles special page is vulnerable to a stored XSS. Commit number cee254e1b158cdb0ddbea716b1d3edc31fa4fb5d contains a patch. As a workaround, one may disallow <,> (or other characters required to insert html/js) from being used in account names so an XSS is not possible.\n\n- CVE-2021-37541: In JetBrains Hub before 2021.1.13402, HTML injection in the password reset email was possible.\n\n- CVE-2021-34419: In the Zoom Client for Meetings for Ubuntu Linux before version 5.1.0, there is an HTML injection flaw when sending a remote control request to a user in the process of in-meeting screen sharing. This could allow meeting participants to be targeted for social engineering attacks.\n\n- CVE-2021-30057: A stored HTML injection vulnerability exists in Knowage Suite version 7.1. An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML in \"/restful-services/2.0/analyticalDrivers\" via the 'LABEL' and 'NAME' parameters.\n\n- CVE-2021-22232: HTML injection was possible via the full name field before versions 13.11.6, 13.12.6, and 14.0.2 in GitLab CE\n\n- CVE-2020-23050: TAO Open Source Assessment Platform v3.3.0 RC02 was discovered to contain a HTML injection vulnerability in the userFirstName parameter of the user account input field. This vulnerability allows attackers to execute phishing attacks, external redirects, and arbitrary code.\n\n- CVE-2021-39348: The LearnPress WordPress plugin is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting due to insufficient escaping on the $custom_profile parameter found in the ~/inc/admin/views/backend-user-profile.php file which allowed attackers with administrative user access to inject arbitrary web scripts, in versions up to and including 4.1.3.1. This affects multi-site installations where unfiltered_html is disabled for administrators, and sites where unfiltered_html is disabled. Please note that this is seperate from CVE-2021-24702.\n\n- CVE-2021-21333: Synapse is a Matrix reference homeserver written in python (pypi package matrix-synapse). Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and VoIP. In Synapse before version 1.27.0, the notification emails sent for notifications for missed messages or for an expiring account are subject to HTML injection. In the case of the notification for missed messages, this could allow an attacker to insert forged content into the email. The account expiry feature is not enabled by default and the HTML injection is not controllable by an attacker. This is fixed in version 1.27.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-42663: An HTML injection vulnerability exists in Sourcecodester Online Event Booking and Reservation System in PHP/MySQL via the msg parameter to /event-management/index.php. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability in order to change the visibility of the website. Once the target user clicks on a given link he will display the content of the HTML code of the attacker's choice.\n\n- CVE-2021-41248: GraphiQL is the reference implementation of this monorepo, GraphQL IDE, an official project under the GraphQL Foundation. All versions of graphiql older than graphiql@1.4.7 are vulnerable to compromised HTTP schema introspection responses or schema prop values with malicious GraphQL type names, exposing a dynamic XSS attack surface that can allow code injection on operation autocomplete. In order for the attack to take place, the user must load a vulnerable schema in graphiql. There are a number of ways that can occur. By default, the schema URL is not attacker-controllable in graphiql or in its suggested implementations or examples, leaving only very complex attack vectors. If a custom implementation of graphiql's fetcher allows the schema URL to be set dynamically, such as a URL query parameter like ?endpoint= in graphql-playground, or a database provided value, then this custom graphiql implementation is vulnerable to phishing attacks, and thus much more readily available, low or no privelege level xss attacks. The URLs could look like any generic looking graphql schema URL. It should be noted that desktop clients such as Altair, Insomnia, Postwoman, do not appear to be impacted by this. This vulnerability does not impact codemirror-graphql, monaco-graphql or other dependents, as it exists in onHasCompletion.ts in graphiql. It does impact all forks of graphiql, and every released version of graphiql.\n\n- CVE-2021-41249: GraphQL Playground is a GraphQL IDE for development of graphQL focused applications. All versions of graphql-playground-react older than graphql-playground-react@1.7.28 are vulnerable to compromised HTTP schema introspection responses or schema prop values with malicious GraphQL type names, exposing a dynamic XSS attack surface that can allow code injection on operation autocomplete. In order for the attack to take place, the user must load a malicious schema in graphql-playground. There are several ways this can occur, including by specifying the URL to a malicious schema in the endpoint query parameter. If a user clicks on a link to a GraphQL Playground installation that specifies a malicious server, arbitrary JavaScript can run in the user's browser, which can be used to exfiltrate user credentials or other harmful goals. If you are using graphql-playground-react directly in your client app, upgrade to version 1.7.28 or later.\n\n- CVE-2021-41825: Verint Workforce Optimization (WFO) 15.2.5.1033 allows HTML injection via the /wfo/control/signin username parameter.\n\n- CVE-2021-42564: An open redirect through HTML injection in confidential messages in Cryptshare before 5.1.0 allows remote attackers (with permission to provide confidential messages via Cryptshare) to redirect targeted victims to any URL via the '<meta http-equiv=\"refresh\"' substring in the editor parameter.\n\n- CVE-2021-43683: pictshare v1.5 is affected by a Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in api/info.php. The exit function will terminate the script and print the message which has $_REQUEST['hash'].\n\n- CVE-2021-31682: The login portal for the Automated Logic WebCTRL/WebCTRL OEM web application contains a vulnerability that allows for reflected XSS attacks due to the operatorlocale GET parameter not being sanitized. This issue impacts versions 6.5 and below. This issue works by passing in a basic XSS payload to a vulnerable GET parameter that is reflected in the output without sanitization.\n\n- CVE-2021-21313: GLPI is open source software which stands for Gestionnaire Libre de Parc Informatique and it is a Free Asset and IT Management Software package. In GLPI before verison 9.5.4, there is a vulnerability in the /ajax/common.tabs.php endpoint, indeed, at least two parameters _target and id are not properly sanitized.

Versions prior to 2.31.1 contain a low impact and limited cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The code for XSS payload is always visible, but an attacker can use other techniques to hide the code the victim sees. If the application uses the `execHash` option and executes code from URL, the attacker can use this URL to execute their code. The scope is limited because the javascript attribute used is added to span tag, so no automatic execution like with `onerror` on images is possible. This issue is fixed in version 2.31.1. As a workaround, the user can use formatting that wrap whole user input and its no op. The code for this workaround is available in the GitHub Security Advisory. The fix will only work when user of the library is not using different formatters (e.g. to highlight code in different way).\n\n- CVE-2021-43961: Sonatype Nexus Repository Manager 3.36.0 allows HTML Injection.\n\n- CVE-2021-44082: textpattern 4.8.7 is vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS) via /textpattern/index.php,Body.

Argo CD starting with 2.3.0 and prior to 2.3.6 and 2.4.5 is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting (XSS) bug which could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript in the `/auth/callback` page in a victim's browser. This vulnerability only affects Argo CD instances which have single sign on (SSO) enabled. The exploit also assumes the attacker has 1) access to the API server's encryption key, 2) a method to add a cookie to the victim's browser, and 3) the ability to convince the victim to visit a malicious `/auth/callback` link. The vulnerability is classified as low severity because access to the API server's encryption key already grants a high level of access. Exploiting the XSS would allow the attacker to impersonate the victim, but would not grant any privileges which the attacker could not otherwise gain using the encryption key. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in the following Argo CD versions 2.4.5 and 2.3.6. There is currently no known workaround.\n\n- CVE-2022-3242: Code Injection in GitHub repository microweber/microweber prior to 1.3.2.\n\n- CVE-2022-32763: A cross-site scripting (xss) sanitization vulnerability bypass exists in the SanitizeHtml functionality of Lansweeper lansweeper 10.1.1.0.

The victim's encrypted password can be stolen and most likely be decrypted.\n\n- CVE-2022-45004: Gophish through 0.12.1 was discovered to contain a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability via a crafted landing page.\n\n- CVE-2022-45411: Cross-Site Tracing occurs when a server will echo a request back via the Trace method, allowing an XSS attack to access to authorization headers and cookies inaccessible to JavaScript (such as cookies protected by HTTPOnly). To mitigate this attack, browsers placed limits on <code>fetch()</code> and XMLHttpRequest; however some webservers have implemented non-standard headers such as <code>X-Http-Method-Override</code> that override the HTTP method, and made this attack possible again. Thunderbird has applied the same mitigations to the use of this and similar headers. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 102.5, Thunderbird < 102.5, and Firefox < 107.\n\n- CVE-2022-39207: Onedev is an open source, self-hosted Git Server with CI/CD and Kanban. During CI/CD builds, it is possible to save build artifacts for later retrieval. They can be accessed through OneDev's web UI after the successful run of a build. These artifact files are served by the webserver in the same context as the UI without any further restrictions. This leads to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) when a user creates a build artifact that contains HTML. When accessing the artifact, the content is rendered by the browser, including any JavaScript that it contains. Since all cookies (except for the rememberMe one) do not set the HttpOnly flag, an attacker could steal the session of a victim and use it to impersonate them. To exploit this issue, attackers need to be able to modify the content of artifacts, which usually means they need to be able to modify a project's build spec. The exploitation requires the victim to click on an attacker's link. It can be used to elevate privileges by targeting admins of a OneDev instance. In the worst case, this can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server, because admins can create Server Shell Executors and use them to run any command on the server. This issue has been patched in version 7.3.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-3033: If a Thunderbird user replied to a crafted HTML email containing a <code>meta</code> tag, with the <code>meta</code> tag having the <code>http-equiv=\"refresh\"</code> attribute, and the content attribute specifying an URL, then Thunderbird started a network request to that URL, regardless of the configuration to block remote content. In combination with certain other HTML elements and attributes in the email, it was possible to execute JavaScript code included in the message in the context of the message compose document. The JavaScript code was able to perform actions including, but probably not limited to, read and modify the contents of the message compose document, including the quoted original message, which could potentially contain the decrypted plaintext of encrypted data in the crafted email. The contents could then be transmitted to the network, either to the URL specified in the META refresh tag, or to a different URL, as the JavaScript code could modify the URL specified in the document. This bug doesn't affect users who have changed the default Message Body display setting to 'simple html' or 'plain text'. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 102.2.1 and Thunderbird < 91.13.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-29444: Plugin Settings Change leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Cloudways Breeze plugin <= 2.0.2 on WordPress allows users with a subscriber or higher user role to execute any of the wp_ajax_* actions in the class Breeze_Configuration which includes the ability to change any of the plugin's settings including CDN setting which could be further used for XSS attack.\n\n- CVE-2021-36176: Multiple uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerabilities in the web interface of FortiPortal before 6.0.6 may allow a single low-privileged user to induce a denial of service via multiple HTTP requests.\n\n- CVE-2021-43929: Improper neutralization of special elements in output used by a downstream component ('Injection') vulnerability in work flow management in Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM) before 7.0.1-42218-2 allows remote authenticated users to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via unspecified vectors.\n\n- CVE-2022-2178: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in Saysis Computer Starcities allows Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).This issue affects Starcities: before 1.1. \n\n- CVE-2022-38628: Nortek Linear eMerge E3-Series 0.32-08f, 0.32-07p, 0.32-07e, 0.32-09c, 0.32-09b, 0.32-09a, and 0.32-08e were discovered to contain a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability which is chained with a local session fixation.

An attacker is able to inject arbitrary `CSS` into the generated graph allowing them to change the styling of elements outside of the generated graph, and potentially exfiltrate sensitive information by using specially crafted `CSS` selectors. The following example shows how an attacker can exfiltrate the contents of an input field by bruteforcing the `value` attribute one character at a time. Whenever there is an actual match, an `http` request will be made by the browser in order to \"load\" a background image that will let an attacker know what's the value of the character. This issue may lead to `Information Disclosure` via CSS selectors and functions able to generate HTTP requests.

These special elements can carry control implications. If product does not prevent external control or influence over the inclusion of such special elements, the control flow of the program may be altered from what was intended. For example, both Unix and Windows interpret the symbol < (\"less than\") as meaning \"read input from a file\".\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2001-0677: Read arbitrary files from mail client by providing a special MIME header that is internally used to store pathnames for attachments.\n\n- CVE-2000-0703: Setuid program does not cleanse special escape sequence before sending data to a mail program, causing the mail program to process those sequences.\n\n- CVE-2003-0020: Multi-channel issue. Terminal escape sequences not filtered from log files.\n\n- CVE-2003-0083: Multi-channel issue. Terminal escape sequences not filtered from log files.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-33592: NAVER Toolbar before 4.0.30.323 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted upgrade.xml file. Special characters in filename parameter can be the cause of bypassing code signing check function.\n\n- CVE-2022-0661: The Ad Injection WordPress plugin through 1.2.0.19 does not properly sanitize the body of the adverts injected into the pages, allowing a high privileged user (Admin+) to inject arbitrary HTML or javascript even with unfiltered_html disallowed, leading to a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Further it is also possible to inject PHP code, leading to a Remote Code execution (RCE) vulnerability, even if the DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT and DISALLOW_FILE_MOD constants are both set.\n\n- CVE-2022-35651: A stored XSS and blind SSRF vulnerability was found in Moodle, occurs due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied data in the SCORM track details.

The device sends unnecessary information to the cloud controller server. Although this information is sent encrypted and has low risk in isolation, it decreases the privacy of the end user. The information sent includes the local IP address being used and the SSID of the Wi-Fi network the device is connected to. (Various resources such as wigle.net can be use for mapping of SSIDs to physical locations.)\n\n- CVE-2021-24170: The REST API endpoint get_users in the User Profile Picture WordPress plugin before 2.5.0 returned more information than was required for its functionality to users with the upload_files capability. This included password hashes, hashed user activation keys, usernames, emails, and other less sensitive information.\n\n- CVE-2021-24585: The Timetable and Event Schedule WordPress plugin before 2.4.0 outputs the Hashed Password, Username and Email Address (along other less sensitive data) of the user related to the Even Head of the Timeslot in the response when requesting the event Timeslot data with a user with the edit_posts capability. Combined with the other Unauthorised Event Timeslot Modification issue (https://wpscan.com/reports/submissions/4699/) where an arbitrary user ID can be set, this could allow low privilege users with the edit_posts capability (such as author) to retrieve sensitive User data by iterating over the user_id\n\n- CVE-2021-26566: Insertion of sensitive information into sent data vulnerability in synorelayd in Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM) before 6.2.3-25426-3 allows man-in-the-middle attackers to execute arbitrary commands via inbound QuickConnect traffic.\n\n- CVE-2021-22172: Improper authorization in GitLab 12.8+ allows a guest user in a private project to view tag data that should be inaccessible on the releases page\n\n- CVE-2021-26923: An issue was discovered in Argo CD before 1.8.4.

A compromised pod with sufficient privilege is able to reconfigure the node\u2019s IPv6 interface due to the node accepting route advertisement by default, allowing the attacker to redirect full or partial network traffic from the node to the compromised pod.\n\n- CVE-2020-14371: A credential leak vulnerability was found in Red Hat Satellite. This flaw exposes the compute resources credentials through VMs that are running on these resources in Satellite.\n\n- CVE-2021-20228: A flaw was found in the Ansible Engine 2.9.18, where sensitive info is not masked by default and is not protected by the no_log feature when using the sub-option feature of the basic.py module. This flaw allows an attacker to obtain sensitive information. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality.\n\n- CVE-2021-20331:  Specific versions of the MongoDB C# Driver may erroneously publish events containing authentication-related data to a command listener configured by an application. The published events may contain security-sensitive data when commands such as \"saslStart\", \"saslContinue\", \"isMaster\", \"createUser\", and \"updateUser\" are executed. Without due care, an application may inadvertently expose this authenticated-related information, e.g., by writing it to a log file. This issue only arises if an application enables the command listener feature (this is not enabled by default). This issue affects the MongoDB C# Driver v2.12 versions prior to and including 2.12.1. \n\n- CVE-2021-26593: In Directus 8.x through 8.8.1, an attacker can see all users in the CMS using the API /users/{id}. For each call, they get in response a lot of information about the user (such as email address, first name, and last name) but also the secret for 2FA if one exists. This secret can be regenerated. NOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer\n\n- CVE-2021-28133: Zoom through 5.5.4 sometimes allows attackers to read private information on a participant's screen, even though the participant never attempted to share the private part of their screen. When a user shares a specific application window via the Share Screen functionality, other meeting participants can briefly see contents of other application windows that were explicitly not shared. The contents of these other windows can (for instance) be seen for a short period of time when they overlay the shared window and get into focus. (An attacker can, of course, use a separate screen-recorder application, unsupported by Zoom, to save all such contents for later replays and analysis.) Depending on the unintentionally shared data, this short exposure of screen contents may be a more or less severe security issue.\n\n- CVE-2021-29483: ManageWiki is an extension to the MediaWiki project. The 'wikiconfig' API leaked the value of private configuration variables set through the ManageWiki variable to all users. This has been patched by https://github.com/miraheze/ManageWiki/compare/99f3b2c8af18...befb83c66f5b.patch. If you are unable to patch set `$wgAPIListModules['wikiconfig'] = 'ApiQueryDisabled';` or remove private config as a workaround.\n\n- CVE-2021-31545: An issue was discovered in the AbuseFilter extension for MediaWiki through 1.35.2.

The Special:AbuseFilter/examine form allowed for the disclosure of suppressed MediaWiki usernames to unprivileged users.\n\n- CVE-2021-32747: Icinga Web 2 is an open source monitoring web interface, framework, and command-line interface. A vulnerability in which custom variables are exposed to unauthorized users exists between versions 2.0.0 and 2.8.2. Custom variables are user-defined keys and values on configuration objects in Icinga 2. These are commonly used to reference secrets in other configurations such as check commands to be able to authenticate with a service being checked. Icinga Web 2 displays these custom variables to logged in users with access to said hosts or services. In order to protect the secrets from being visible to anyone, it's possible to setup protection rules and blacklists in a user's role. Protection rules result in `***` being shown instead of the original value, the key will remain. Backlists will hide a custom variable entirely from the user. Besides using the UI, custom variables can also be accessed differently by using an undocumented URL parameter. By adding a parameter to the affected routes, Icinga Web 2 will show these columns additionally in the respective list. This parameter is also respected when exporting to JSON or CSV. Protection rules and blacklists however have no effect in this case. Custom variables are shown as-is in the result. The issue has been fixed in the 2.9.0, 2.8.3, and 2.7.5 releases. As a workaround, one may set up a restriction to hide hosts and services with the custom variable in question.\n\n- CVE-2020-27831: A flaw was found in Red Hat Quay, where it does not properly protect the authorization token when authorizing email addresses for repository email notifications. This flaw allows an attacker to add email addresses they do not own to repository notifications.\n\n- CVE-2021-21396: wire-server is an open-source back end for Wire, a secure collaboration platform. In wire-server from version 2021-02-16 and before version 2021-03-02, the client metadata of all users was exposed in the `GET /users/list-clients` endpoint. The endpoint could be used by any logged in user who could request client details of any other user (no connection required) as far as they can find their User ID. The exposed metadata included id, class, type, location, time, and cookie. A user on a Wire backend could use this endpoint to find registration time and location for each device for a given list of users. As a workaround, remove `/list-clients` from nginx config. This has been fixed in version 2021-03-02.\n\n- CVE-2021-21400: wire-webapp is an open-source front end for Wire, a secure collaboration platform. In wire-webapp before version 2021-03-15-production.0, when being prompted to enter the app-lock passphrase, the typed passphrase will be sent into the most recently used chat when the user does not actively give focus to the input field. Input element focus is enforced programatically in version 2021-03-15-production.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-21621: Jenkins Support Core Plugin 2.72 and earlier provides the serialized user authentication as part of the \"About user (basic authentication details only)\" information, which can include the session ID of the user creating the support bundle in some configurations.\n\n- CVE-2021-21733: The management system of ZXCDN is impacted by the information leak vulnerability.

Prior to version 4.10.4, for regular (non-LiveQuery) queries, the session token is removed from the response, but for LiveQuery payloads it is currently not. If a user has a LiveQuery subscription on the `Parse.User` class, all session tokens created during user sign-ups will be broadcast as part of the LiveQuery payload. A patch in version 4.10.4 removes session tokens from the LiveQuery payload. As a workaround, set `user.acl(new Parse.ACL())` in a beforeSave trigger to make the user private already on sign-up.\n\n- CVE-2021-41125: Scrapy is a high-level web crawling and scraping framework for Python. If you use `HttpAuthMiddleware` (i.e. the `http_user` and `http_pass` spider attributes) for HTTP authentication, all requests will expose your credentials to the request target. This includes requests generated by Scrapy components, such as `robots.txt` requests sent by Scrapy when the `ROBOTSTXT_OBEY` setting is set to `True`, or as requests reached through redirects. Upgrade to Scrapy 2.5.1 and use the new `http_auth_domain` spider attribute to control which domains are allowed to receive the configured HTTP authentication credentials. If you are using Scrapy 1.8 or a lower version, and upgrading to Scrapy 2.5.1 is not an option, you may upgrade to Scrapy 1.8.1 instead. If you cannot upgrade, set your HTTP authentication credentials on a per-request basis, using for example the `w3lib.http.basic_auth_header` function to convert your credentials into a value that you can assign to the `Authorization` header of your request, instead of defining your credentials globally using `HttpAuthMiddleware`.\n\n- CVE-2021-42089: An issue was discovered in Zammad before 4.1.1. The REST API discloses sensitive information.\n\n- CVE-2021-0602: In onCreateOptionsMenu of WifiNetworkDetailsFragment.java, there is a possible way for guest users to view and modify Wi-Fi settings for all configured APs due to a permissions bypass. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-10 Android-11Android ID: A-177573895\n\n- CVE-2021-37703: Discourse is an open-source platform for community discussion.

When the scs-library-client is used to pull a container image, with authentication, the HTTP Authorization header sent by the client to the library service may be incorrectly leaked to an S3 backing storage provider. This occurs in a specific flow, where the library service redirects the client to a backing S3 storage server, to perform a multi-part concurrent download. Depending on site configuration, the S3 service may be provided by a third party. An attacker with access to the S3 service may be able to extract user credentials, allowing them to impersonate the user. The vulnerable multi-part concurrent download flow, with redirect to S3, is only used when communicating with a Singularity Enterprise 1.x installation, or third party server implementing this flow. Interaction with Singularity Enterprise 2.x, and Singularity Container Services (cloud.sylabs.io), does not trigger the vulnerable flow. We encourage all users to update. Users who interact with a Singularity Enterprise 1.x installation, using a 3rd party S3 storage service, are advised to revoke and recreate their authentication tokens within Singularity Enterprise. There is no workaround available at this time.\n\n- CVE-2022-31130: Grafana is an open source observability and data visualization platform. Versions of Grafana for endpoints prior to 9.1.8 and 8.5.14 could leak authentication tokens to some destination plugins under some conditions. The vulnerability impacts data source and plugin proxy endpoints with authentication tokens. The destination plugin could receive a user's Grafana authentication token. Versions 9.1.8 and 8.5.14 contain a patch for this issue. As a workaround, do not use API keys, JWT authentication, or any HTTP Header based authentication.\n\n- CVE-2022-42132: The Test LDAP Users functionality in Liferay Portal 7.0.0 through 7.4.3.4, and Liferay DXP 7.0 fix pack 102 and earlier, 7.1 before fix pack 27, 7.2 before fix pack 17, 7.3 before update 4, and DXP 7.4 GA includes the LDAP credential in the page URL when paginating through the list of users, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers or attackers with access to the request logs to see the LDAP credential.\n\n- CVE-2022-31746: Internal URLs are protected by a secret UUID key, which could have been leaked to web page through the Referrer header. This vulnerability affects Firefox for iOS < 102.\n\n- CVE-2021-23937: A DNS proxy and possible amplification attack vulnerability in WebClientInfo of Apache Wicket allows an attacker to trigger arbitrary DNS lookups from the server when the X-Forwarded-For header is not properly sanitized. This DNS lookup can be engineered to overload an internal DNS server or to slow down request processing of the Apache Wicket application causing a possible denial of service on either the internal infrastructure or the web application itself. This issue affects Apache Wicket Apache Wicket 9.x version 9.2.0 and prior versions; Apache Wicket 8.x version 8.11.0 and prior versions; Apache Wicket 7.x version 7.17.0 and prior versions and Apache Wicket 6.x version 6.2.0 and later versions.\n\n- CVE-2022-0474: Full list of recipients from customer users in a contact field could be disclosed in notification emails event when the notification is set to be sent to each recipient individually.

There are currently no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-31069: NestJS Proxy is a NestJS module to decorate and proxy calls. Prior to version 0.7.0, the nestjs-proxy library did not have a way to control when Authorization headers should should be forwarded for specific backend services configured by the application developer. This could have resulted in sensitive information such as OAuth bearer access tokens being inadvertently exposed to such services that should not see them. A new feature has been introduced in the patched version of nestjs-proxy that allows application developers to opt out of forwarding the Authorization headers on a per service basis using the `forwardToken` config setting. Developers are advised to review the README for this library on Github or NPM for further details on how this configuration can be applied. This issue has been fixed in version 0.7.0 of `@finastra/nestjs-proxy`. Users of `@ffdc/nestjs-proxy` are advised that this package has been deprecated and is no longer being maintained or receiving updates. Such users should update their package.json file to use `@finastra/nestjs-proxy` instead.\n\n- CVE-2022-31070: NestJS Proxy is a NestJS module to decorate and proxy calls. Prior to version 0.7.0, the nestjs-proxy library did not have a way to block sensitive cookies (e.g. session cookies) from being forwarded to backend services configured by the application developer. This could have led to sensitive cookies being inadvertently exposed to such services that should not see them. The patched version now blocks cookies from being forwarded by default. However developers can configure an allow-list of cookie names by using the `allowedCookies` config setting. This issue has been fixed in version 0.7.0 of `@finastra/nestjs-proxy`. Users of `@ffdc/nestjs-proxy` are advised that this package has been deprecated and is no longer being maintained or receiving updates. Such users should update their package.json file to use `@finastra/nestjs-proxy` instead.\n\n- CVE-2022-3348: Just like in the previous report, an attacker could steal the account of different users. But in this case, it's a little bit more specific, because it is needed to be an editor in the same app as the victim.\n\n- CVE-2022-38113: This vulnerability discloses build and services versions in the server response header. \n\n- CVE-2022-46150: Discourse is an open-source discussion platform. Prior to version 2.8.13 of the `stable` branch and version 2.9.0.beta14 of the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches, unauthorized users may learn of the existence of hidden tags and that they have been applied to topics that they have access to. This issue is patched in version 2.8.13 of the `stable` branch and version 2.9.0.beta14 of the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches. As a workaround, use the `disable_email` site setting to disable all emails to non-staff users.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-200 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-209 (CanAlsoBe)\n\n- CWE-202 (CanAlsoBe)",

Some CMS (Content Management Systems) also use templates.\n\n\nTemplate engines often have their own custom command or expression language. If an attacker can influence input into a template before it is processed, then the attacker can invoke arbitrary expressions, i.e. perform injection attacks. For example, in some template languages, an attacker could inject the expression \"{{7*7}}\" and determine if the output returns \"49\" instead. The syntax varies depending on the language.\n\n\nIn some cases, XSS-style attacks can work, which can obscure the root cause if the developer does not closely investigate the root cause of the error.\n\n\nTemplate engines can be used on the server or client, so both \"sides\" could be affected by injection. The mechanisms of attack or the affected technologies might be different, but the mistake is fundamentally the same.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2024-34359: Chain: Python bindings for LLM library do not use a sandboxed environment when parsing a template and constructing a prompt, allowing jinja2 Server Side Template Injection and code execution - one variant of a \"prompt injection\" attack.\n\n- CVE-2017-16783: server-side template injection in content management server\n\n- CVE-2020-9437: authentication / identity management product has client-side template injection\n\n- CVE-2020-12790: Server-Side Template Injection using a Twig template\n\n- CVE-2021-21244: devops platform allows SSTI\n\n- CVE-2020-4027: bypass of Server-Side Template Injection protection mechanism with macros in Velocity templates\n\n- CVE-2020-26282: web browser proxy server allows Java EL expressions from Server-Side Template Injection\n\n- CVE-2020-1961: SSTI involving mail templates and JEXL expressions\n\n- CVE-2019-19999: product does not use a \"safe\" setting for a FreeMarker configuration, allowing SSTI\n\n- CVE-2018-20465: product allows read of sensitive database username/password variables using server-side template injection\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-25283: An issue was discovered in through SaltStack Salt before 3002.5.

There are no known workarounds known.\n\n- CVE-2021-43466: In the thymeleaf-spring5:3.0.12 component, thymeleaf combined with specific scenarios in template injection may lead to remote code execution.\n\n- CVE-2021-32817: express-hbs is an Express handlebars template engine. express-hbs mixes pure template data with engine configuration options through the Express render API. More specifically, the layout parameter may trigger file disclosure vulnerabilities in downstream applications. This potential vulnerability is somewhat restricted in that only files with existing extentions (i.e. file.extension) can be included, files that lack an extension will have .hbs appended to them. For complete details refer to the referenced GHSL-2021-019 report. Notes in documentation have been added to help users of express-hbs avoid this potential information exposure vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2021-32820: Express-handlebars is a Handlebars view engine for Express. Express-handlebars mixes pure template data with engine configuration options through the Express render API. More specifically, the layout parameter may trigger file disclosure vulnerabilities in downstream applications. This potential vulnerability is somewhat restricted in that only files with existing extentions (i.e. file.extension) can be included, files that lack an extension will have .handlebars appended to them.

For an example PoC see the referenced GHSL-2021-020.\n\n- CVE-2021-29454: Smarty is a template engine for PHP, facilitating the separation of presentation (HTML/CSS) from application logic. Prior to versions 3.1.42 and 4.0.2, template authors could run arbitrary PHP code by crafting a malicious math string. If a math string was passed through as user provided data to the math function, external users could run arbitrary PHP code by crafting a malicious math string. Users should upgrade to version 3.1.42 or 4.0.2 to receive a patch.\n\n- CVE-2021-32649: October CMS is a self-hosted content management system (CMS) platform based on the Laravel PHP Framework. Prior to versions 1.0.473 and 1.1.6, an attacker with \"create, modify and delete website pages\" privileges in the backend is able to execute PHP code by running specially crafted Twig code in the template markup. The issue has been patched in Build 473 (v1.0.473) and v1.1.6. Those unable to upgrade may apply the patch to their installation manually as a workaround.\n\n- CVE-2021-43097: A Server-side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerability exists in bbs 5.3 in TemplateManageAction.javawhich could let a malicoius user execute arbitrary code.\n\n- CVE-2021-43837: vault-cli is a configurable command-line interface tool (and python library) to interact with Hashicorp Vault. In versions before 3.0.0 vault-cli features the ability for rendering templated values. When a secret starts with the prefix `!template!`, vault-cli interprets the rest of the contents of the secret as a Jinja2 template. Jinja2 is a powerful templating engine and is not designed to safely render arbitrary templates. An attacker controlling a jinja2 template rendered on a machine can trigger arbitrary code, making this a Remote Code Execution (RCE) risk. If the content of the vault can be completely trusted, then this is not a problem. Otherwise, if your threat model includes cases where an attacker can manipulate a secret value read from the vault using vault-cli, then this vulnerability may impact you. In 3.0.0, the code related to interpreting vault templated secrets has been removed entirely. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. For users unable to upgrade a workaround does exist. Using the environment variable `VAULT_CLI_RENDER=false` or the flag `--no-render` (placed between `vault-cli` and the subcommand, e.g. `vault-cli --no-render get-all`) or adding `render: false` to the vault-cli configuration yaml file disables rendering and removes the vulnerability. Using the python library, you can use: `vault_cli.get_client(render=False)` when creating your client to get a client that will not render templated secrets and thus operates securely.\n\n- CVE-2021-46063: MCMS v5.2.5 was discovered to contain a Server Side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerability via the Template Management module.\n\n- CVE-2021-40219: Bolt CMS <= 4.2 is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution.

The key would typically identify a user-related record stored in the system and would be used to lookup that record for presentation to the user. It is likely that an attacker would have to be an authenticated user in the system. However, the authorization process would not properly check the data access operation to ensure that the authenticated user performing the operation has sufficient entitlements to perform the requested data access, hence bypassing any other authorization checks present in the system.\n\n\nFor example, attackers can look at places where user specific data is retrieved (e.g. search screens) and determine whether the key for the item being looked up is controllable externally. The key may be a hidden field in the HTML form field, might be passed as a URL parameter or as an unencrypted cookie variable, then in each of these cases it will be possible to tamper with the key value.\n\n\nOne manifestation of this weakness is when a system uses sequential or otherwise easily-guessable session IDs that would allow one user to easily switch to another user's session and read/modify their data.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-36539: An educational application does not appropriately restrict file IDs to a particular user. The attacker can brute-force guess IDs, indicating IDOR.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-26679: vFairs 3.3 is affected by Insecure Permissions.

Several APIs on the web system display, without authorization, sensitive information such as health statements, previous bills in a specific restaurant, alcohol consumption and smoking habits. Each of the described API\u2019s, has in its URL one or more MongoDB ID which is not so simple to enumerate. However, they each receive a \u2018tiny URL\u2019 in Tabit\u2019s domain, in the form of https://tbit.be/{suffix} with suffix being a 5 characters long string containing numbers, lower- and upper-case letters. It is not so simple to enumerate them all, but really easy to find some that work and lead to a personal endpoint. This is both an example of OWASP: API4 - rate limiting and OWASP: API1 - Broken object level authorization. Furthermore, the redirect URL disclosed the MongoDB IDs discussed above, and we could use them to query other endpoints disclosing more personal information. For example: The URL https://tabitisrael.co.il/online-reservations/health-statement?orgId={org_id}&healthStatementId={health_statement_id} is used to invite friends to fill a health statement before attending the restaurant. We can use the health_statement_id to access the https://tgm-api.tabit.cloud/health-statement/{health_statement_id} API which disclose medical information as well as id number.\n\n- CVE-2022-36202: Doctor's Appointment System1.0 is vulnerable to Incorrect Access Control via edoc/patient/settings.php.

A sync token is used in Seafile file syncing protocol to authorize access to library data. To improve performance, the token is cached in memory in seaf-server. Upon receiving a token from sync client or SeaDrive client, the server checks whether the token exist in the cache. However, if the token exists in cache, the server doesn't check whether it's associated with the specific library in the URL. This vulnerability makes it possible to use any valid sync token to access data from any **known** library. Note that the attacker has to first find out the ID of a library which it has no access to. The library ID is a random UUID, which is not possible to be guessed. There are no workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-1949: An access control bypass vulnerability found in 389-ds-base.

This assumption may be even stronger when the programmer has encoded the command in a way that prevents separate commands from being provided maliciously, e.g. in the case of shell metacharacters. When constructing the command, the developer may use whitespace or other delimiters that are required to separate arguments when the command. However, if an attacker can provide an untrusted input that contains argument-separating delimiters, then the resulting command will have more arguments than intended by the developer. The attacker may then be able to change the behavior of the command. Depending on the functionality supported by the extraneous arguments, this may have security-relevant consequences.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-36069: Python-based dependency management tool avoids OS command injection when generating Git commands but allows injection of optional arguments with input beginning with a dash (CWE-88), potentially allowing for code execution.\n\n- CVE-1999-0113: Canonical Example - \"-froot\" argument is passed on to another program, where the \"-f\" causes execution as user \"root\"\n\n- CVE-2001-0150: Web browser executes Telnet sessions using command line arguments that are specified by the web site, which could allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands.\n\n- CVE-2001-0667: Web browser allows remote attackers to execute commands by spawning Telnet with a log file option on the command line and writing arbitrary code into an executable file which is later executed.\n\n- CVE-2002-0985: Argument injection vulnerability in the mail function for PHP may allow attackers to bypass safe mode restrictions and modify command line arguments to the MTA (e.g. sendmail) possibly executing commands.\n\n- CVE-2003-0907: Help and Support center in windows does not properly validate HCP URLs, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via quotation marks in an \"hcp://\" URL.\n\n- CVE-2004-0121: Mail client does not sufficiently filter parameters of mailto: URLs when using them as arguments to mail executable, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary programs.\n\n- CVE-2004-0473: Web browser doesn't filter \"-\" when invoking various commands, allowing command-line switches to be specified.\n\n- CVE-2004-0480: Mail client allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a URI that uses a UNC network share pathname to provide an alternate configuration file.\n\n- CVE-2004-0489: SSH URI handler for web browser allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or conduct port forwarding via the a command line option.\n\n- CVE-2004-0411: Web browser doesn't filter \"-\" when invoking various commands, allowing command-line switches to be specified.\n\n- CVE-2005-4699: Argument injection vulnerability in TellMe 1.2 and earlier allows remote attackers to modify command line arguments for the Whois program and obtain sensitive information via \"--\" style options in the q_Host parameter.\n\n- CVE-2006-1865: Beagle before 0.2.5 can produce certain insecure command lines to launch external helper applications while indexing, which allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands.

NOTE: the discoverer states \"I believe that this vulnerability cannot actually be exploited.\"\n\n- CVE-2021-29461: Discord Recon Server is a bot that allows one to do one's reconnaissance process from one's Discord. A vulnerability in Discord Recon Server prior to 0.0.3 could be exploited to read internal files from the system and write files into the system resulting in remote code execution. This issue has been fixed in version 0.0.3. As a workaround, one may copy the code from `assets/CommandInjection.py` in the Discord Recon Server code repository and overwrite vulnerable code from one's own Discord Recon Server implementation with code that contains the patch.\n\n- CVE-2021-29472: Composer is a dependency manager for PHP. URLs for Mercurial repositories in the root composer.json and package source download URLs are not sanitized correctly. Specifically crafted URL values allow code to be executed in the HgDriver if hg/Mercurial is installed on the system. The impact to Composer users directly is limited as the composer.json file is typically under their own control and source download URLs can only be supplied by third party Composer repositories they explicitly trust to download and execute source code from, e.g. Composer plugins. The main impact is to services passing user input to Composer, including Packagist.org and Private Packagist. This allowed users to trigger remote code execution. The vulnerability has been patched on Packagist.org and Private Packagist within 12h of receiving the initial vulnerability report and based on a review of logs, to the best of our knowledge, was not abused by anyone. Other services/tools using VcsRepository/VcsDriver or derivatives may also be vulnerable and should upgrade their composer/composer dependency immediately. Versions 1.10.22 and 2.0.13 include patches for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2021-37040: There is a Parameter injection vulnerability in Huawei Smartphone.Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may cause privilege escalation of files after CIFS share mounting.\n\n- CVE-2021-43286: An issue was discovered in ThoughtWorks GoCD before 21.3.0. An attacker with privileges to create a new pipeline on a GoCD server can abuse a command-line injection in the Git URL \"Test Connection\" feature to execute arbitrary code.\n\n- CVE-2021-43809: `Bundler` is a package for managing application dependencies in Ruby. In `bundler` versions before 2.2.33, when working with untrusted and apparently harmless `Gemfile`'s, it is not expected that they lead to execution of external code, unless that's explicit in the ruby code inside the `Gemfile` itself. However, if the `Gemfile` includes `gem` entries that use the `git` option with invalid, but seemingly harmless, values with a leading dash, this can be false. To handle dependencies that come from a Git repository instead of a registry, Bundler uses various commands, such as `git clone`. These commands are being constructed using user input (e.g. the repository URL). When building the commands, Bundler versions before 2.2.33 correctly avoid Command Injection vulnerabilities by passing an array of arguments instead of a command string. However, there is the possibility that a user input starts with a dash (`-`) and is therefore treated as an optional argument instead of a positional one. This can lead to Code Execution because some of the commands have options that can be leveraged to run arbitrary executables. Since this value comes from the `Gemfile` file, it can contain any character, including a leading dash. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker has to craft a directory containing a `Gemfile` file that declares a dependency that is located in a Git repository. This dependency has to have a Git URL in the form of `-u./payload`. This URL will be used to construct a Git clone command but will be interpreted as the upload-pack argument. Then this directory needs to be shared with the victim, who then needs to run a command that evaluates the Gemfile, such as `bundle lock`, inside. This vulnerability can lead to Arbitrary Code Execution, which could potentially lead to the takeover of the system. However, the exploitability is very low, because it requires a lot of user interaction. Bundler 2.2.33 has patched this problem by inserting `--` as an argument before any positional arguments to those Git commands that were affected by this issue. Regardless of whether users can upgrade or not, they should review any untrustred `Gemfile`'s before running any `bundler` commands that may read them, since they can contain arbitrary ruby code.\n\n- CVE-2022-21187: The package libvcs before 0.11.1 are vulnerable to Command Injection via argument injection. When calling the update_repo function (when using hg), the url parameter is passed to the hg clone command. By injecting some hg options it was possible to get arbitrary command execution.\n\n- CVE-2022-21223: The package cocoapods-downloader before 1.6.2 are vulnerable to Command Injection via hg argument injection. When calling the download function (when using hg), the url (and/or revision, tag, branch) is passed to the hg clone command in a way that additional flags can be set. The additional flags can be used to perform a command injection.\n\n- CVE-2022-21235: The package github.com/masterminds/vcs before 1.13.3 are vulnerable to Command Injection via argument injection. When hg is executed, argument strings are passed to hg in a way that additional flags can be set. The additional flags can be used to perform a command injection.\n\n- CVE-2022-24433: The package simple-git before 3.3.0 are vulnerable to Command Injection via argument injection. When calling the .fetch(remote, branch, handlerFn) function, both the remote and branch parameters are passed to the git fetch subcommand. By injecting some git options it was possible to get arbitrary command execution.\n\n- CVE-2022-24440: The package cocoapods-downloader before 1.6.0, from 1.6.2 and before 1.6.3 are vulnerable to Command Injection via git argument injection. When calling the Pod::Downloader.preprocess_options function and using git, both the git and branch parameters are passed to the git ls-remote subcommand in a way that additional flags can be set. The additional flags can be used to perform a command injection.\n\n- CVE-2022-25648: The package git before 1.11.0 are vulnerable to Command Injection via git argument injection. When calling the fetch(remote = 'origin', opts = {}) function, the remote parameter is passed to the git fetch subcommand in a way that additional flags can be set. The additional flags can be used to perform a command injection.\n\n- CVE-2022-25766: The package ungit before 1.5.20 are vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) via argument injection. The issue occurs when calling the /api/fetch endpoint. User controlled values (remote and ref) are passed to the git fetch command. By injecting some git options it was possible to get arbitrary command execution.\n\n- CVE-2022-25865: The package workspace-tools before 0.18.4 are vulnerable to Command Injection via git argument injection. When calling the fetchRemoteBranch(remote: string, remoteBranch: string, cwd: string) function, both the remote and remoteBranch parameters are passed to the git fetch subcommand in a way that additional flags can be set. The additional flags can be used to perform a command injection.\n\n- CVE-2022-25866: The package czproject/git-php before 4.0.3 are vulnerable to Command Injection via git argument injection. When calling the isRemoteUrlReadable($url, array $refs = NULL) function, both the url and refs parameters are passed to the git ls-remote subcommand in a way that additional flags can be set. The additional flags can be used to perform a command injection.\n\n- CVE-2022-25900: All versions of package git-clone are vulnerable to Command Injection due to insecure usage of the --upload-pack feature of git.\n\n- CVE-2022-26532: A argument injection vulnerability in the 'packet-trace' CLI command of Zyxel USG/ZyWALL series firmware versions 4.09 through 4.71, USG FLEX series firmware versions 4.50 through 5.21, ATP series firmware versions 4.32 through 5.21, VPN series firmware versions 4.30 through 5.21, NSG series firmware versions 1.00 through 1.33 Patch 4, NXC2500 firmware version 6.10(AAIG.3) and earlier versions, NAP203 firmware version 6.25(ABFA.7) and earlier versions, NWA50AX firmware version 6.25(ABYW.5) and earlier versions, WAC500 firmware version 6.30(ABVS.2) and earlier versions, and WAX510D firmware version 6.30(ABTF.2) and earlier versions, that could allow a local authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary OS commands by including crafted arguments to the CLI command.\n\n- CVE-2022-36069: Poetry is a dependency manager for Python. When handling dependencies that come from a Git repository instead of a registry, Poetry uses various commands, such as `git clone`. These commands are constructed using user input (e.g. the repository URL). When building the commands, Poetry correctly avoids Command Injection vulnerabilities by passing an array of arguments instead of a command string. However, there is the possibility that a user input starts with a dash (`-`) and is therefore treated as an optional argument instead of a positional one. This can lead to Code Execution because some of the commands have options that can be leveraged to run arbitrary executables. If a developer is exploited, the attacker could steal credentials or persist their access. If the exploit happens on a server, the attackers could use their access to attack other internal systems. Since this vulnerability requires a fair amount of user interaction, it is not as dangerous as a remotely exploitable one. However, it still puts developers at risk when dealing with untrusted files in a way they think is safe, because the exploit still works when the victim tries to make sure nothing can happen, e.g. by vetting any Git or Poetry config files that might be present in the directory. Versions 1.1.9 and 1.2.0b1 contain patches for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-37027: Ahsay AhsayCBS 9.1.4.0 allows an authenticated system user to inject arbitrary Java JVM options. Administrators that can modify the Runtime Options in the web interface can inject Java Runtime Options. These take effect after a restart. For example, an attacker can enable JMX services and consequently achieve remote code execution as the system user.\n\n- CVE-2022-23221: H2 Console before 2.1.210 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a jdbc:h2:mem JDBC URL containing the IGNORE_UNKNOWN_SETTINGS=TRUE;FORBID_CREATION=FALSE;INIT=RUNSCRIPT substring, a different vulnerability than CVE-2021-42392.\n\n- CVE-2022-24066: The package simple-git before 3.5.0 are vulnerable to Command Injection due to an incomplete fix of [CVE-2022-24433](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-SIMPLEGIT-2421199) which only patches against the git fetch attack vector. A similar use of the --upload-pack feature of git is also supported for git clone, which the prior fix didn't cover.\n\n- CVE-2022-24376: All versions of package git-promise are vulnerable to Command Injection due to an inappropriate fix of a prior [vulnerability](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-GITPROMISE-567476) in this package. **Note:** Please note that the vulnerability will not be fixed. The README file was updated with a warning regarding this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-24437: The package git-pull-or-clone before 2.0.2 are vulnerable to Command Injection due to the use of the --upload-pack feature of git which is also supported for git clone. The source includes the use of the secure child process API spawn(). However, the outpath parameter passed to it may be a command-line argument to the git clone command and result in arbitrary command injection.\n\n- CVE-2021-46850: myVesta Control Panel before 0.9.8-26-43 and Vesta Control Panel before 0.9.8-26 are vulnerable to command injection. An authenticated and remote administrative user can execute arbitrary commands via the v_sftp_license parameter when sending HTTP POST requests to the /edit/server endpoint.\n\n- CVE-2022-24953: The Crypt_GPG extension before 1.6.7 for PHP does not prevent additional options in GPG calls, which presents a risk for certain environments and GPG versions.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-77 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-74 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-77 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-77 (ChildOf)",

          "type": "Base",
          "extended_description": "\n\nCross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:\n\n\n  1. Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.\n\n  1. The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.\n\n  1. During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.\n\n  1. A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.\n\n  1. Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.\n\n  1. This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.\n\nThere are three main kinds of XSS:\n\n  -  **Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent)**  - The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.\n\n  -  **Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent)**  - The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs. \n\n  -  **Type 0: DOM-Based XSS**  - In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible. \n\nOnce the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"\n\nIn many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.\n",

However, including unexpected data in an HTTP header allows an attacker to specify the entirety of the HTTP message that is rendered by the client HTTP agent (e.g., web browser) or back-end HTTP agent (e.g., web server), whether the message is part of a request or a response. \n\n\nWhen an HTTP request contains unexpected CR and LF characters, the server may respond with an output stream that is interpreted as \"splitting\" the stream into two different HTTP messages instead of one. CR is carriage return, also given by %0d or \\r, and LF is line feed, also given by %0a or \\n.\n\n\nIn addition to CR and LF characters, other valid/RFC compliant special characters and unique character encodings can be utilized, such as HT (horizontal tab, also given by %09 or \\t) and SP (space, also given as + sign or %20).\n\n\nThese types of unvalidated and unexpected data in HTTP message headers allow an attacker to control the second \"split\" message to mount attacks such as server-side request forgery, cross-site scripting, and cache poisoning attacks.\n\n\nHTTP response splitting weaknesses may be present when:\n\n\n  1. Data enters a web application through an untrusted source, most frequently an HTTP request.\n\n  1. The data is included in an HTTP response header sent to a web user without neutralizing malicious characters that can be interpreted as separator characters for headers.\n\n",

Web applications often mistakenly make the assumption that data passed to the client in hidden fields or cookies is not susceptible to tampering. Improper validation of data that are user-controllable can lead to the application processing incorrect, and often malicious, input.\n\n\nFor example, custom cookies commonly store session data or persistent data across sessions. This kind of session data is normally involved in security related decisions on the server side, such as user authentication and access control. Thus, the cookies might contain sensitive data such as user credentials and privileges. This is a dangerous practice, as it can often lead to improper reliance on the value of the client-provided cookie by the server side application.\n",

The attacker could then use a modified client to replay the stolen hash without having knowledge of the original password.\n\n\nAs a result, the server-side comparison against a client-side hash does not provide any more security than the use of passwords without hashing.\n",
