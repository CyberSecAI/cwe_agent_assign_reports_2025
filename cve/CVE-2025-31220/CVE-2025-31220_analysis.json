CWE-284 [Improper Access Control] was considered but is a higher-level Pillar. CWE-497 is a more specific description of the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe497[\"CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe497 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe497 primary\n    class cwe284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the application's **failure to properly prevent sensitive location information from being accessed by unauthorized applications**, leading to the exposure of that information.\n- **Root Cause:** **Failure to properly prevent sensitive information exposure** (CWE-497)\n- **Impact:** A malicious app can read sensitive location information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the exposure of sensitive location information to unauthorized applications. The retriever results suggested several CWEs, including CWE-787 [Out-of-bounds Write] and CWE-843 [Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')], but these were not directly related to the described vulnerability. The key evidence for the chosen mapping is the statement: \"**Sensitive location information could be read by a malicious app**\". This directly implies that the system failed to adequately protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.\n\nCWE-497 [Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere] accurately captures this **failure to prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors**. While CWE-284 [Improper Access Control] was considered, CWE-497 is a more specific and accurate representation of the weakness.\n\nTherefore, the final selection of CWE-497 is based on the direct evidence from the vulnerability description, the CWE's specific focus on sensitive information exposure, and its appropriate level of abstraction.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-451: User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.66\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe user interface (UI) does not properly represent critical information to the user, allowing the information - or its source - to be obscured or spoofed.
