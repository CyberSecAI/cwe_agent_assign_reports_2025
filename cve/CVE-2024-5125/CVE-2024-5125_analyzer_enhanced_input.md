# Vulnerability Description

    parisneo/lollms-webui version 9.6 is vulnerable to **Cross-Site Scripting** (XSS) and **Open Redirect** due to inadequate input validation and processing of SVG files during the upload process. The **XSS vulnerability** allows attackers to embed malicious JavaScript code within SVG files, which is executed upon rendering, leading to potential credential theft and unauthorized data access. The **Open Redirect** vulnerability arises from insufficient URL validation within SVG files, enabling attackers to redirect users to malicious websites, thereby exposing them to phishing attacks, malware distribution, and reputation damage. These vulnerabilities are present in the applications functionality to send files to the AI module.
