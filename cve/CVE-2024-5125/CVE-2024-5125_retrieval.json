The **XSS vulnerability** allows attackers to embed malicious JavaScript code within SVG files, which is executed upon rendering, leading to potential credential theft and unauthorized data access. The **Open Redirect** vulnerability arises from insufficient URL validation within SVG files, enabling attackers to redirect users to malicious websites, thereby exposing them to phishing attacks, malware distribution, and reputation damage. These vulnerabilities are present in the applications functionality to send files to the AI module.', key_phrases={'rootcause': [\"['inadequate input validation'\", \"'insufficient URL validation']\"], 'weakness': ['Cross-Site Scripting', 'Open Redirect', 'XSS vulnerability'], 'impact': ['credential theft', 'phishing', 'redirect users to malicious websites', 'unauthorized data access'], 'vector': 'malicious SVG files', 'attacker': 'attackers', 'product': 'parisneo/lollms-webui', 'version': '9.6', 'component': ''}, reference_content=\"The provided content is a commit diff from a GitHub repository.

    "enhanced_query": "# Vulnerability Description\n\n    parisneo/lollms-webui version 9.6 is vulnerable to **Cross-Site Scripting** (XSS) and **Open Redirect** due to inadequate input validation and processing of SVG files during the upload process. The **XSS vulnerability** allows attackers to embed malicious JavaScript code within SVG files, which is executed upon rendering, leading to potential credential theft and unauthorized data access. The **Open Redirect** vulnerability arises from insufficient URL validation within SVG files, enabling attackers to redirect users to malicious websites, thereby exposing them to phishing attacks, malware distribution, and reputation damage. These vulnerabilities are present in the applications functionality to send files to the AI module.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## ROOTCAUSE: '['inadequate input validation''\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1.
