  "description": "Improper Access Control vulnerability in Apache Commons. A special BeanIntrospector class was added in version 1.9.2. This can be used to stop attackers from using the declared class property of Java enum objects to get access to the classloader. However this protection was not enabled by default. PropertyUtilsBean (and consequently BeanUtilsBean) now disallows declared class level property access by default. Releases 1.11.0 and 2.0.0-M2 address a potential security issue when accessing enum properties in an uncontrolled way. If an application using Commons BeanUtils passes property paths from an external source directly to the getProperty() method of PropertyUtilsBean, an attacker can access the enums class loader via the declaredClass property available on all Java enum objects. Accessing the enums declaredClass allows remote attackers to access the ClassLoader and execute arbitrary code. The same issue exists with PropertyUtilsBean.getNestedProperty(). Starting in versions 1.11.0 and 2.0.0-M2 a special BeanIntrospector suppresses the declaredClass property. Note that this new BeanIntrospector is enabled by default, but you can disable it to regain the old behavior see section 2.5 of the users guide and the unit tests. This issue affects Apache Commons BeanUtils 1.x before 1.11.0, and 2.x before 2.0.0-M2.Users of the artifact commons-beanutilscommons-beanutils 1.x are recommended to upgrade to version 1.11.0, which fixes the issue. Users of the artifact org.apache.commonscommons-beanutils2 2.x are recommended to upgrade to version 2.0.0-M2, which fixes the issue.",

This is supported by the vulnerability description stating \"**improper access control**\" and \"**accessing the enums declaredClass allows remote attackers to access the ClassLoader and execute arbitrary code**\". While CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere) could be considered, it's a higher-level class and less specific than CWE-863. The final impact is arbitrary code execution, which could be linked to CWE-94 (Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')), as a secondary effect. The final conclusion depends on whether the application had authorization checks, albeit implemented incorrectly.
