The PoC file `memcpy_int_underflow.poc` contains malicious input.\n- CVE-2024-57822: Running `raptor-asan/utils/rapper -i nquads heap_read_overflow.poc` triggers the heap read overflow. The PoC file `heap_read_overflow.poc` contains malicious input.\n\nMitigation/Fix: Upgrade to raptor2 2.0.16-6.  A patch for CVE-2024-57823 involves removing the `#if defined(RAPTOR_DEBUG)` around `RAPTOR_FATAL` calls in `raptor_rfc2396.c`.\n```",

The \"Retriever Results\" list several CWEs related to buffer overflows and integer handling, indicating potential related issues but the vulnerability description clearly indicates a **heap-based buffer over-read** condition. The relationship highlights that CWE-126 is a more specific type of out-of-bounds read.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe126[\"CWE-126: Buffer Over-read\"]\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    \n    cwe126 -->|CHILDOF| cwe125\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe126 primary\n    class cwe125 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the **heap-based buffer over-read** due to parsing triples with the nquads parser in `raptor_ntriples_parse_term_internal()`. This leads to reading beyond the allocated memory, potentially causing information disclosure or application crashes. The root cause is the **improper** handling or validation during the parsing process, resulting in the **over-read**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that there is a **heap-based buffer over-read** in the Raptor RDF Syntax Library. The primary weakness is identified as CWE-126 (**Buffer Over-read**). The high confidence is based on the direct match between the vulnerability description and the CWE definition.\nThe evidence supporting this decision is taken directly from:\n\"In Raptor RDF Syntax Library through 2.0.16, there is a **heap-based buffer over-read** when parsing triples with the nquads parser in raptor_ntriples_parse_term_internal().\"\nThe Retriever results also support this with the highest score.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-617: Reachable Assertion\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains an assert() or similar statement that can be triggered by an attacker, which leads to an application exit or other behavior that is more severe than necessary.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or

level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**:

or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-126: Buffer Over-read\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**:

buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-674: Uncontrolled Recursion\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly control the amount of recursion that takes place,  consuming excessive resources, such as allocated memory or the program stack.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-252: Unchecked Return Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.67\n**Source**:

as long to integer, data can be omitted or translated in a way that produces unexpected values. If the resulting values are used in a sensitive context, then dangerous behaviors may occur.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 618.50\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs a calculation that can\n         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic\n         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than\n         the original value.
