The script does not properly sanitize user-supplied input from HTTP POST parameters before using them in system commands executed via `popen`.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- CWE-77 - Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command (\u2018Command Injection\u2019)\n- OS Command Injection\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\nArbitrary command execution on the affected device.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- Network-accessible HTTP POST requests to the `internet.cgi` script with crafted parameters (`dest`, `hostnet`, `netmask`, `gateway`, `interface`, `custom_interface`, `comment`).\n- Authenticated access is required (session cookie check), but the vulnerability exists after successful authentication.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- Network access to the Wavlink AC3000 router.\n- Valid session cookie (authenticated user).\n- Ability to craft malicious HTTP POST requests.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\nThe report states the product has been discontinued, but patches were being worked on as of late 2024. No specific mitigation is provided in the report beyond patching.\n\n**Additional Details (more detail than official CVE description):**\n\n*   **Affected Product:** Wavlink AC3000 M33A8.V5030.210505\n*   **Vulnerable Function:** `set_add_routing()` in `internet.cgi`\n*   **Specific Parameters Vulnerable:** `dest`, `hostnet`, `netmask`, `gateway`, `interface`, `custom_interface`, and `comment` HTTP POST parameters.\n*   The report details the specific code locations where the vulnerabilities exist and how the input is used in system commands.\n*   Multiple CVEs are associated with this report: CVE-2024-39762, CVE-2024-39763, CVE-2024-39764, CVE-2024-39765. Each CVE corresponds to a specific parameter that is vulnerable to command injection.\n*   CVSSv3 Score: 9.1 (Critical)",

CWE-78 is a child of the class-level CWE-77. This parent-child relationship indicates a potential for generalization if the evidence didn't clearly point to OS command injection, but in this case, the evidence is strong.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')\"]\n    \n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe77 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper neutralization** of input within the `set_add_routing` function in `internet.cgi`. This leads to **OS command injection**, ultimately resulting in arbitrary command execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is strongly based on the provided evidence, specifically the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" which explicitly mentions \"**OS command injection**\" and \"CWE-77 - Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command (\u2018Command Injection\u2019)\". The vulnerability description also explicitly states \"**OS command injection** vulnerabilities\". The retriever results also give a high score to CWE-78.\n\nCWE-78 is the optimal level of specificity because it accurately describes the vulnerability as an **OS command injection** issue, rather than a more general command injection.\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-790: Improper Filtering of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives data from an upstream component, but does not filter or incorrectly filters special elements before sending it to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-134: Use of Externally-Controlled Format String\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a function that accepts a format string as an argument, but the format string originates from an external source.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
