# Vulnerability Description

    In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ax25 Fix **reference count leak** issue of net_device There is a **reference count leak** issue of the object net_device in ax25_dev_device_down(). When the ax25 device is shutting down, the ax25_dev_device_down() drops the reference count of net_device one or zero times depending on if we goto unlock_put or not, which will cause **memory leak**. In order to solve the above issue, decrease the reference count of net_device after dev->ax25_ptr is set to null.

    ## WEAKNESS: 'memory leak'

Relevant CWEs for this WEAKNESS:

### 1. CWE-911: Improper Update of Reference Count (Score: 578.98)

The product uses a reference count to manage a resource, but it does not update or incorrectly updates the reference count....

### 2. CWE-401: Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime (Score: 468.06)

The product does not sufficiently track and release allocated memory after it has been used, which slowly consumes remaining memory....

### 3. CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound (Score: 444.17)

The product performs a calculation that can
         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic
         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than
         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is
         incremented to a value that is too large to st...

### 4. CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') (Score: 439.00)

The product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently....
