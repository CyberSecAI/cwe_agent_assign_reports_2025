  "description": "A vulnerability in the `/3/ImportFiles` endpoint of h2oai/h2o-3 version 3.46.1 allows an attacker to cause a denial of service. The endpoint takes a single GET parameter, `path`, which can be recursively set to reference itself. This leads the server to repeatedly call its own endpoint, eventually filling up the request queue and leaving the server unable to handle other requests.",

CWE-770 [Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling] is a Base-level CWE and a parent of CWE-789 [Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value]. CWE-770 is a more specific type of resource consumption that involves allocating resources without limits. Since the vulnerability involves the server repeatedly calling its own endpoint, eventually filling up the request queue, CWE-770 is a relevant secondary CWE to consider.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe789[\"CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\"]\n    \n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    cwe789 -->|CHILDOF| cwe770\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe400 primary\n    class cwe770 secondary\n    class cwe789 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the attacker providing a crafted request to the `/3/ImportFiles` endpoint. This request causes the server to recursively call its own endpoint, leading to **uncontrolled resource consumption** and ultimately resulting in a denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly indicates that the server is experiencing a denial of service due to a recursive call to its own endpoint, which fills up the request queue. The primary cause is the **uncontrolled resource consumption** (CWE-400) due to the recursive nature of the endpoint call. While CWE-770 [Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling] could also apply, CWE-400 is the more general and appropriate root cause.\n\nThe evidence from the vulnerability description is: \"The endpoint takes a single GET parameter, `path`, which can be recursively set to reference itself. This leads the server to repeatedly call its own endpoint, eventually filling up the request queue and leaving the server unable to handle other requests.\"\n\nCWE-306 [Missing Authentication for Critical Function], CWE-639 [Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key], CWE-201 [Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data], CWE-23 [Relative Path Traversal], CWE-863 [Incorrect Authorization], and CWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')] were considered but do not directly apply to this vulnerability. The vulnerability is not related to authentication, authorization, information leakage, or input validation, but rather to the exhaustion of resources due to the recursive call.\n\nI am selecting CWE-400 as the primary CWE because it accurately reflects the **uncontrolled resource consumption** leading to a denial of service. CWE-770 is selected as a secondary CWE because the recursive calls lead to resource allocation without limits or throttling.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
