## Vulnerability Description
Schule is open-source school management system software. The generateOTP() function generates a 4-digit numeric One-Time Password (OTP). Prior to version 1.0.1, even if a secure random number generator is used, the short length and limited range (10009999) results in only 9000 possible combinations. This small keyspace makes the OTP highly vulnerable to brute-force attacks, especially in the absence of strong rate-limiting or lockout mechanisms. Version 1.0.1 fixes the issue.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **component:** generateOTP() function
- **weakness:** **brute-force attacks, short length, limited range (10009999)**
- **product:** Schule
- **version:** prior to 1.0.1

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-48372 based on provided content

The provided content relates to CVE-2025-48372. It provides more detail than the placeholder CVE description.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The `generateOTP()` function generates a 4-digit numeric One-Time Password (OTP). This results in a small keyspace of only 9000 possible combinations.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Short OTP length (4 digits).
*   Limited range of OTP values (1000-9999).
*   Vulnerability to brute-force attacks due to the small keyspace.
*   Lack of strong rate-limiting or lockout mechanisms (mentioned as exacerbating the issue).

**Impact of exploitation:**

Successful brute-force attacks against the OTP could allow unauthorized access to user accounts.

**Attack vectors:**

*   Brute-force attacks targeting the OTP generation endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to repeatedly request OTPs and attempt to guess the correct code.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   Increase the length of the OTP to create a larger keyspace. The code was updated to generate 7-digit OTPs (`rand(1000000, 9999999)`).
*   Implement strong rate-limiting to prevent attackers from making too many requests in a short period.
*   Implement account lockout mechanisms after a certain number of failed OTP attempts.
