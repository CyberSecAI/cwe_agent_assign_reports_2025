# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-39936
## Query
An issue was discovered in HTTP2 in Qt before 5.15.18, 6.x before 6.2.13, 6.3.x through 6.5.x before 6.5.7, and 6.6.x through 6.7.x before 6.7.3. Code to make security-relevant decisions about an established connection may execute too early, because the encrypted() signal has not yet been emitted and processed..

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: 'encrypted() signal not emitted'
- **weakness**: 'timing issue'
