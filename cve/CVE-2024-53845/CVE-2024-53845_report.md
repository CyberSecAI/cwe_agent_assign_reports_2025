# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-53845

## Description

ESPTouch is a connection protocol for internet of things devices. In the ESPTouchV2 protocol, while there is an option to use a custom AES key, there is no option to set the IV (Initialization Vector) prior to versions 5.3.2, 5.2.4, 5.1.6, and 5.0.8. The IV is set to zero and remains constant throughout the products lifetime. In AES/CBC mode, if the IV is not properly initialized, the encrypted output becomes deterministic, leading to potential data leakage. To address the aforementioned issues, the application generates a random IV when activating the AES key starting in versions 5.3.2, 5.2.4, 5.1.6, and 5.0.8. This IV is then transmitted along with the provision data to the provision device. The provision device has also been equipped with a parser for the AES IV. The upgrade is applicable for all applications and users of ESPTouch v2 component from ESP-IDF. As it is implemented in the ESP Wi-Fi stack, there is no workaround for the user to fix the application layer without upgrading the underlying firmware.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship influencing the selection is that CWE-329 is a variant of CWE-1204, providing a more specific description of the vulnerability when using CBC mode. CWE-1204 is the more general case and represents the root cause, while CWE-329 is a specific instantiation of that root cause. The hierarchical relationship (CWE-329 ChildOf CWE-1204) guides the selection of the more specific CWE-329 when the details support it.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **generation of a weak IV (CWE-1204)**, which leads to a specific instance in CBC mode (**CWE-329**). The impact of this is deterministic encrypted output, potentially resulting in data leakage.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and the CVE reference links. The vulnerability lies in the **lack of proper initialization of the Initialization Vector (IV)** in the ESPTouchV2 protocol. The **IV is set to zero and remains constant**, which leads to predictable encrypted output when using AES/CBC mode.

The primary CWE selected is CWE-1204: Generation of Weak Initialization Vector (IV), as this accurately represents the **root cause** of the vulnerability. The IV is not sufficiently unpredictable or unique.

CWE-329: Generation of Predictable IV with CBC Mode is considered as a secondary CWE because the vulnerability description specifically mentions the use of AES/CBC mode, making this a relevant variant.

The selection of CWE-1204 as the primary CWE and CWE-329 as a secondary CWE is based on the evidence from the vulnerability description, the CVE reference links, and the hierarchical relationship between the CWEs.
