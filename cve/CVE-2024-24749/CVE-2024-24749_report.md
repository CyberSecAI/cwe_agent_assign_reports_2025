# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-24749

## Description

GeoServer is an open source server that allows users to share and edit geospatial data. Prior to versions 2.23.5 and 2.24.3, if GeoServer is deployed in the Windows operating system using an Apache Tomcat web application server, it is possible to **bypass existing input validation** in the GeoWebCache ByteStreamController class and read arbitrary classpath resources with specific file name extensions. If GeoServer is also deployed as a web archive using the data directory embedded in the `geoserver.war` file (rather than an external data directory), it will likely be possible to read specific resources to gain administrator privileges. However, it is very unlikely that production environments will be using the embedded data directory since, depending on how GeoServer is deployed, it will be erased and re-installed (which would also reset to the **default password**) either every time the server restarts or every time a new GeoServer WAR is installed and is therefore difficult to maintain. An external data directory will always be used if GeoServer is running in standalone mode (via an installer or a binary). Versions 2.23.5 and 2.24.3 contain a patch for the issue. Some workarounds are available. One may change from a Windows environment to a Linux environment or change from Apache Tomcat to Jetty application server. One may also disable anonymous access to the embeded GeoWebCache administration and status pages.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis

The primary weakness is **CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')**. The product **bypasses existing input validation**, which allows an attacker to read arbitrary classpath resources. This can potentially lead to **CWE-73 External Control of File Name or Path**, as the attacker can control the path used in filesystem operations. If the GeoServer instance is configured with default credentials or the attacker can read configuration files to obtain credentials, it can lead to **CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization**, allowing the attacker to **gain administrator privileges**.

## Vulnerability Chain

The vulnerability chain starts with **CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')**, where **bypassing existing input validation** enables reading arbitrary files. This leads to **CWE-73 External Control of File Name or Path**, which could then result in **CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization** if the attacker can access credentials or configuration files. The ultimate impact is **gain administrator privileges**.

## Summary of Analysis

The primary weakness is **CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')**, as the vulnerability stems from the application's failure to properly restrict file pathnames, leading to potential exposure of sensitive information and privilege escalation. This is supported by the vulnerability description that details the ability to **bypass existing input validation** and read arbitrary classpath resources.

The other candidate CWEs, such as **CWE-73 External Control of File Name or Path** and **CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization**, are secondary because they represent potential consequences of the initial **path traversal** vulnerability.

The selection is based on the provided evidence and the relationship analysis, which suggests that the **path traversal** is the root cause. The chosen CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, providing a detailed and accurate representation of the vulnerability.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)

## CWE-917: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')
This CWE was considered, but is less appropriate than **CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')** as the vulnerability is more directly related to file path manipulation than expression language injection.

## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
This CWE was considered, but it is too high-level and doesn't provide specific details about the nature of the vulnerability. It is discouraged to use this CWE.

## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence
This CWE was considered, but is less appropriate than **CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')** as the vulnerability is more directly related to file path manipulation than path equivalence.

## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')
This CWE was considered, but is less appropriate than **CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')** as the vulnerability is more directly related to file path manipulation than injection. It is discouraged to use this CWE.

## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere
This CWE was considered, but it is not as precise as **CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')** or **CWE-73 External Control of File Name or Path**.

## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm
This CWE was considered, but it doesn't fit since the issue isn't related to the authentication algorithm itself, but rather to the ability to access resources and potentially **gain administrator privileges** through other means.

## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal
This CWE was considered, but **CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')** is a more general case of path traversal.

## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path
This CWE was considered and it can be a secondary CWE since it is a consequence of the primary weakness, **CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')**.

## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements
This CWE was considered, but it is a Class and it might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
This CWE was considered, but it is not as precise as **CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')** or **CWE-73 External Control of File Name or Path**.
