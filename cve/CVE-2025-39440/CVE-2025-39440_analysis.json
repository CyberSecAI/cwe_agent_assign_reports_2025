The vulnerability description indicates Stored XSS, which is directly related to improper neutralization of input during web page generation. |\n| CWE-352 | Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) | 0.8 | Compound | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The vulnerability description mentions Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) as a contributing factor that allows for Stored XSS. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary weakness is CWE-79, which is caused by the **improper neutralization of input**. The vulnerability description indicates that a CSRF vulnerability exists (CWE-352), which allows for the stored XSS (CWE-79). CWE-352 can potentially precede CWE-79 if the CSRF vulnerability is used to inject malicious code that leads to XSS.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    \n    cwe352 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe79\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe79 primary\n    class cwe352 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** vulnerability (CWE-352), which is then exploited to inject malicious code. This malicious code is not properly neutralized, leading to a **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** vulnerability (CWE-79).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that there is a \"Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability\" that leads to \"Stored XSS\". Based on this, CWE-79 is the primary weakness, as it describes the root cause of the XSS vulnerability: **improper neutralization of input**. CWE-352 is a secondary weakness, as it allows an attacker to inject malicious code. The Retriever Results also support this, with CWE-79 having the highest score. The graph relationships show that CWE-352 can precede CWE-79. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, as they accurately represent the weaknesses described in the vulnerability description.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.\n\n\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web server receives a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
