  "description": "A **lack of code signature verification** in Parallels Desktop for Mac v19.3.0 and below allows attackers to escalate privileges via a crafted macOS installer, because Parallels Service is setuid root.",

  },
  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe root cause lies in Parallels Desktop's use of a `setuid` binary, `Parallels Service`, to execute the `createinstallmedia` command as root. The `repack_osx_install_app.sh` script, responsible for handling macOS installer applications, was not verifying the code signature of `createinstallmedia` before execution. This allowed an attacker to replace the legitimate `createinstallmedia` binary within a specially crafted macOS installer app with a malicious one.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- **Lack of code signature verification:** The primary vulnerability was the absence of code signature verification on the `createinstallmedia` binary within the `repack_osx_install_app.sh` script before executing it as root.\n- **Abuse of setuid binary:** The use of `setuid` binary `Parallels Service` that runs the vulnerable `repack_osx_install_app.sh` as root allowed the exploit to gain root privileges.\n- **Trust in macOS installer structure:** Parallels Desktop was trusting the structure of macOS installer applications without proper validation.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- **Local Privilege Escalation:** A local attacker could gain root privileges by exploiting this vulnerability.\n- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** With root privileges, the attacker can execute any code on the affected system, potentially leading to full system compromise.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- The attacker crafts a malicious macOS installer application containing a modified `createinstallmedia` binary.\n- The attacker convinces Parallels Desktop to open the crafted application.\n- `Parallels Service`, running with root privileges, executes `repack_osx_install_app.sh`.\n- The script executes the malicious `createinstallmedia` without signature verification, leading to arbitrary code execution as root.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious macOS installer application.\n- The attacker needs to be able to convince the user to load this application into Parallels Desktop.\n- No prior root access is required, as the vulnerability provides local privilege escalation.\n\n**Additional details:**\n- This vulnerability only affects x86_64-based macOS machines because the vulnerable code path involving `createinstallmedia` is not used on Apple Silicon Macs, which use IPSW restore images.\n- The vulnerability was present in Parallels Desktop versions 16.0.0 through 19.3.0 and fixed in version 19.3.1 with the addition of a code signature check for `createinstallmedia`.\n- The fix implemented in version 19.3.1 verifies the code signature of `createinstallmedia` against `anchor apple` to ensure it is signed by Apple before executing it.\n\nThis analysis provides more detailed information than the official CVE description which is a placeholder.",

While CWE-347 is a child of CWE-345 (Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity), CWE-347 is more specific, relating to cryptographic signatures. CWE-250 is a child of CWE-269 (Improper Privilege Management), but CWE-250 is more specific as it addresses the case where code is executed with higher privileges than necessary.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe347[\"CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature\"]\n    cwe250[\"CWE-250: Execution with Unnecessary Privileges\"]\n    cwe345[\"CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\"]\n    cwe269[\"CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management\"]\n    \n    cwe347 -->|CHILDOF| cwe345\n    cwe250 -->|CHILDOF| cwe269\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe347 primary\n    class cwe250 secondary\n    class cwe345,cwe269 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of code signature verification (CWE-347)**. Because the `Parallels Service` was running with **unnecessary root privileges (CWE-250)**, the failure to verify the signature of `createinstallmedia` led to the execution of malicious code with root privileges, resulting in privilege escalation.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe analysis is strongly based on the provided evidence, specifically the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" and \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" which clearly identify the **lack of code signature verification** as the root cause. The summary highlights that the `repack_osx_install_app.sh` script did not verify the code signature of `createinstallmedia` before execution. The retriever results also suggest **CWE-347 (Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature)** as a potential match. The guidance on privileges vs. permissions further supports the choice of CWE-250, as the `Parallels Service` was running with higher privileges than necessary.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly address the root cause (**lack of code signature verification**) and a contributing factor (**unnecessary privileges**). While higher-level CWEs like CWE-345 and CWE-269 could apply, they are less specific and do not capture the full nature of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n*   **CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature**\n    *   This is the primary weakness, as the **lack of code signature verification** on `createinstallmedia` allowed the execution of malicious code. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions this **lack of verification**. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms that the `repack_osx_install_app.sh` script was not verifying the code signature of `createinstallmedia` before execution.\n    *   Security implication: Allows attackers to execute arbitrary code.\n    *   CWE-347 is a base level CWE and a child of CWE-345 (Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity), but it is more specific to cryptographic signatures.\n    *   Confidence: 0.9\n*   **CWE-250: Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**\n    *   The `Parallels Service` was running with `setuid root`, which means it had root privileges. This amplified the impact of the signature verification failure, as the malicious code was executed with root privileges.\n    *   Security implication: Increases the impact of other vulnerabilities.\n    *   CWE-250 is a base level CWE and a child of CWE-269 (Improper Privilege Management), but it is more specific as it addresses the case where code is executed with higher privileges than necessary.\n    *   Confidence: 0.7\n\nOther CWEs considered but not used:\n\n*   CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management - This is a class-level CWE, and CWE-250 is a more specific child.\n*   CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity - This is a class-level CWE, and CWE-347 is a more specific child.\n*   CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource - This CWE is more about incorrect permissions being assigned to resources, whereas this vulnerability is about code signature verification.\n*   CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition - There is no evidence of a TOCTOU race condition in the vulnerability description.\n*   CWE-427: Uncontrolled Search Path Element - There is no evidence of an uncontrolled search path element in the vulnerability description.",
