## Vulnerability Description
A **lack of code signature verification** in Parallels Desktop for Mac v19.3.0 and below allows attackers to escalate privileges via a crafted macOS installer, because Parallels Service is setuid root.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **lack of code signature verification**
- **impact:** escalate privileges
- **vector:** crafted macOS installer
- **attacker:** attackers
- **product:** Parallels Desktop for Mac
- **version:** v19.3.0 and below
- **component:** Parallels Service

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause lies in Parallels Desktop's use of a `setuid` binary, `Parallels Service`, to execute the `createinstallmedia` command as root. The `repack_osx_install_app.sh` script, responsible for handling macOS installer applications, was not verifying the code signature of `createinstallmedia` before execution. This allowed an attacker to replace the legitimate `createinstallmedia` binary within a specially crafted macOS installer app with a malicious one.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Lack of code signature verification:** The primary vulnerability was the absence of code signature verification on the `createinstallmedia` binary within the `repack_osx_install_app.sh` script before executing it as root.
- **Abuse of setuid binary:** The use of `setuid` binary `Parallels Service` that runs the vulnerable `repack_osx_install_app.sh` as root allowed the exploit to gain root privileges.
- **Trust in macOS installer structure:** Parallels Desktop was trusting the structure of macOS installer applications without proper validation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Local Privilege Escalation:** A local attacker could gain root privileges by exploiting this vulnerability.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** With root privileges, the attacker can execute any code on the affected system, potentially leading to full system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious macOS installer application containing a modified `createinstallmedia` binary.
- The attacker convinces Parallels Desktop to open the crafted application.
- `Parallels Service`, running with root privileges, executes `repack_osx_install_app.sh`.
- The script executes the malicious `createinstallmedia` without signature verification, leading to arbitrary code execution as root.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious macOS installer application.
- The attacker needs to be able to convince the user to load this application into Parallels Desktop.
- No prior root access is required, as the vulnerability provides local privilege escalation.

**Additional details:**
- This vulnerability only affects x86_64-based macOS machines because the vulnerable code path involving `createinstallmedia` is not used on Apple Silicon Macs, which use IPSW restore images.
- The vulnerability was present in Parallels Desktop versions 16.0.0 through 19.3.0 and fixed in version 19.3.1 with the addition of a code signature check for `createinstallmedia`.
- The fix implemented in version 19.3.1 verifies the code signature of `createinstallmedia` against `anchor apple` to ensure it is signed by Apple before executing it.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* 🔍 *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* 🔍 *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion – CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### 🔸 CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ✅ *“A user created with the ‘guest’ role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ✅ *“The backup service runs as root but only needs read access.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ⚠️ This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### 🔸 CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ✅ *“User can access another user’s invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.”*

## Mapping Examples – Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *“User can escalate privileges to admin.”*
> ❌ Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged – only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ✅ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**

## Good Mapping Examples – Privileges & Permissions

* ✅ **CWE-266**: *“When a new user registers, the system assigns them admin role due to a missing role validation.”*
* ✅ **CWE-250**: *“Installer runs with system-level privileges but doesn't require them to install files in the user directory.”*
* ✅ **CWE-284**: *“Inconsistent access rules between UI and backend for sensitive endpoints.”*
* ✅ **CWE-285**: *“Authorization logic fails to restrict access to finance reports based on department.”*
