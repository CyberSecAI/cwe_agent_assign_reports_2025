  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-2385 Content\n\nBased on the provided content, this report details a SQL injection vulnerability in the \"Modern Bag\" PHP application, version 1.0.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from insufficient user input validation of the \"userPassword\" parameter in the `login.php` file. Attackers can inject malicious SQL queries directly into the SQL queries without proper cleaning or validation.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   SQL Injection\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   Unauthorized database access\n*   Sensitive data leakage\n*   Data tampering\n*   Comprehensive system control\n*   Service interruption\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   The vulnerability is exploitable via a POST request to `/login.php` with a malicious payload in the `userPassword` parameter.\n*   No login or authorization is required to exploit the vulnerability.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the application.\n*   No authentication is required.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   Use prepared statements and parameter binding.\n*   Input validation and filtering.\n*   Minimize database user permissions.\n*   Regular security audits.\n\n**Additional Details (More than official CVE description):**\n\nThe report provides detailed payloads for different types of SQL injection attacks (boolean-based blind, error-based, time-based blind) and screenshots from `sqlmap` demonstrating the vulnerability. It also includes specific HTTP request examples for exploitation.\n\n**CVE Relevance:**\n\nThe content is directly related to a SQL injection vulnerability, which is a common type of vulnerability addressed by CVEs. While a CVE description was requested as a placeholder, this content provides a detailed description of a vulnerability that could be assigned a CVE ID.",

This is directly supported by the vulnerability description stating that the manipulation of the argument userEmail/userPassword leads to **sql injection**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also clearly states that the **root cause** of the vulnerability is insufficient user input validation, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL queries, which aligns perfectly with CWE-89.\n\nThe high confidence is based on the clear evidence in the vulnerability description and the CVE reference, specifically mentioning **SQL Injection** as the **weakness**.\n\nThe selection of CWE-89 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **root cause** of the vulnerability, which is the **improper neutralization** of SQL special elements.
