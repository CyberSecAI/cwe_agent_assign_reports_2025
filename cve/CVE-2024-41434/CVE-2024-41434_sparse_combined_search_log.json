This allows attackers to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) via a crafted input to the RemoveUnnecessaryFirstRow, it will check the expression between Agg and GroupBy, but does not check the return type. NOTE PingCAP disputes this, arguing that reproduction did not cause the security impact of service interruption to other users. They maintain it is a complex query bug in the product but not a DoS.",
