The CVSS score also notes that a high privileged user is required to conduct the attack.",

CWE-312 is a more specific case of CWE-522 and directly applies to the vulnerability where the private key is stored in cleartext. There aren't other relationships that are applicable.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    \n    cwe312 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe312 primary\n    class cwe522 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain involves a single step: the **incorrect** handling of the passphrase leads to the private key being stored unencrypted on disk.\n  - Root Cause: The `elasticsearch-certutil` CLI tool **fails** to encrypt the private key.\n  - Impact: The private key is stored in **cleartext**, making it accessible to unauthorized users.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis identified CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information) as the primary weakness due to the **unencrypted** storage of the private key. This aligns directly with the vulnerability description and the provided CVE reference summary. The retriever results also ranked CWE-312 as a top candidate. CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials) was considered as a broader classification, but CWE-312 was chosen for its greater specificity.\n\nThe selection is based on the following evidence:\n- **Vulnerability Description**: \"the associated private key that is generated is stored on disk **unencrypted**\"\n- **CVE Reference Links Content Summary**: \"Private key is stored **unencrypted** on disk.\"\n\nCWE-312 is the optimal level of specificity because it directly describes the root cause - the sensitive information (private key) is stored in cleartext.
