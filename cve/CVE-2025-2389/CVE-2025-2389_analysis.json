  "description": "A vulnerability was found in code-projects Blood Bank Management System 1.0. It has been rated as critical. Affected by this issue is some unknown functionality of the file /admin/add_city.php. The manipulation leads to **sql injection**. The attack may be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.",

The description indicates that the manipulation of the `/admin/add_city.php` file leads to **SQL injection**. This directly aligns with CWE-89, which describes scenarios where an application constructs an SQL command using externally influenced input without proper neutralization of special elements.\n\nThe retriever results also strongly suggest CWE-89 as the primary candidate, with a score of 1.0.\n\nThe selection of CWE-89 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **improper neutralization** of special elements in SQL commands. Other CWEs were considered but deemed less relevant because they represent broader categories (e.g., CWE-74, CWE-94) or different types of vulnerabilities (e.g., CWE-79, CWE-434).",
