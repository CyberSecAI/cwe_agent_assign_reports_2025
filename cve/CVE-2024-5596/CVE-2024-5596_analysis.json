  "description": "The ARMember Premium plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 6.7. This is due to **incorrectly implemented nonce validation function** on multiple functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify, or delete user meta and plugin options which can lead to limited privilege escalation.",

The plugin fails to properly validate the nonce, making it susceptible to CSRF attacks.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n*   Unauthenticated attackers can modify or delete user meta and plugin options.\n*   This can lead to limited privilege escalation.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n*   CSRF attacks are carried out by tricking an authenticated user into making unintended requests.\n*   An attacker could craft malicious links or HTML that, when triggered by a logged-in user, would execute actions within the ARMember plugin.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated, the vulnerability exists for unauthenticated users.\n*   The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user to click a malicious link or trigger malicious HTML, typically through social engineering or malicious websites.",
