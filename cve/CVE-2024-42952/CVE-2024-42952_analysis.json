  "description": "Tenda FH1201 v1.2.0.14 (408) was discovered to contain a **stack overflow** via the page parameter in the fromqossetting function. This vulnerability allows attackers to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) via a crafted POST request.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n\n*   A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `fromqossetting` function of the Tenda FH1201 firmware.\n\n**Vulnerabilities:**\n\n*   **Stack Overflow:** The `sprintf` function is used to construct a string using a user-supplied parameter without proper bounds checking. The statement `sprintf(v7, \"qos_list.asp?page=%s\", v4);`, where `v4` is derived from user-controlled input `page`, copies the user-provided data into a fixed-size buffer `v7`. If the size of `v4` exceeds the size of `v7`, a stack-based buffer overflow occurs.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Code Execution:** By overflowing the buffer, an attacker can overwrite adjacent data on the stack, potentially gaining arbitrary code execution on the device. This could allow the attacker to fully control the router, leading to data theft, denial of service, or other malicious activities.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a POST request to the `/goform/qossetting` endpoint.\n*   **`page` Parameter:** The malicious payload is passed via the `page` parameter of the POST request.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the Tenda router's web interface.\n*   **No Authentication Required**: The provided information doesn't mention any authentication needed for this particular request, indicating that this may be exploitable without credentials\n*  **Crafting HTTP Request:** The attacker needs to be able to craft and send an HTTP POST request with a payload large enough to cause a buffer overflow.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n*   **Affected Firmware:** The vulnerability is specifically in the Tenda FH1201 Firmware V1.2.0.14(408).\n*   **Proof of Concept:** The provided Python code demonstrates how to trigger the overflow using `requests.post` library.\n*   **Reproducibility:** The provided images show the overflow happening, and the script shows how to reproduce it, giving it a high degree of confidence.\n\nThis information gives a clear and detailed understanding of the vulnerability.",

Matches the vulnerability description and root cause evidence. |\n| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 0.8 | Base | Allowed | Secondary candidate. A more general form of the stack overflow. |\n| CWE-119 | Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer | 0.6 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary candidate. A very general description of memory corruption issues.|\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow), which is a variant of the more general CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is also related, as a stack overflow is a specific type of out-of-bounds write.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe121[\"CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    \n    cwe121 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe121 primary\n    class cwe787,cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **stack overflow** (CWE-121). This is caused by using `sprintf` without proper bounds checking when handling the `page` parameter from a POST request. This leads to an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787), which allows an attacker to overwrite adjacent data on the stack and potentially gain arbitrary code execution, leading to a denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified a **stack overflow** vulnerability in Tenda FH1201, caused by **improper** use of `sprintf` with user-controlled input. The vulnerability allows attackers to perform an out-of-bounds write, leading to a denial of service.\n\nThe evidence for the **stack overflow** is strong, based on the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" which has the **weakness** as \"**stack overflow**\" and the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" which indicates:\n*   \"A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `fromqossetting` function of the Tenda FH1201 firmware.\"\n*   \"The `sprintf` function is used to construct a string using a user-supplied parameter without proper bounds checking. The statement `sprintf(v7, \"qos_list.asp?page=%s\", v4);`, where `v4` is derived from user-controlled input `page`, copies the user-provided data into a fixed-size buffer `v7`.

CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) is too general and discouraged.\n\n**CWE Considerations:**\n\n*   **CWE-121 Stack-based Buffer Overflow:** This is the most specific and accurate CWE for this vulnerability. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions a **stack overflow**, and the root cause is the use of `sprintf` without proper bounds checking, leading to an out-of-bounds write on the stack.\n*   **CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write:** This is a valid CWE, as a stack overflow is a specific type of out-of-bounds write. However, CWE-121 is more specific and therefore preferred.\n*   **CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer:** This CWE is too general and discouraged, as it encompasses a wide range of memory corruption issues. CWE-121 and CWE-787 are more specific and provide a better description of the vulnerability.\n\nBased on the analysis, the primary CWE is CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow) with high confidence (1.0) due to the direct evidence in the vulnerability description and root cause analysis. CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is a secondary candidate with a confidence of 0.8.
