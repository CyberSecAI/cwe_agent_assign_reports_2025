  "description": "A vulnerability was found in IBPhoenix ibWebAdmin up to 1.0.2 and classified as problematic. This issue affects some unknown processing of the file /toggle_fold_panel.php of the component Tabelas Section. The manipulation of the argument p leads to **cross site scripting**. The attack may be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",

The mention of \"XSS ibWebAdmin - POC\" and a Google Docs document suggests a proof-of-concept (POC) for such an exploit. However, without more specific details from the document itself, here's the most information that can be extracted:\n\n- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The root cause is a Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability within the \"ibWebAdmin\" application.\n- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is an XSS.\n- **Impact of exploitation:** Exploitation could lead to malicious JavaScript execution within the context of a user's browser, potentially allowing attackers to steal cookies, manipulate the page, or redirect users to malicious sites.\n- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the ibWebAdmin web application. It is likely that the attacker injects malicious javascript into a web page controlled by ibWebAdmin.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to inject javascript into ibWebAdmin.\n\nThe content provides more detail than the official CVE description by indicating that the vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability specifically in the 'ibWebAdmin' application.",

        "extended_description": "\n\nThis weakness can lead to a vulnerability in environments in which the attacker does not have direct access to the operating system, such as in web applications. Alternately, if the weakness occurs in a privileged program, it could allow the attacker to specify commands that normally would not be accessible, or to call alternate commands with privileges that the attacker does not have. The problem is exacerbated if the compromised process does not follow the principle of least privilege, because the attacker-controlled commands may run with special system privileges that increases the amount of damage.\n\n\nThere are at least two subtypes of OS command injection:\n\n\n  - The application intends to execute a single, fixed program that is under its own control. It intends to use externally-supplied inputs as arguments to that program. For example, the program might use system(\"nslookup [HOSTNAME]\") to run nslookup and allow the user to supply a HOSTNAME, which is used as an argument. Attackers cannot prevent nslookup from executing. However, if the program does not remove command separators from the HOSTNAME argument, attackers could place the separators into the arguments, which allows them to execute their own program after nslookup has finished executing.\n\n  - The application accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run, as well as which commands to use. The application simply redirects this entire command to the operating system. For example, the program might use \"exec([COMMAND])\" to execute the [COMMAND] that was supplied by the user. If the COMMAND is under attacker control, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or programs. If the command is being executed using functions like exec() and CreateProcess(), the attacker might not be able to combine multiple commands together in the same line.\n\nFrom a weakness standpoint, these variants represent distinct programmer errors. In the first variant, the programmer clearly intends that input from untrusted parties will be part of the arguments in the command to be executed. In the second variant, the programmer does not intend for the command to be accessible to any untrusted party, but the programmer probably has not accounted for alternate ways in which malicious attackers can provide input.",
