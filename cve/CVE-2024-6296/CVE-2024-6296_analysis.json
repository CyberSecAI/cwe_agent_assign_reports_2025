  "description": "The Stackable - Page Builder Gutenberg Blocks plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the data-caption parameter in all versions up to, and including, 3.13.1 due to **insufficient input sanitization and output escaping**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-6296\n\n**Root Cause:**\n- Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the `data-caption` parameter within the Stackable \u2013 Page Builder Gutenberg Blocks plugin.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **DOM-Based Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The plugin doesn't properly sanitize user-supplied input (specifically the `data-caption` attribute). This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the HTML which is then stored in the database. This code is then executed when the page is viewed.\n- Lack of input sanitization on the `data-caption` attribute of image elements within the Stackable plugin.\n- Lack of output encoding for the `data-caption` attribute when rendered on the frontend.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Arbitrary code execution in the victim's browser:**  When a user views a page containing the injected malicious script, the attacker's JavaScript code will execute within the user's browser.\n- This can lead to various malicious activities such as:\n    - Session hijacking\n    - Redirecting users to malicious sites\n    - Defacing website content\n    - Stealing sensitive information.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- The vulnerability is exploited by injecting malicious JavaScript code into the `data-caption` parameter of image elements within the Stackable plugin. This data is then stored in the WordPress database.\n- When a page containing this manipulated image is viewed by any user, the injected JavaScript code executes.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n-   **Authenticated User with Contributor Level Access or Higher:** Attackers need to have at least contributor-level access to the WordPress site to be able to inject the malicious script using the vulnerable `data-caption` parameter of image elements.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The vulnerability is present in all versions of the Stackable plugin up to and including 3.13.1.\n- The vulnerability was patched in version 3.13.2 of the plugin.\n- The vulnerability is DOM-based, meaning the malicious payload is injected directly in the HTML which gets rendered on the page.\n- The fix involves sanitizing the user-supplied input and correctly encoding the output.",

While some CWEs like CWE-113 (Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers) and CWE-494 (Download of Code Without Integrity Check) have CANFOLLOW or CANPRECEDE relationships with CWE-79, these are not directly applicable to the vulnerability described.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe79 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward:\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping** (CWE-79).\n2.  **Impact:** Arbitrary web scripts injected into pages, leading to code execution in the victim's browser.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis strongly points to CWE-79 as the primary weakness. The vulnerability description explicitly states the root cause as **insufficient input sanitization and output escaping**, which directly aligns with the definition of CWE-79. The impact, arbitrary code execution, is also a typical consequence of XSS vulnerabilities.\n\nThe decision is based on the following evidence:\n\n*   \"**insufficient input sanitization and output escaping**\" directly points to CWE-79.\n*   \"inject arbitrary web scripts\" indicates XSS.\n*   The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this by stating the lack of input sanitization and output encoding on the `data-caption` attribute.\n\nThe graph relationships did not significantly influence the final decision, as CWE-79 stands as a clear root cause without needing to consider complex chains or parent-child relationships.\n\nThe selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the coding error (lack of sanitization and escaping) rather than a broader category or a specific impact.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.\n\n*Not Used:* CSRF is not applicable as the vulnerability is related to XSS, not the forging of requests.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
