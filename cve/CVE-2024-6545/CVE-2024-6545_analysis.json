  "description": "The Admin Trim Interface plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Full Path Disclosure in all versions up to, and including, 3.5.1. This is due to the plugin **utilizing bootstrap and leaving test files with display_errors on**. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve the full path of the web application, which can be used to aid other attacks. The information displayed is not useful on its own, and requires another vulnerability to be present for damage to an affected website.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the `Admin Trim Interface` plugin including test files with `display_errors` enabled, which exposes sensitive information.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n- Full Path Disclosure: The plugin's test files have `display_errors` set to `on`. When an error occurs, the server reveals the full file path of the web application.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- Information Disclosure: An unauthenticated attacker can obtain the full path of the web application.\n- Secondary Attack Vector: The exposed full path information can be used to assist in further attacks by providing the attacker with valuable information about the server's structure. It requires another vulnerability to be present for damage to an affected website.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- Unauthenticated access to a plugin's test files that has error displaying enabled can reveal the server's full file path.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- The attacker needs no authentication, simply access to the vulnerable test file with error displaying enabled.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The vulnerability is present in all versions of the `Admin Trim Interface` plugin up to and including 3.5.1.\n- A patch is not available as of the time the report was written. The recommendation is to uninstall the plugin.\n- The vulnerability was discovered by stealthcopter and publicly published on July 26, 2024.",

  "analysis": "# Summary\n| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| CWE-201 | Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship considered was the direct match of the vulnerability to CWE-201. While other CWEs like CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) appeared in the Retriever Results, they did not directly address the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the exposure of sensitive information (full path) due to error messages being displayed.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe201 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is relatively simple:\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** The **utilizing bootstrap and leaving test files with display_errors on** in the Admin Trim Interface plugin.\n2.  **Weakness:** **Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data** (CWE-201) - the full path of the web application is exposed in error messages.\n3.  **Impact:** Full Path Disclosure, which can then be used to aid other attacks.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary focus of the analysis was to identify the root cause of the vulnerability based on the provided description and supporting evidence. The vulnerability description clearly states that the plugin is **utilizing bootstrap and leaving test files with display_errors on**. This leads to the exposure of the full path of the web application.\n\nCWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data) directly addresses this issue, as it describes a scenario where code transmits data (in this case, the full path in error messages) that includes sensitive information that should not be accessible. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" further solidifies this by stating: \"The plugin's test files have `display_errors` set to `on`. When an error occurs, the server reveals the full file path of the web application.\"\n\nOther CWEs were considered, particularly those related to authorization (CWE-862, CWE-306) and file handling (CWE-23, CWE-434). However, these did not directly address the core issue of sensitive information exposure. For example, while missing authorization could potentially lead to access of these files, the vulnerability is specifically triggered by the `display_errors` setting being enabled, regardless of authorization.\n\nThe decision to map to CWE-201 is based on the clear evidence of sensitive information being exposed due to the plugin's configuration. The confidence level is high (0.9) because of the direct match between the vulnerability description and the CWE definition.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.\n\n\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-862: Missing Authorization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-178: Improper Handling of Case Sensitivity\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly account for differences in case sensitivity when accessing or determining the properties of a resource, leading to inconsistent results.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
