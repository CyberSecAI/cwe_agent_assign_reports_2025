  "description": "Gitsign is a keyless Sigstore to signing tool for Git commits with your a GitHub / OIDC identity. gitsign may select the wrong Rekor entry to use during online verification when multiple entries are returned by the log. gitsign uses Rekors search API to fetch entries that apply to a signature being verified. The parameters used for the search are the public key and the payload. The search API returns entries that match either condition rather than both. When gitsigns credential cache is used, there can be multiple entries that use the same ephemeral keypair / signing certificate. As gitsign assumes both conditions are matched by Rekor, there is no additional validation that the entrys hash matches the payload being verified, meaning that the wrong entry can be used to successfully pass verification. Impact is minimal as while gitsign does not match the payload against the entry, it does ensure that the certificate matches. This would need to be exploited during the certificate validity window (10 minutes) by the key holder.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n\n- The vulnerability stems from gitsign's incorrect assumption about how Rekor's search API works. Gitsign expects the API to return entries that match both the public key and the payload hash. However, Rekor's API returns entries matching *either* the public key or the payload hash.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n\n- **Incorrect Assumption:** Gitsign incorrectly assumes that Rekor's search API matches both the public key and the payload hash.\n- **Lack of Payload Hash Validation:** Gitsign does not perform additional validation to ensure the entry's hash matches the payload being verified. This allows the tool to select an incorrect entry with a matching key but mismatched payload.\n- **Reliance on Rekor API Order:** The exploitability depends on the order of matching entries in the response from the Rekor search API which makes triggering the vulnerability unreliable.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n- **Incorrect Verification:** An attacker could potentially use a different Rekor entry than the one intended for verification. Although, the signature will only pass verification if the certificate associated with the entry matches.\n- **Limited Scope:** The impact is considered minimal because the attacker would have to exploit the vulnerability within a short certificate validity window of 10 minutes and would need to be the holder of the signing key.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n- **Online Verification:** The vulnerability is triggered during online verification using the `gitsign verify` command or `git log --show-signature` where gitsign queries Rekor.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n- **Key Holder:** The attacker must be the key holder to generate a signature with an ephemeral keypair to exploit this vulnerability.\n- **Within Certificate Validity Window:** The exploit must occur within the 10-minute validity window of the ephemeral certificate associated with the key.\n- **Credential Cache Usage:** The gitsign credential cache must be enabled.\n- **Multiple Rekor Entries:** Multiple Rekor entries for the same keypair must exist to trigger the vulnerability.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n- The issue is dependent on the order of matching entries returned by Rekor, making the exploit less reliable and harder to reproduce consistently.\n- The vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2024-51746.\n- The fix is included in version 0.11.0 of gitsign.",

While CWE-295 (Improper Certificate Validation) is also relevant, it is more specific to certificate-related issues, whereas the core problem here is that the signature itself is not being properly validated against the payload. These are peer-level CWEs, and the choice of CWE-347 is based on the root cause.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe347[\"CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature\"]\n    cwe295[\"CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation\"]\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe347 primary\n    class cwe295 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is as follows:\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Improper validation of Rekor entries** due to an incorrect assumption about Rekor's search API and **lack of payload hash validation** (CWE-347).\n2.  **Weakness:** The system uses the wrong Rekor entry for verification, potentially leading to successful verification with an incorrect payload hash.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is primarily based on the provided vulnerability description and the summary of the CVE reference links. The key piece of evidence is that \"gitsign does not perform additional validation to ensure the entry's hash matches the payload being verified, meaning that the wrong entry can be used to successfully pass verification.\" This directly points to CWE-347, **Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature**. The retriever results also support this, with CWE-347 having the highest score.\n\nCWE-295 (Improper Certificate Validation) was considered because the description mentions certificates. However, the core issue isn't the validation of the certificate itself, but the validation of the signature against the payload using the Rekor entry. The certificate validation is performed, but the signature is not properly tied to the payload hash.\n\nTherefore, CWE-347 is at the optimal level of specificity and correctly captures the root cause of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1286: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.66\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input that is expected to be well-formed - i.e., to comply with a certain syntax - but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input complies with the syntax.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.65\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).

The end user must trust that reputable source, and this reputable source must vouch for the resource in question through the medium of the certificate.\n\n\nIn some cases, this trust traverses several entities who vouch for one another. The entity trusted by the end user is at one end of this trust chain, while the certificate-wielding resource is at the other end of the chain. If the user receives a certificate at the end of one of these trust chains and then proceeds to check only that the first link in the chain, no real trust has been derived, since the entire chain must be traversed back to a trusted source to verify the certificate.\n\n\nThere are several ways in which the chain of trust might be broken, including but not limited to:\n\n\n  - Any certificate in the chain is self-signed, unless it the root.\n\n  - Not every intermediate certificate is checked, starting from the original certificate all the way up to the root certificate.\n\n  - An intermediate, CA-signed certificate does not have the expected Basic Constraints or other important extensions.\n\n  - The root certificate has been compromised or authorized to the wrong party.\n\n",
