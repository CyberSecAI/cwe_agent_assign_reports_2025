## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Weakness:** exposure of sensitive information
- **Impact:** ['Exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized actor', 'enable information disclosure']
- **Vector:** local access
- **Attacker:** authenticated user
- **Product:** Edge Orchestrator software

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary

| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-497 | Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere | 0.8 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-200 | Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor | 0.6 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis

The primary CWE, CWE-497 [Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere], is a Base level CWE. CWE-497 is related to CWE-200 [Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor], which is a Class level CWE and a parent of CWE-497. Since the vulnerability specifically involves system information and the description specifies local access, CWE-497 is more appropriate.

## Vulnerability Chain

The vulnerability chain starts with the **exposure of sensitive system information**, leading to the **impact** of information disclosure to an unauthorized actor.

## Summary of Analysis

The initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The **weakness** is the **exposure of sensitive information**, which leads to the **impact** of information disclosure. The retriever results listed CWE-200 [Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor] as the top candidate, but it is a Class-level CWE and is generally discouraged unless a more specific CWE is not available. CWE-497 [Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere] is a Base level CWE and is more specific, as it involves the **exposure of sensitive system information**. Given the nature of the vulnerability, which involves the Edge Orchestrator software, it is reasonable to assume that the exposed information is system-related. The evidence clearly states "Exposure of sensitive information", which aligns with the characteristics of CWE-497. Therefore, CWE-497 is the primary CWE.

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.82
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-200 is commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error. As of CWE 4.9, over 400 CWE entries can lead to a loss of confidentiality. Other options are often available. [REF-1287].
