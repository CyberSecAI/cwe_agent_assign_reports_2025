CWE-787 is a more specific, base-level weakness that accurately reflects the **memory corruption** due to an **out-of-bounds write**. Therefore, CWE-787 is preferred over the more general CWE-119.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with processing a maliciously crafted video file, which leads to **memory corruption** due to an **out-of-bounds write** (CWE-787). This, in turn, can cause unexpected app termination.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description, CVE reference links, and CWE specifications. The key evidence is that processing a maliciously crafted video file may lead to unexpected app termination or **corrupt process memory**. The root cause is related to how the system handles these files, leading to **memory corruption**.\n\nThe retriever results suggest CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) as a highly relevant candidate, aligning with the **memory corruption** aspect. CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) is also considered, but it's a more general class. The vulnerability involves writing data past the boundaries of a buffer, so CWE-787 is more appropriate.\n\nThe final selection prioritizes the most specific CWE that captures the essence of the vulnerability, focusing on the **out-of-bounds write** leading to **memory corruption**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-843: Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates or initializes a resource such as a pointer, object, or variable using one type, but it later accesses that resource using a type that is incompatible with the original type.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-665: Improper Initialization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not initialize or incorrectly initializes a resource, which might leave the resource in an unexpected state when it is accessed or used.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
