# Vulnerability Description

    In sdpu_compare_uuid_with_attr of sdp_utils.cc, there is a possible **out of bounds read** due to a **heap **buffer overflow****. This could lead to remote information disclosure with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.

    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis
    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. 
    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.

    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'heap buffer overflow'

Relevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:

### 1. CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow (Score: 409.13)

A heap overflow condition is a buffer overflow, where the buffer that can be overwritten is allocated in the heap portion of memory, generally meaning that the buffer was allocated using a routine such as malloc()....

### 2. CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound (Score: 396.13)

The product performs a calculation that can
         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic
         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than
         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is
         incremented to a value that is too large to st...

### 3. CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound) (Score: 394.83)

The product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result....

### 4. CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size (Score: 388.51)

The product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow....

### 5. CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read (Score: 370.19)

The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer....
