The other relationships like CanPrecede are less relevant in this specific scenario, as we're focused on identifying the core weakness. Abstraction levels guided the selection, favoring the Base level CWE-122 for its specificity. The relationship between CWE-122 and CWE-125 is that the Heap-based Buffer Overflow can result in an Out-of-bounds Read.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe122[\"CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    \n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe122 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe125\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe122 primary\n    class cwe125 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **heap buffer overflow** (CWE-122), which leads to an **out-of-bounds read** (CWE-125), and ultimately results in remote information disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the **root cause** and the resulting **weakness**. The vulnerability description clearly states a **heap buffer overflow** leading to an **out of bounds read**.\n\nThe primary CWE, CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow), is selected because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"heap buffer overflow.\" This aligns directly with the CWE's definition: \"A heap overflow condition is a buffer overflow, where the buffer that can be overwritten is allocated in the heap portion of memory, generally meaning that the buffer was allocated using a routine such as malloc().\"\n\nThe secondary CWE, CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read), is selected because the vulnerability description also explicitly mentions \"out of bounds read\" as a consequence of the heap buffer overflow. This aligns directly with the CWE's definition: \"The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\"\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the final selection by highlighting the connection between CWE-122 and CWE-125, where the former can lead to the latter.\n\nBoth CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity (Base level), accurately representing the **root cause** and **weakness** described in the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this
