  "description": "@misskey-dev/summaly is a tool for getting a summary of a web page. Starting in version 3.0.1 and prior to version 5.2.1, a **logic error** in the main `summaly` function causes the `allowRedirects` option to never be passed to any plugins, and as a result, isnt enforced. Misskey will follow redirects, despite explicitly requesting not to. Version 5.2.1 contains a patch for the issue.",

Verification:**\n\nThe content directly relates to CVE-2025-46553 as indicated by the \"CVE ID\" section. It details a vulnerability advisory for the `@misskey-dev/summaly` package.\n\n**2. Extracted Information:**\n\n*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** A logic error in the `summaly` function prevents the `allowRedirects` option from being passed to plugins, effectively bypassing the intended redirect control.\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CWE-664 - Improper Restriction of Path-Based Resource Access. (Although the description doesn't directly mention path access, the bypass of redirect control can lead to accessing unintended resources.)\n*   **Impact of exploitation:** Misskey will follow redirects even when explicitly configured not to.\n*   **Attack vectors:** Publishing a post containing a link to a URL that redirects on Misskey.\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to publish a post on Misskey containing a redirecting link. This requires a Misskey account.\n*   **Mitigation or fix:**  The vulnerability is patched in version 5.2.1 of the `@misskey-dev/summaly` package.\n*   **Severity:** Low (CVSS score of 0.0/10)\n*   **CVSS v3 base metrics:**\n    *   Attack Vector: Network\n    *   Attack Complexity: Low\n    *   Privileges Required: None\n    *   User Interaction: Required\n    *   Scope: Unchanged\n    *   Confidentiality: None\n    *   Integrity: None\n    *   Availability: None\n\n**3. Additional Details:**\n\nThe provided content offers more detail than the placeholder CVE description. It includes:\n\n*   Specific package and affected versions.\n*   A Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrating the vulnerability.\n*   CVSS scoring and metrics.\n*   Credits to the vulnerability finder.",

While it is more general, it captures the essence of the resource consumption issue due to uncontrolled redirects. CWE-601 is a more specific Base CWE representing the impact of the vulnerability (open redirect). The relationship is that **Improper Control of Resource Consumption** leads to an **Open Redirect**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe664[\"CWE-664: Improper Control of Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe601[\"CWE-601: URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')\"]\n\n    cwe601 -->|CANRESULTIN| cwe664\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe664 primary\n    class cwe601 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **logic error** in the `summaly` function, which leads to the `allowRedirects` option not being enforced. This **missing enforcement** allows the system to follow redirects even when it should not, resulting in a potential **URL Redirection to an Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')**, and by extension **Improper Control of Resource Consumption**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nInitially, I considered the retriever results, especially CWE-601 and CWE-863. However, the **root cause** is not directly related to authorization but rather the **improper control** over whether redirects are allowed, which ties into resource consumption and potentially unintended access. Therefore, I chose CWE-664 as the primary CWE because it describes the **improper control** leading to excessive resource usage. CWE-601 is a secondary CWE describing the impact.\n\nThe evidence supporting my decision is the vulnerability description highlighting the **logic error** and the CVE reference summary stating that the vulnerability allows Misskey to follow redirects even when explicitly requested not to.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-664 as a class to represent the root cause of resource control issues and CWE-601 as a base to represent the resulting open redirect.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
