  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved sched_ext Fix pick_task_scx() picking non-queued tasks when its called without balance() a6250aa251ea (sched_ext Handle cases where pick_task_scx() is called without preceding balance_scx()) added a workaround to handle the cases where pick_task_scx() is called without prececing balance_scx() which is due to a fair class bug where pick_taks_fair() may return NULL after a true return from balance_fair(). The workaround detects when pick_task_scx() is called without preceding balance_scx() and emulates SCX_RQ_BAL_KEEP and triggers kicking to avoid stalling. Unfortunately, the workaround code was testing whether @prev was on SCX to decide whether to keep the task running. This is incorrect as the task may be on SCX but no longer runnable. This could lead to a **non-runnable task to be returned from pick_task_scx()** which cause interesting confusions and failures. e.g. A common failure mode is the task ending up with (!on_rq && on_cpu) state which can cause potential wakers to busy loop, which can easily lead to deadlocks. Fix it by testing whether @prev has SCX_TASK_QUEUED set. This makes @prev_on_scx only used in one place. Open code the usage and improve the comment while at it.",

This leads to `pick_task_scx()` being called without `balance_scx()`, which is handled by a workaround. However, the workaround **incorrectly tests** whether `@prev` was on SCX, leading to a **non-runnable task** being returned. This state (`!on_rq && on_cpu`) can cause potential wakers to busy loop, eventually resulting in a **deadlock**.\n\nThe primary root cause is the incorrect test condition in the workaround. The impact is a deadlock.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial assessment considered several CWEs, particularly those related to race conditions and resource management. However, the key aspect of the vulnerability is that it can easily lead to **deadlocks**. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions this outcome: \"A common failure mode is the task ending up with (!on_rq && on_cpu) state which can cause potential wakers to busy loop, which can easily lead to deadlocks.\"\n\nThe **weakness**, a **non-runnable task to be returned from pick_task_scx()**, leads to a deadlock. While a race condition (CWE-362) is present, the ultimate and most severe outcome is a deadlock (CWE-833). Therefore, CWE-833 is selected as the primary CWE. The concurrency aspects are represented by CWE-362 as a secondary factor.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly reflect the **root cause** (incorrect test leading to non-runnable task) and the final impact (deadlock).\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not Selected:* Improper Locking (CWE-667) isn't the direct issue, although locking could be involved in preventing the race condition and deadlock.\n\n## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Selected as Secondary:* Although deadlock is the ultimate issue, the race condition is a contributing factor.\n\n## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check.
