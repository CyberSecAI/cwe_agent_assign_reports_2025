CWE-611, **Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference**, is also applicable because the vulnerability description mentions an **XML External Entity (XXE)** vulnerability. While CWE-611 is broader, CWE-776 is more specific to the root cause of the vulnerability, namely the recursive entity references leading to XML entity expansion, and is thus selected as the primary CWE. Both are at the Base level of abstraction.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe776[\"CWE-776: Improper Restriction of Recursive Entity References in DTDs ('XML Entity Expansion')\"]\n    cwe611[\"CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference\"]\n\n    cwe776 -->|PEEROF| cwe611\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe776 primary\n    class cwe611 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper restriction of recursive entity references in DTDs**, leading to **XML entity expansion** (CWE-776). This leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition due to excessive resource consumption. An attacker can exploit this by sending a crafted XML payload. The impact is DoS and potential information retrieval.\n  - **Root Cause:** CWE-776 - Improper Restriction of Recursive Entity References in DTDs ('XML Entity Expansion')\n  - **Secondary Weakness:** CWE-611 - Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference\n  - **Impact:** Denial of Service\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary, which explicitly mentions the root cause as \"Improper restriction of recursive entity references in DTDs leading to XML entity expansion\" and lists CWE-776 as a weakness. The vulnerability description also mentions \"XML External Entity (XXE)\" vulnerability, which maps to CWE-611.\n\nThe relationship analysis shows that CWE-776 and CWE-611 are related, but CWE-776 is more specific to the root cause. The retriever results also list CWE-611 and CWE-776 as potential candidates, but CWE-611 has a slightly higher similarity score. However, considering the detailed root cause description in the CVE reference, CWE-776 is selected as the primary CWE. Both CWEs are at the Base level of abstraction, which is the preferred level.\n\nThe selection of CWE-776 is strongly supported by the evidence and aligns with the mapping guidance, making it the most appropriate classification for the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
