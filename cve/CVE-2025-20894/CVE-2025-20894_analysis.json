CWE-284, a Pillar-level CWE, was considered but deemed too general. CWE-1263 more accurately reflects the physical access component of the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1263[\"CWE-1263: Improper Physical Access Control\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe1263 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1263 primary\n    class cwe284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper access control**, specifically a flaw in physical access control. This allows a physical attacker to access data across multiple user profiles.\n\nRoot Cause: **Improper access control** leading to unauthorized access.\nImpact: Access to data across multiple user profiles.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description explicitly states \"**Improper access control**\" as the root cause, making it a key factor in the CWE selection. The Retriever Results suggest several CWEs related to authorization and access control. However, given that the attack vector is physical, CWE-1263 (Improper Physical Access Control) is the most appropriate primary CWE.\n\nCWE-284 (Improper Access Control) is a broader category and could be considered as a secondary CWE. However, choosing CWE-1263 provides a more specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability.\n\nThe provided evidence from the vulnerability description is: \"**Improper access control** in Samsung Email prior to version 6.1.97.1 allows physical attackers to access data across multiple user profiles.\"\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly address the **improper access control** issue that allows physical attackers to access data across multiple user profiles.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
