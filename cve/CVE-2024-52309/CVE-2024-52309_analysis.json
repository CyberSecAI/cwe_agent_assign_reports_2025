  "description": "SFTPGo is a full-featured and highly configurable SFTP, HTTP/S, FTP/S and WebDAV server - S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob. One powerful feature of SFTPGo is the ability to have the EventManager execute scripts or run applications in response to certain events. This feature is very common in all software similar to SFTPGo and is generally unrestricted. However, any SFTPGo administrator with permission to run a script has access to the underlying OS/container with the same permissions as the user running SFTPGo. This is unexpected for some SFTPGo administrators who think that there is a clear distinction between accessing the system shell and accessing the SFTPGo WebAdmin UI. To avoid this confusion, running system commands is disabled by default in 2.6.3, and an allow list has been added so that system administrators configuring SFTPGo must explicitly define which commands are allowed to be configured from the WebAdmin UI.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2024-52309:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\n- The vulnerability stems from the unrestricted ability of the SFTPGo EventManager to execute system commands.\n-  Prior to the fix, any SFTPGo administrator with the permission to configure event-triggered scripts could execute arbitrary system commands with the same privileges as the SFTPGo process, potentially gaining access to the underlying OS, database, and server configurations. This was due to the lack of restrictions on which commands could be executed.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n- **Unrestricted Command Execution:** The primary weakness is that the EventManager did not have any restrictions on the system commands it could execute.\n- **Lack of Privilege Separation:** SFTPGo administrators with web UI access had the potential to gain OS-level access through the EventManager, blurring the expected separation of privileges.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n- **System Compromise:** An attacker (SFTPGo admin) could execute arbitrary commands on the underlying OS, potentially leading to a full system compromise.\n- **Data Breach:** By accessing the OS and database, attackers could potentially steal sensitive information from the SFTPGo instance or connected systems.\n- **Configuration Tampering:** Attackers could modify server configurations, leading to denial of service or other malicious outcomes.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n- **SFTPGo WebAdmin UI:** The vulnerability is exploited through the EventManager configuration in the SFTPGo web administration interface.\n- **Event-Triggered Actions:** Attackers would configure event actions to execute arbitrary system commands.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n- **SFTPGo Administrator Access:** The attacker needs to have administrative privileges to configure event actions through the SFTPGo web interface.\n\n**Mitigation:**\n\n- The vulnerability was patched by:\n  - **Disabling command execution by default**: System commands execution is disabled by default.\n  - **Implementing an allow list:**  The fix introduces an allow list for system commands. Administrators now have to explicitly specify which commands are allowed in the configurations.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n- The provided content includes commit details ([88b1850](https://github.com/drakkan/sftpgo/commit/88b1850b5806eee81150873d4e565144b21021fb) and [b524da1](https://github.com/drakkan/sftpgo/commit/b524da11e9466d05fe03304713ee1c61bb276ec4)) which demonstrate the code changes made to address this vulnerability.\n- The advisory highlights the confusion that could arise from administrators assuming that web UI access was separate from shell access.\n- The fix ensures that administrators are aware of the implications of configuring event-triggered actions, as they need to explicitly define the commands that are allowed.",

Also, CWE-78 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command) is related to the impact of the vulnerability, where arbitrary commands can be executed.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe266[\"CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\"]\n    cwe269[\"CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management\"]\n    cwe250[\"CWE-250: Execution with Unnecessary Privileges\"]\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command\"]\n    \n    cwe266 -->|CHILDOF| cwe269\n    cwe78 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe266\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe266 primary\n    class cwe269,cwe250,cwe78 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **Incorrect Privilege Assignment** (CWE-266), allowing an administrator with web UI access to execute system commands. This leads to **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges** (CWE-250), as the administrator's privileges are broader than intended. Finally, this could lead to **Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')** (CWE-78), where an attacker could inject malicious commands.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis indicated that the root cause was related to privilege management. The primary CWE, CWE-266, was selected because it accurately represents the vulnerability where SFTPGo administrators with web UI access were incorrectly granted privileges to execute arbitrary system commands, leading to potential OS compromise.\n\nThe evidence for CWE-266 is found in the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section: \"**rootcause:** **unrestricted access to underlying OS/container**\" and in the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section: \"The vulnerability stems from the unrestricted ability of the SFTPGo EventManager to execute system commands.\"\n\nThe selection of CWE-266 is at the optimal level of specificity because it focuses on the incorrect assignment of privileges rather than a more general improper privilege management issue (CWE-269).\n\nCWE-250 (Execution with Unnecessary Privileges) was considered because the administrator with web UI access had privileges that were too broad, allowing them to execute system commands. However, CWE-266 was deemed more relevant as it directly addresses the incorrect assignment of these privileges.\n\nCWE-78 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command) was considered because the vulnerability could potentially lead to OS command injection. However, it was not selected as the primary CWE because the root cause is the incorrect privilege assignment, not the injection itself.\nCWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) was considered, but the problem isn't that authorization checks are in place and incorrect, but rather the initial privilege assignment is flawed.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
