  "vulnerabilities": [
    {
      "rootCause": "Two bugs in the MOV demuxer of tsMuxer. The first bug is a heap buffer \"over-parse\" in `mov_read_stsd()`, where the size of an atom is calculated based on user input without proper validation against the actual atom size, leading to parsing of subsequent atoms as children of the stsd atom. The second bug is in `mov_read_ctts()` where the `ctts_count` is not initialized, leading to a heap buffer overflow in subsequent calls to `mov_read_trun()` when writing to `ctts_data` vector.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Heap buffer overflow",
        "Incorrect input validation",
        "Out-of-bounds write"
      ],
       "impact": "The heap buffer overflow has the potential to be exploited for arbitrary code execution, potentially leading to a reverse shell.",
      "attackVectors": [
        "Maliciously crafted MOV file"
      ],
      "requiredCapabilities": "An attacker needs to provide a crafted MOV file to tsMuxer. The vulnerability occurs during file parsing, so no special privileges or network access are needed by the attacker.",
       "additionalDetails": "The \"over-parse\" vulnerability in `mov_read_stsd()` makes it easier for the second heap buffer overflow in `mov_read_trun()` to be triggered by parsing additional atoms.  The exploit leverages the heap buffer overflow to overwrite the `ctts_data` vector's metadata and create an arbitrary-address-write primitive, further used to achieve remote code execution using FSOP."
