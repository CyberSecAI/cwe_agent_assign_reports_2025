## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-0699 related content

The provided content is directly related to a SQL injection vulnerability in the "bootplus" application. It provides more detail than a typical CVE description would.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The `queryListByPage` method in `src/main/java/io/github/service/impl/SysRoleServiceImpl.java` does not filter the `sort` value passed to it.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   SQL Injection

**Impact of exploitation:**

The impact is not explicitly stated, but SQL injection vulnerabilities can allow attackers to:
*   Read sensitive data from the database.
*   Modify data in the database.
*   Execute arbitrary commands on the database server.

**Attack vectors:**

The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the `sort` parameter in a request to `/admin/sys/role/list`. The example provided demonstrates using `extractvalue` within the `sort` parameter to potentially extract user information.

Example malicious URL:

```
http://192.168.0.105:8080/admin/sys/role/list?sort=createTime%20asc,extractvalue(1,concat(0x5c,user(),0x5c))&order=&offset=0&limit=20
```

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
*   The attacker needs to understand SQL injection techniques.
*   Network access to the application.

**Mitigation or fix:**

The content does not provide a specific fix, but the root cause indicates that proper input validation and sanitization of the `sort` parameter are required to prevent SQL injection.  Specifically, filtering or escaping special characters in the `sort` parameter before using it in the SQL query.
