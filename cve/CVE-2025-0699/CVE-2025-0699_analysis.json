  "description": "A vulnerability was found in JoeyBling bootplus up to 247d5f6c209be1a5cf10cd0fa18e1d8cc63cf55d. It has been declared as critical. Affected by this vulnerability is an unknown functionality of the file /admin/sys/role/list. The manipulation of the argument sort leads to **sql injection**. The attack can be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. This product does not use versioning. This is why information about affected and unaffected releases are unavailable.",

  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-0699 related content\n\nThe provided content is directly related to a SQL injection vulnerability in the \"bootplus\" application. It provides more detail than a typical CVE description would.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe `queryListByPage` method in `src/main/java/io/github/service/impl/SysRoleServiceImpl.java` does not filter the `sort` value passed to it.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   SQL Injection\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nThe impact is not explicitly stated, but SQL injection vulnerabilities can allow attackers to:\n*   Read sensitive data from the database.\n*   Modify data in the database.\n*   Execute arbitrary commands on the database server.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\nThe vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the `sort` parameter in a request to `/admin/sys/role/list`. The example provided demonstrates using `extractvalue` within the `sort` parameter to potentially extract user information.\n\nExample malicious URL:\n\n```\nhttp://192.168.0.105:8080/admin/sys/role/list?sort=createTime%20asc,extractvalue(1,concat(0x5c,user(),0x5c))&order=&offset=0&limit=20\n```\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   An attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.\n*   The attacker needs to understand SQL injection techniques.\n*   Network access to the application.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\nThe content does not provide a specific fix, but the root cause indicates that proper input validation and sanitization of the `sort` parameter are required to prevent SQL injection.  Specifically, filtering or escaping special characters in the `sort` parameter before using it in the SQL query.",

The **SQL injection** vulnerability is directly caused by **improper neutralization** of special elements in the `sort` parameter.|\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship influencing the decision is the direct match of the vulnerability description to the CWE-89 description. The other CWEs listed were related to potential consequences or tangential issues, but CWE-89 directly addresses the root cause of the **SQL injection**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe89 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain consists of the following:\n1.  The application receives input from the `sort` parameter.\n2.  The application fails to neutralize special elements in the `sort` parameter, leading to **SQL injection** (**CWE-89**).\n3.  An attacker can then read sensitive data, modify data, or execute arbitrary commands on the database server.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based heavily on the explicit description of an **SQL injection** vulnerability due to the **improper neutralization** of the `sort` parameter, as stated in the \"Vulnerability Description\" and confirmed by the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\".\n\nThe **SQL injection** vulnerability is a direct consequence of **improper neutralization** of the `sort` parameter, making CWE-89 the most specific and accurate classification.
