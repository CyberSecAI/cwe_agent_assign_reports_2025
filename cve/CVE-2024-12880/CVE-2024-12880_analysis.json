  "description": "A vulnerability in infiniflow/ragflow version RAGFlow-0.13.0 allows for partial account takeover via **insecure data querying**. The issue arises from the way tenant IDs are handled in the application. If a user has access to multiple tenants, they can manipulate their tenant access to query and access API tokens of other tenants. This vulnerability affects the following endpoints /v1/system/token_list, /v1/system/new_token, /v1/api/token_list, /v1/api/new_token, and /v1/api/rm. An attacker can exploit this to access other tenants API tokens, perform actions on behalf of other tenants, and access their data.",

The vulnerability allows a user to bypass authorization by manipulating a key (tenant ID) they control to access resources of other tenants. |\n| CWE-668 | Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere | 0.7 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary Candidate. This CWE is relevant because the vulnerability results in the exposure of API tokens to the wrong control sphere (other tenants), but CWE-639 is a more specific root cause. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship that influences the decision is that CWE-639 \"Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\" is at the Base level of abstraction, which is preferred. CWE-668 \"Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\" is a Class level CWE and is more general. CWE-639 can lead to CWE-668.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n\n    cwe639 -->|CAN_LEAD_TO| cwe668\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe639 primary\n    class cwe668 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **insecure data querying** due to the **improper handling of tenant IDs**, which leads to an authorization bypass, and ultimately results in partial account takeover and exposure of API tokens.\n\n*   Root Cause: **Insecure data querying** (manifested as **improper handling of tenant IDs**), represented by CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key).\n*   Impact: Partial account takeover and exposure of API tokens, which can be represented by CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is the **insecure data querying** that allows users to manipulate tenant IDs to bypass authorization and access other tenants' API tokens. This aligns well with CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key), which describes a scenario where authorization is bypassed by modifying a user-controlled key. The \"Retriever Results\" also lists CWE-639 as the top candidate.\n\nCWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere) is a secondary candidate because the vulnerability leads to the exposure of sensitive information (API tokens) to unauthorized actors (other tenants). However, it is a more general CWE and doesn't capture the specific root cause of the vulnerability, which is the authorization bypass through user-controlled key manipulation.\n\nThe selection of CWE-639 is based on the explicit mention of manipulating tenant access to query and access API tokens of other tenants, which directly relates to the concept of bypassing authorization using a user-controlled key. This aligns with the CWE's description and mapping guidance, which recommends using Base-level CWEs for root cause analysis.\n\nOther CWEs Considered but Not Used:\n\n*   CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization): While the vulnerability involves authorization, CWE-639 is more specific in that it highlights the mechanism of the bypass (user-controlled key).\n*   CWE-285 (Improper Authorization): Similar to CWE-863, this is a broader category and doesn't capture the specific details of the vulnerability.\n*   CWE-425 (Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')): Not applicable as the issue is not direct requests but rather manipulating existing access to gain further access.\n*   CWE-22 (Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')): Not applicable as the issue is not path traversal.\n*   CWE-94 (Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')): Not applicable as the issue is not code injection.\n*   CWE-532 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File): Not applicable as the issue is not the logging of sensitive information.\n*   CWE-613 (Insufficient Session Expiration): Not applicable as the issue is not session expiration.\n*   CWE-471 (Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID)): Not applicable as the issue is not modification of data.\n*   CWE-73 (External Control of File Name or Path): Not applicable as the issue is not file name or path control.\n*   CWE-98 (Improper Control of Filename for Include/Require Statement in PHP Program ('PHP Remote File Inclusion')): Not applicable as the issue is not PHP file inclusion.",
