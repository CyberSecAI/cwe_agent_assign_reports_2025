  "description": "Nextcloud Server is a self hosted personal cloud system. Due to a pre-flighted HEAD request, the link reference provider could be tricked into downloading bigger websites than intended, to find open-graph data. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server is upgraded to 28.0.10 or 29.0.7 and Nextcloud Enterprise Server is upgraded to 27.1.11.8, 28.0.10 or 29.0.7.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-52520\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability lies in the `LinkReferenceProvider` of Nextcloud. It relies on a HEAD request to determine the size of a linked resource before downloading it to extract open graph data. However, the HEAD request can be manipulated to report a small size, while the subsequent GET request returns a much larger file. This allows the provider to be tricked into downloading files larger than the intended limit.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- Inadequate size check: The `LinkReferenceProvider` relies on the `Content-Length` header from a HEAD request which is not reliable.\n- Lack of proper stream handling: The initial size check was done only on the HEAD request, not on the body of the GET request.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- Denial of Service (DoS): An attacker can cause the Nextcloud server to download large files, potentially consuming excessive bandwidth and resources, leading to a denial-of-service condition.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- Network: The attack is carried out over the network by providing manipulated links to the Nextcloud instance.\n- The vulnerability is triggered when Nextcloud attempts to resolve a link for Open Graph data.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- The attacker needs to be able to provide or control links that a Nextcloud user will interact with.\n- The attacker needs to be able to host files on a server.\n- The attacker needs a basic understanding of HTTP requests and headers.\n- The attacker needs to provide a manipulated response to a HEAD request so that the GET request is initiated.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n- The fix implemented reads the response body as a stream and checks the size during the reading process to ensure that the limit isn't exceeded, rather than relying on the HEAD request.\n- The fix also includes a timeout for the get request.\n- The vulnerability has been assigned a \"Moderate\" severity with a CVSS score of 5.7\n- The vulnerability is addressed in Nextcloud Server versions 28.0.10, 29.0.7 and Nextcloud Enterprise Server versions 27.1.11.8, 28.0.10, and 29.0.7.\n- A workaround is to disable the `'reference_opengraph'` setting in the `config.php` file.",

The Nextcloud server consumes excessive bandwidth and resources due to downloading large files. |\n| CWE-1333 | Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary candidate. The link reference provider downloads bigger websites than intended, to find open-graph data. |\n| CWE-918 | Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) | 0.4 | Base | Allowed | Secondary candidate. The web server receives a URL from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-400, which represents the uncontrolled consumption of resources, specifically bandwidth and memory. CWE-1333 is considered as a contributing factor if the open-graph data extraction involves complex regex operations, thus exacerbating the resource consumption. CWE-918 is considered since the server is fetching external content without proper validation.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe1333[\"CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\"]\n    cwe918[\"CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)\"]\n    \n    cwe1333 -->|CAN_CONTRIBUTE| cwe400\n    cwe918 -->|CAN_CONTRIBUTE| cwe400\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe400 primary\n    class cwe1333,cwe918 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the Nextcloud server's **failure to properly validate the size of the linked resource** based on the HEAD request, which leads to downloading large files. This **uncontrolled resource consumption** can result in a denial-of-service condition. If the vulnerability were due to inefficient processing (regex) during data extraction, then CWE-1333 would be part of the chain. If Nextcloud is fetching external content without proper validation, then CWE-918 would be part of the chain.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is **uncontrolled resource consumption** (CWE-400) due to the **lack of proper size validation** of downloaded resources. The vulnerability description explicitly states that the link reference provider can be tricked into downloading bigger websites than intended, leading to excessive bandwidth and resource consumption.\n\nThe evidence supporting CWE-400 is: \"the link reference provider could be tricked into downloading bigger websites than intended\" and \"An attacker can cause the Nextcloud server to download large files, potentially consuming excessive bandwidth and resources, leading to a denial-of-service condition.\"\n\nThe retriever results listed several CWEs related to sensitive information, such as CWE-209, CWE-532, and CWE-201, however, these are not relevant to the **root cause** of this vulnerability, which is the excessive consumption of resources.\n\nCWE-918 was considered because the Nextcloud server is fetching external content. However, the primary issue is not the forgery of requests, but the **lack of proper validation of the size of the resource**, which leads to resource exhaustion. Therefore, CWE-400 is a more direct representation of the vulnerability.\n\nCWE-1333 was considered because the link reference provider downloads bigger websites than intended, to find open-graph data. This could involve inefficient regex operations, thus exacerbating the resource consumption.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the base level of abstraction, providing a specific and accurate representation of the vulnerabilities.",
