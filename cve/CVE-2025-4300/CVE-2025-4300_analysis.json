Here's the extracted information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\n*   A SQL injection vulnerability was found in the '/search\\_list.php' file of the 'Content Management System' project. The reason for this issue is that attackers inject malicious code from the parameter 'search' and use it directly in SQL queries without the need for appropriate cleaning or validation.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   SQL injection\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   Attackers can exploit this SQL injection vulnerability to achieve unauthorized database access, sensitive data leakage, data tampering, comprehensive system control, and even service interruption.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   The '/search\\_list.php' file is vulnerable via the 'search' parameter.\n*   No login or authorization is required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   An attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP POST requests to the `/search_list.php` endpoint.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   Use prepared statements and parameter binding.\n*   Input validation and filtering.\n*   Minimize database user permissions.\n*   Regular security audits.\n\n**Payload Examples:**\n\nThe content provides several payload examples for different SQL injection techniques:\n\n*   **boolean-based blind:** `search=1') AND EXTRACTVALUE(3327,CASE WHEN (3327=3327) THEN 3327 ELSE 0x3A END)-- Pybi`\n*   **error-based:** `search=1') AND GTID_SUBSET(CONCAT(0x7171626271,(SELECT (ELT(1317=1317,1))),0x71627a6271),1317)-- eJyc`\n*   **time-based blind:** `search=1') AND (SELECT 1155 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))xJFK)-- GAGY`\n*   **UNION query:** `search=1') UNION ALL SELECT NULL,NULL,CONCAT(0x7171626271,0x4d47545a62504e626a424a574d504f6b59654e466d714d6d4d78537456556c7969634a4c5a484e58,0x71627a6271),NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL#`\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\nThis content provides significantly more detail than a typical CVE description, including specific payloads and mitigation steps.

There are no clear parent-child relationships immediately relevant, although CWE-89 is a child of CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')). The vulnerability description clearly points to SQL injection as the root cause, making CWE-89 the most specific and appropriate choice.

The provided payloads confirm the SQL injection vulnerability. The retriever results also list CWE-89 as the top candidate. The final decision is based on the clear evidence of SQL injection, making CWE-89 the most appropriate and specific classification.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-96: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Statically Saved Code ('Static Code Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes code syntax before inserting the input into an executable resource, such as a library, configuration file, or template.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.
