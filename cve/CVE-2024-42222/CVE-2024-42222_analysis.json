  "description": "In Apache CloudStack 4.19.1.0, a **regression in the network listing API** allows unauthorised list access of network details for domain admin and normal user accounts. This vulnerability compromises tenant isolation, potentially leading to unauthorised access to network details, configurations and data. Affected users are advised to upgrade to version 4.19.1.1 to address this issue. Users on older versions of CloudStack considering to upgrade, can skip 4.19.1.0 and upgrade directly to 4.19.1.1.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-42222:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nA regression in the network listing API within Apache CloudStack 4.19.1.0.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n-  **Unauthorised Access:** The network listing API allows domain admins and normal users to access network details that do not belong to their domain.\n- **Tenant Isolation Breach:** This unauthorized access compromises tenant isolation within the cloud environment.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Unauthorised access to network details:** Attackers can gain access to sensitive network details, configurations, and data. This can lead to further attacks if the attacker can glean sensitive information from the configurations.\n- **Compromised tenant isolation**: Tenant isolation is compromised which can lead to further lateral movements within the cloud infrastructure.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- The vulnerability is accessible through the network listing API.\n- An attacker would need valid credentials to log into the CloudStack UI or API.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- The attacker needs to be a domain admin or a normal user account within an Apache CloudStack 4.19.1.0 environment.\n- The attacker needs to be able to log into the CloudStack UI or utilize the API.\n\n**Additional details:**\n\n*   The issue is specific to Apache CloudStack version 4.19.1.0.\n*   The vulnerability was introduced as a regression.\n*   The issue was fixed in version 4.19.1.1.\n*   Users of versions prior to 4.19.1.0 are recommended to upgrade directly to 4.19.1.1.\n*   The vulnerability allows domain admins to view networks belonging to other domains. It was initially reported that normal users were not affected, but further investigation revealed that normal users could also see other domain networks by using the \"shared\" filter.\n\nThis analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the vulnerability based on the given information, which goes into more detail than the basic CVE description.",

While it would be ideal to have a more specific Base-level CWE, the description directly indicates an authorization problem, making this a reasonable starting point. CWE-200 (**Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor**) is considered as a secondary candidate because the impact of the **incorrect authorization** leads to the exposure of sensitive network details. However, CWE-200 is discouraged as it represents the impact rather than the root cause. There's no clear parent-child or chain relationship influencing the primary selection, but the relationship between authorization and information exposure is evident.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe200 -->|RESULT_OF| cwe863\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **regression in the network listing API** which leads to **incorrect authorization**, ultimately resulting in **unauthorised access of network details** and a compromise of **tenant isolation**.\n\n*   **Root Cause:** **Regression in the network listing API** leading to a failure in authorization checks (CWE-863).\n*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information (CWE-200) and compromised tenant isolation.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability based on the provided evidence. The key phrase \"**regression in the network listing API**\" coupled with the statement that it \"allows unauthorised list access of network details\" pointed towards an authorization issue.\n\nThe description states: \"In Apache CloudStack 4.19.1.0, a **regression in the network listing API** allows unauthorised list access of network details for domain admin and normal user accounts.

The **regression** introduced a flaw where the authorization mechanism failed to properly restrict access to network details based on the user's domain. This aligns with the definition of CWE-863, \"The product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.\"\n\nCWE-200 (**Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor**) was considered because the impact of the **incorrect authorization** is the exposure of sensitive network details. However, it's a secondary effect, and CWE-200 is discouraged for root cause analysis.\n\nThe selection of CWE-863 is at the Class level, and while a more specific Base-level CWE would be preferable, the current evidence sufficiently supports this classification.\nThe retriever results also pointed to other exposure related CWEs as well, but were discarded since they represent the impact of the root cause.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 973.54\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-200 is commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error.
