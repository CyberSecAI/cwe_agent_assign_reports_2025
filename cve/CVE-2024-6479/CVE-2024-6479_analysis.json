  "description": "The SIP Reviews Shortcode for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the no_of_reviews attribute in the woocommerce_reviews shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.3 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.",

While CWE-943 is a class-level CWE that encompasses SQL injection, LDAP injection, and other data query injection vulnerabilities, CWE-89 is a base-level CWE that specifically addresses SQL injection. Given the vulnerability description explicitly mentions SQL injection, CWE-89 is the more specific and appropriate choice.
