  "reference_content": "## SQL Injection Vulnerability in /ffos/admin/menus/view_menu.php\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe application does not properly sanitize user input for the `id` parameter in the URL `/ffos/admin/menus/view_menu.php?id=<id>`. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   SQL Injection\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nSuccessful exploitation allows an attacker to potentially:\n\n*   Retrieve sensitive database information, including the database version (demonstrated in the PoC).\n*   Modify or delete data in the database.\n*   Potentially gain unauthorized access to the system.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   HTTP request manipulation: Modifying the `id` parameter in the URL `/ffos/admin/menus/view_menu.php?id=<id>` with a crafted SQL injection payload.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   Authenticated as an administrator (username: admin, password: admin123).\n*   Ability to craft a malicious SQL query.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   Implement parameterized queries or prepared statements to separate SQL code from user input.\n*   Input validation and sanitization: Validate and sanitize the `id` parameter to ensure it only contains expected characters (e.g., integers).\n*   Least privilege principle: Ensure the database user used by the application has only the necessary permissions.\n\n**Payload Example:**\n\n`http://localhost/ffos/admin/menus/view_menu.php?id=xxx'+union+select+1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,group_concat(\"result:+\",version())--+-`\n\nThis payload retrieves the database version.\n\n**Note:** This content provides more detail than a typical CVE description, including a proof of concept and specific payload example.",

The application fails to neutralize special elements in SQL commands, leading to SQL injection. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship that influenced the decision was the direct match of the vulnerability description to the definition and examples provided for CWE-89. The retriever results strongly support this. The other CWEs were considered but deemed less relevant as they address different types of weaknesses (e.g., Cross-Site Scripting, Unrestricted File Upload).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe89 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper sanitization** of the `id` parameter, leading to the **SQL Injection** vulnerability, which can then lead to the **retrieval of sensitive data**, **modification of data**, or **unauthorized access**. The root cause is the lack of proper input validation/sanitization before constructing the SQL query.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the vulnerability description, which explicitly states that the manipulation of the `ID` argument leads to **SQL Injection**. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms this by stating that the application **does not properly sanitize** user input for the `id` parameter. This confirms that the **root cause** is **improper neutralization** of special elements in an SQL command (CWE-89).\n\nThe retriever results also strongly suggest CWE-89 as the best match. Other CWEs were considered, but they were not as directly relevant as CWE-89. For example, CWE-79 (Cross-Site Scripting) addresses a different type of injection, and CWE-434 (Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type) relates to file uploads, neither of which are described in this vulnerability.\n\nThe selection of CWE-89 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **improper neutralization** of SQL special elements.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it **does not neutralize** or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.

pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product **allows

of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it **does not neutralize** or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-472:

sending it to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more
