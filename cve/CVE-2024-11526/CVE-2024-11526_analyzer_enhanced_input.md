## Vulnerability Description
IrfanView CGM File Parsing **Out-Of-Bounds Read** Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of IrfanView. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of CGM files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-24600.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing CGM files, leading to a read past the end of an allocated buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds read vulnerability due to insufficient input validation while parsing CGM files.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack requires user interaction, either by visiting a malicious page or opening a malicious CGM file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious CGM file or a malicious page that triggers the vulnerable parsing functionality in IrfanView.
