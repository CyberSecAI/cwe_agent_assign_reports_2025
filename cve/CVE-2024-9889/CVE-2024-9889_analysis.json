This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to view private/draft/password protected posts, pages, and Elementor templates that they should not have access to.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-9889:\n\n**1. Verification of CVE Relevance**\n   - The provided content directly mentions CVE-2024-9889 and describes a vulnerability in the \"ElementInvader Addons for Elementor\" plugin, which aligns with the CVE ID. Therefore, the content is relevant to the CVE.\n\n**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability**\n   - The root cause is a lack of proper access control checks in the Page Loader widget of the ElementInvader Addons for Elementor plugin.\n\n**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**\n   - The plugin is vulnerable to **Sensitive Information Exposure**.\n   - Specifically, the Page Loader widget does not verify if the logged-in user has the necessary permissions to view the content being loaded.\n\n**4. Impact of Exploitation**\n   - **Impact:** Authenticated attackers with \"Contributor\" level access or higher can view private, draft, or password-protected posts, pages, and Elementor templates. This is sensitive information that these users should not have access to.\n   - **Confidentiality:** Unauthorized disclosure of content intended to be private.\n\n**5. Attack Vectors**\n   - **Network:** Exploitation occurs over the network.\n   - **Widget:** Attackers leverage the vulnerable Page Loader widget.\n\n**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**\n   - **Authentication:** Attackers must be authenticated WordPress users.\n   - **Access Level:** Attackers need at least \"Contributor\" level access on the WordPress site.\n   - **Plugin Installation:** The vulnerable \"ElementInvader Addons for Elementor\" plugin must be installed and active on the WordPress site.\n   - **Exploitation:** The attacker needs to use the Page Loader widget functionality to load content they should not have access to.\n\n**Additional Notes from the provided Content:**\n- The vulnerability is present in versions <= 1.2.9 of the plugin.\n- The issue was fixed in version 1.3.0.\n- The patch included checks to ensure that the user has the appropriate permissions before loading content using the pageloader widget.\n- The fix also includes a check to prevent access to private, draft, and password-protected posts when using the `shortcode-post_content.php` shortcode, and similar checks when using the `widgets/pageloader.php` widget.\n- The `ajax-handler.php` file was also modified to not include the `g-recaptcha-response` value in the message body. Additionally, the function used to handle mail subject templates, was modified to properly lowercase keys used for value replacement.\n\nIn summary, this vulnerability allows low-level authenticated users to bypass WordPress's access controls and view private content by using a vulnerable plugin widget.",

CWE-862 is a Class-level CWE, while CWE-200 is a Base-level CWE. While it might seem more specific to directly map to CWE-200, the root cause is the **missing authorization** check, making CWE-862 more appropriate as the primary weakness.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe200 -->|CANRESULTIN| cwe862\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authorization** check (CWE-862), which leads to the **exposure of sensitive information** (CWE-200). The chain is: Missing Authorization -> Information Exposure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified that the plugin is vulnerable to **sensitive information exposure** because it allows authenticated attackers with contributor-level access to view private/draft/password-protected posts, pages, and Elementor templates. The root cause is a **missing authorization** check. While it's tempting to directly map to CWE-200, the provided analysis highlights that the absence of authorization is the key issue.\n\nThe retriever results consistently point to CWE-862 **Missing Authorization** and CWE-863 **Incorrect Authorization** as highly relevant. However, the vulnerability description explicitly mentions that attackers can access resources they should not have access to, indicating a **missing authorization** check rather than an **incorrect** one. Therefore, CWE-862 is more appropriate.\n\nCWE-200 is a valid secondary concern as it describes the impact of the **missing authorization**. The relationship analysis further supports this, as CWE-862 can lead to CWE-200.\n\nThe selection of CWE-862 is at the Class level, and although it's recommended to use Base or Variant levels when possible, there isn't a more specific CWE that accurately captures the **missing authorization** at a lower level.\n\n*Evidence:*\n\"This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to view private/draft/password protected posts, pages, and Elementor templates that they should not have access to.\" This quote points to resources being accessible without proper checks.\n\n# Relevant CWE Information:\n## CWE-862: Missing Authorization\n**Abstraction:** Class.\nThe product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n**Abstraction:** Base.\nThe product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.",
