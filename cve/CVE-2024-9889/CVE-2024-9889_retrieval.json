This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to view private/draft/password protected posts, pages, and Elementor templates that they should not have access to.', key_phrases={'rootcause': '', 'weakness': ['Sensitive Information Exposure', 'information disclosure'], 'impact': ['view private/draft/password protected posts', 'pages', 'and Elementor templates'], 'vector': '', 'attacker': 'authenticated attackers with contributor-level access and above', 'product': 'ElementInvader Addons for Elementor WordPress plugin', 'version': 'up to and including 1.2.9', 'component': 'Page Loader widget'}, reference_content='Based on the provided information, here\\'s an analysis of CVE-2024-9889:\\n\\n**1. Verification of CVE Relevance**\\n   - The provided content directly mentions CVE-2024-9889 and describes a vulnerability in the \"ElementInvader Addons for Elementor\" plugin, which aligns with the CVE ID. Therefore, the content is relevant to the CVE.\\n\\n**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability**\\n   - The root cause is a lack of proper access control checks in the Page Loader widget of the ElementInvader Addons for Elementor plugin.\\n\\n**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**\\n   - The plugin is vulnerable to **Sensitive Information Exposure**.\\n   - Specifically, the Page Loader widget does not verify if the logged-in user has the necessary permissions to view the content being loaded.\\n\\n**4. Impact of Exploitation**\\n   - **Impact:** Authenticated attackers with \"Contributor\" level access or higher can view private, draft, or password-protected posts, pages, and Elementor templates. This is sensitive information that these users should not have access to.\\n   - **Confidentiality:** Unauthorized disclosure of content intended to be private.\\n\\n**5. Attack Vectors**\\n   - **Network:** Exploitation occurs over the network.\\n   - **Widget:** Attackers leverage the vulnerable Page Loader widget.\\n\\n**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**\\n   - **Authentication:** Attackers must be authenticated WordPress users.\\n   - **Access Level:** Attackers need at least \"Contributor\" level access on the WordPress site.\\n   - **Plugin Installation:** The vulnerable \"ElementInvader Addons for Elementor\" plugin must be installed and active on the WordPress site.\\n   - **Exploitation:** The attacker needs to use the Page Loader widget functionality to load content they should not have access to.\\n\\n**Additional Notes from the provided Content:**\\n- The vulnerability is present in versions <= 1.2.9 of the plugin.\\n- The issue was fixed in version 1.3.0.\\n- The patch included checks to ensure that the user has the appropriate permissions before loading content using the pageloader widget.\\n- The fix also includes a check to prevent access to private, draft, and password-protected posts when using the `shortcode-post_content.php` shortcode, and similar checks when using the `widgets/pageloader.php` widget.\\n- The `ajax-handler.php` file was also modified to not include the `g-recaptcha-response` value in the message body. Additionally, the function used to handle mail subject templates, was modified to properly lowercase keys used for value replacement.\\n\\nIn summary, this vulnerability allows low-level authenticated users to bypass WordPress\\'s access controls and view private content by using a vulnerable plugin widget.', similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats':
