This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Wyze Cam v3 IP cameras. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the run_action_batch endpoint of the cloud infrastructure. The issue results from the use of the devices MAC address as a sole credential for authentication. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-22393. Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-288 CWE-321 CWE-280 CWE-290 CWE-306 CWE-20 CWE-1391 CWE-259 CWE-287",
