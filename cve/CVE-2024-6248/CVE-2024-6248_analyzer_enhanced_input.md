## Vulnerability Description
Wyze Cam v3 Cloud Infrastructure Improper Authentication Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Wyze Cam v3 IP cameras. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the run_action_batch endpoint of the cloud infrastructure. The issue results from the use of the devices MAC address as a sole credential for authentication. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-22393.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **improper authentication**
- **impact:** Remote Code Execution and execute arbitrary code
- **attacker:** network-adjacent attackers
- **product:** Wyze Cam v3 IP cameras
- **component:** run_action_batch endpoint of the cloud infrastructure

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-6248

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the Wyze Cam v3 cloud infrastructure's use of the device's MAC address as the sole credential for authentication. This weak authentication allows attackers to bypass security measures and gain unauthorized access to the device.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Authentication:** The primary weakness is the inadequate authentication mechanism, which relies solely on the device's MAC address. MAC addresses are easily discoverable and spoofable, making them unsuitable for secure authentication.
- **Authentication Bypass:** This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to bypass authentication entirely.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Attackers can execute arbitrary code on affected Wyze Cam v3 devices. This can lead to complete compromise of the device.
- **Root access:** The vulnerability, when combined with other vulnerabilities, allows for code execution in the context of root, granting extensive control to the attacker.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-Adjacent Attacks:** Attackers need to be on the same network as the vulnerable Wyze Cam v3 device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Proximity:** The attacker must be located on the same network segment as the targeted Wyze Cam v3 device.
- **Knowledge of MAC Address:** The attacker needs to know the MAC address of the target Wyze Cam v3.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability exists in the `run_action_batch` endpoint of the cloud infrastructure.
- The vulnerability was reported to Wyze on 2023-11-15, and a coordinated public release of the advisory was made on 2024-06-21.
- Wyze has issued an update to correct this vulnerability.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control

**Authentication**:
Determines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.

* Example phrases: "user must log in", "lack of login check", "bypasses login"
* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.

  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* – used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).

**Authorization**:
Determines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do. It decides access *after* identity is verified.

* Example phrases: "unauthorized access", "regular user can access admin panel", "role checks are missing"
* CWE relevance: use CWEs like 862, 863, 285 for authorization errors:

  * **CWE-862**: *Missing Authorization* – the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all.
  * **CWE-863**: *Incorrect Authorization* – the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).
  * **CWE-285**: *Improper Authorization* – general category for any flawed authorization logic or design.

**Access Control**:
A broader term that includes both authentication and authorization. Governs how resources are protected and who can access them under what conditions.

* CWE relevance:

  * **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* – top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear.
  * This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.

## Mapping Discussion – Common Misclassification Patterns

### 1. **CWE-306 vs CWE-862**:

* **306** is about lack of **authentication** (e.g., *no login required at all*).
* **862** is about lack of **authorization** *after* authentication (e.g., *admin check missing*).
* ✅ Example CWE-306: *“An unauthenticated attacker can invoke the password reset API.”*
* ✅ Example CWE-862: *“An authenticated user without admin privileges can delete any user account.”*

### 2. **CWE-285 vs CWE-284**:

* **285** is specific to authorization flaws – it's a better choice than 284 **if** the issue involves *improper or missing role checks*.
* **284** should be reserved for general access control issues when it’s unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.

---

## Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification

**Phrase like "unauthorized access" is not enough.**

* If you **cannot determine whether identity was checked**, assume it’s **authorization** and consider 862 or 863.
* If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** → CWE-306.
* If the **access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced**, but it's not due to missing checks, consider **CWE-284**.

---

## Good Mapping Examples

* ✅ **CWE-306**: “The endpoint `/admin/deleteUser` does not require any authentication.”
* ✅ **CWE-862**: “Any logged-in user can change any other user's email without being an admin.”
* ✅ **CWE-863**: “An admin check exists but incorrectly grants access to non-admin users.”
* ✅ **CWE-285**: “Application uses a static role check that fails when roles change dynamically.”
* ✅ **CWE-284**: “Inconsistent enforcement of access rules across services with unclear policy source.”

| Role check is present but flawed                           | CWE-863        |
| General or ambiguous authorization failure                 | CWE-285        |
