This failure in protection mechanisms allows an authenticated user to potentially escalate privileges.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Escalation of Privilege:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can allow a local authenticated user to gain higher-level access than intended.\n*   Specifically, the CVSS v3.1 score indicates a potential for **low** impact on confidentiality, **low** impact on integrity, and **no** impact on availability. However, the scope is changed. The CVSS v4 score indicates **no** impact on confidentiality, **low** impact on integrity, and **no** impact on availability, with no scope change.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Local Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable through local access.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the target system.\n*   **Physical Presence:** The attacker must have local access to the system.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n*   The vulnerability affects Intel\u00ae Xeon\u00ae 6 processor family (Sierra Forest).\n*   Intel has released guidance for Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM, hypervisor) software in virtualized environments.\n*   The advisory states that there is no action required in non-virtualized environments or where SPP is not used.\n\nThis information is more detailed than the placeholder CVE description and provides specifics regarding affected products, attack vectors, and the nature of the vulnerability.",

The vulnerability description explicitly states a \"**Protection mechanism failure**.\" Since the description is not providing additional information, a more granular mapping is not possible based on the provided information. CWE-693 is related to other CWEs through hierarchical and chain relationships, but these relationships do not directly influence the selection in this case due to the limited details available in the vulnerability description.

The \"escalation of privilege\" impact suggests that CWE-266, Incorrect Privilege Assignment, may also be relevant, but is secondary since it is an impact not the root cause. The final decision to prioritize CWE-693 is based on the direct evidence in the vulnerability description, which clearly points to a failure in the protection mechanism.

The memory protection unit (MPU) logic can incorrectly handle such an address overlap and allow the lower-privilege software to read or write into the protected memory region, resulting in privilege escalation attack. An address overlap weakness can also be used to launch a denial of service attack on the higher-privilege software memory regions.\n",
