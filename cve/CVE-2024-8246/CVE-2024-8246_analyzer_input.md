# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-8246

## Vulnerability Description
The Post Form - Registration Form - Profile Form for User Profiles - Frontend Content Forms for User Submissions (UGC) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in all versions up to, and including, 2.8.11. This is due to **plugin not properly restricting what users have access to set the default role on registration forms**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to create a registration form with a custom role that allows them to register as administrators.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **plugin not properly restricting what users have access to set the default role on registration forms**
- **impact:** privilege escalation
- **attacker:** authenticated attackers
- **product:** The Post Form - Registration Form - Profile Form for User Profiles - Frontend Content Forms for User Submissions (UGC) plugin for WordPress
- **version:** all versions up to and including 2.8.11

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-8246:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the "Post Form – Registration Form – Profile Form for User Profiles – Frontend Content Forms for User Submissions (UGC)" plugin not properly restricting access to set the default role on registration forms.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Improper Privilege Management:** The plugin allows users with contributor-level access or higher to set a custom role for new registrations.
- **Insufficient Role Validation:** The plugin fails to properly validate whether a user has the capability to promote users when setting a new user role on a registration form.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker with contributor-level or higher access can create a registration form that assigns the administrator role to new users. By registering through this form, the attacker can gain administrative privileges on the WordPress site.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker must be an authenticated user with at least contributor-level access.
- The attacker creates a registration form using the vulnerable plugin and configures it to assign a high-privilege role to new users (e.g. administrator).
- The attacker, or another user, registers through this form.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the WordPress site with a minimum of 'Contributor' role privileges.
- The attacker needs to have the ability to create registration forms using the vulnerable plugin.

**Additional Details**

The provided changeset shows that the fix implemented in version 2.8.12 involves a check to determine if the selected new user role has the `edit_posts` capability and if the current user can `promote_users`. If the selected role has the `edit_posts` capability but the current user cannot `promote_users`, then the new user role is set to 'subscriber'. This prevents lower-level users from creating forms that register new users as administrators.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* 🔍 *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* 🔍 *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion – CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### 🔸 CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ✅ *“A user created with the ‘guest’ role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ✅ *“The backup service runs as root but only needs read access.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ⚠️ This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### 🔸 CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ✅ *“User can access another user’s invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.”*

## Mapping Examples – Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *“User can escalate privileges to admin.”*
> ❌ Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged – only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ✅ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**

## Good Mapping Examples – Privileges & Permissions

* ✅ **CWE-266**: *“When a new user registers, the system assigns them admin role due to a missing role validation.”*
* ✅ **CWE-250**: *“Installer runs with system-level privileges but doesn't require them to install files in the user directory.”*
* ✅ **CWE-284**: *“Inconsistent access rules between UI and backend for sensitive endpoints.”*
* ✅ **CWE-285**: *“Authorization logic fails to restrict access to finance reports based on department.”*
