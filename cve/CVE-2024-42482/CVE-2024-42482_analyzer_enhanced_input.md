## Vulnerability Description
fish-shop/syntax-check is a GitHub action for syntax checking fish shell files. Improper neutralization of delimiters in the `pattern` input (specifically the command separator `` and command substitution characters `(` and `)`) mean that arbitrary **command injection** is possible by modification of the input value used in a workflow. This has the potential for exposure or exfiltration of sensitive information from the workflow runner, such as might be achieved by sending environment variables to an external entity. It is recommended that users update to the patched version `v1.6.12` or the latest release version `v2.0.0`, however remediation may be possible through careful control of workflows and the `pattern` input value used by this action.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **Improper input sanitization**
- **weakness:** **command injection**
- **impact:** arbitrary command execution
- **vector:** modification of the input value
- **product:** fish-shop/syntax-check
- **component:** pattern input

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-42482:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of delimiters in the `pattern` input of the `fish-shop/syntax-check` GitHub Action. Specifically, command separators (`;`) and command substitution characters (`(` and `)`) are not neutralized, leading to potential command injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **CWE-140: Improper Neutralization of Delimiters:** The action fails to properly sanitize or escape user-controlled input (`pattern`) before using it in a command execution context. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands by manipulating the `pattern` input.
- **Command Injection:** The vulnerability allows for the execution of arbitrary commands on the workflow runner, which can be exploited to gain unauthorized access or control over the system.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to:
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the workflow runner.
- **Sensitive Information Exposure/Exfiltration:** Attackers can access and potentially exfiltrate sensitive information like environment variables, API keys, or other secrets stored in the workflow runner environment.
- **Compromise of the Build Environment:** An attacker might be able to manipulate the build process or install malicious software on the runner.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker can inject malicious commands into the `pattern` input of the GitHub Action. This input is used within an `eval` statement in the action's shell script.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to control or influence the `pattern` input of the `fish-shop/syntax-check` GitHub Action. This could be achieved through:
    - Submitting a pull request that modifies the workflow definition, and injects malicious code into the pattern input.
    - Exploiting a vulnerability in a related system to modify workflow files that make use of the vulnerable action.
    - Being an internal actor with push rights to the repository who can directly modify the workflow files.

The provided information includes:
- **Vulnerability description:** Describes the root cause and impact of the improper neutralization of delimiters
- **Affected versions:** Lists the vulnerable versions.
- **Patched versions:** Identifies the versions that include a fix for the vulnerability
- **Workaround:** Suggests updating to patched versions and to be cautious of the input value.
- **References:** Links to relevant CWE and CAPEC entries, providing further context on the vulnerability.
- **Patch summary:** Details the commits that introduced the fix, and their associated versions.
- **Severity:** Labels the severity of the issue as "Moderate"
