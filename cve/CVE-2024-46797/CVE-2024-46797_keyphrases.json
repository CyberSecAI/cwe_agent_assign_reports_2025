  "keyphrases": {
    "rootcause": "A race condition in queued_spin_lock_slowpath() leads to a deadlock. Specifically, an interrupt occurring after incrementing qnodesp->count but before initializing node->lock can cause another CPU to read stale lock values from get_tail_qnode(). If this stale lock value matches the lock on the other CPU, it can result in incorrect next pointer assignment in the MCS queue, causing a deadlock.",
    "weakness": "Race condition due to the lack of proper synchronization between incrementing the qnodesp->count and initializing node->lock in the queued_spin_lock_slowpath() function."
