  "query": "reNgine is an automated reconnaissance framework for web applications. A vulnerability was discovered in reNgine, where **an insider attacker with any role** (such as Auditor, Penetration Tester, or Sys Admin) **can extract sensitive information from other reNgine users.** After running a scan and obtaining vulnerabilities from a target, the attacker can retrieve details such as `username`, `password`, `email`, `role`, `first name`, `last name`, `status`, and `activity information` by making a GET request to `/api/listVulnerability/`. This issue has been addressed in version 2.2.0 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",
