  "description": "A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, was found in FFmpeg up to 7.1. This affects the function ff_aac_search_for_tns of the file libavcodec/aacenc_tns.c of the component AAC Encoder. The manipulation leads to **stack-based buffer overflow**. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.",
