CWE-863 is a more specific child of CWE-284, and its description aligns better with the vulnerability details. The guidance recommends using more specific CWEs when possible. Therefore, CWE-863 is preferred over CWE-284. There are not sufficient details to choose a Base CWE below CWE-863.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **Incorrect Authorization** (CWE-863) issue, where the system performs an authorization check but does it incorrectly. This leads to a security feature bypass, allowing a low-privileged attacker to view select information. The chain is:\n\n1.  **Incorrect Authorization** (CWE-863) - Root cause: The system incorrectly checks authorization.\n2.  Security Feature Bypass - Impact: A low-privileged attacker can view select information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability, which is an authorization issue. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"**Incorrect Authorization**\", which strongly suggests CWE-863. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this with \"Improper Access Control\", which maps to either CWE-284, CWE-862, or CWE-863, but the provided text mentions that the attacker is low-priviledged.\n\nThe retriever results also list CWE-863 as a potential candidate. The guidance provided in the Enhanced Context section, particularly the Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control guidance, further supports this decision. Since the issue involves a flaw in how authorization checks are performed, CWE-863 is more appropriate than CWE-284 (a more general access control issue) or CWE-862 (missing authorization). CWE-306, Missing Authentication, is not applicable because the attacker requires authentication.\n\nThe final selection of CWE-863 is based on the explicit mention of \"**Incorrect Authorization**\" in the vulnerability description, the CVE Reference Links Content Summary pointing to \"Improper Access Control\", the retriever results, and the guidance emphasizing the importance of choosing the most specific CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
