While the description mentions \"**Missing Authorization**\" directly, the context also suggests a potential lack of proper authentication mechanisms. The guidance clearly states that authentication comes before authorization. The description includes Stored XSS which is a consequence of the **missing authorization**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    \n    cwe79 -- CANFOLLOW --> cwe862\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe79 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **Missing Authorization** (CWE-862), which allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts. This leads to Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') (CWE-79).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment, based on the description's emphasis on \"**Missing Authorization**\", strongly pointed towards CWE-862 as the primary weakness. The presence of Stored XSS as the impact further solidified this choice, suggesting that the lack of authorization allowed for the injection and storage of malicious scripts.\n\nThe evidence supporting this decision is primarily derived from the vulnerability description, which explicitly mentions \"**Missing Authorization**\" and the resulting Stored XSS. The \"**rootcause:** **Missing Authorization**\" further confirms this assessment.\n\nThe graph relationships reinforced this selection by highlighting the connection between **missing authorization** and the potential for subsequent vulnerabilities like XSS (CWE-79).\n\nThe selection of CWE-862 and CWE-79 is at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-862 accurately reflects the core issue of missing authorization checks, while CWE-79 describes the specific type of vulnerability (XSS) that arises as a consequence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
