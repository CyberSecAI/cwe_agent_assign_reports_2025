## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Here's an analysis of the provided content, focusing on CVE-2025-48205:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2025-48205

**Relates to CVE:** YES

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The extension "Front End User Registration" (sr\_feuser\_register) allows the exchange of a serialized file object representation of a previously uploaded file without proper validation. This enables an attacker to inject arbitrary serialized PHP objects, which may be deserialized on the server side. Additionally, the extension does not verify if a specified file identifier is authorized for download.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Remote Code Execution (RCE)
*   Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **RCE:** Potential for arbitrary code execution on the server.
*   **IDOR:** Unauthorized disclosure and download of arbitrary files.

**Attack vectors:**
*   Exploitation of improper serialization validation.
*   Exploitation of missing authorization checks for file downloads.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   Unauthenticated attacker (no authentication required).
*   Ability to send a crafted serialized PHP object.
*   Ability to request arbitrary files via their identifier.

**Mitigation or fix:**
*   Update to version 12.5.0 or later of the "Front End User Registration" extension.

**Additional details (compared to a potential official CVE description):**
*   Provides the affected version range (5.1.0 â€“ 12.4.8).
*   Includes the Composer package name (sjbr/sr-feuser-register).
*   Provides the CVSS v3.1 vector string ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:F/RL:O/RC:C]).
*   Lists CWE references (CWE-502, CWE-639).
*   Credits the researchers who reported the vulnerabilities.
*   Provides links to download the updated version and to the TYPO3 security guide.
