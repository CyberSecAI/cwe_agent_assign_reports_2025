# Raw Analyzer Response for CVE-2024-37110

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-200 | Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor | 0.9 | Class | Primary | Discouraged because it is a Class level. However, given the limited information, it is the most appropriate.|
| CWE-359 | Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor | 0.6 | Base | Secondary | Allowed. Considered due to the exposure of private information, but not selected as primary due to lack of explicit evidence that the exposed information was private or personal.|

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.75
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE, CWE-200, is a class-level CWE, while CWE-359 is a base-level CWE and a child of CWE-200. While a base-level CWE is preferred, the vulnerability description doesn't explicitly state the exposure was private or personal information. Therefore, CWE-200 is selected as the primary CWE, with CWE-359 as a secondary candidate. The retriever results also suggest that CWE-200 is a strong candidate.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with a **weakness** that leads to the **Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor**, which is the impact.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment considered the retriever results, which identified CWE-200 as a potential candidate. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" confirms that the root cause of the vulnerability is a "sensitive data exposure vulnerability" and that "a malicious actor can view sensitive information that should not be accessible to regular users". This evidence supports the selection of CWE-200 as the primary CWE.

The relationship analysis shows that CWE-359 is a child of CWE-200, representing a more specific case of sensitive information exposure. However, the vulnerability description does not explicitly state that the exposed information is private or personal. Therefore, while CWE-359 is considered, CWE-200 is chosen as the primary CWE due to its broader applicability to the **exposure of sensitive information**.

The selection of CWE-200 is at the class level of abstraction, which is not ideal. Ideally a Base or Variant level CWE is preferred. However, with the limited information, it is difficult to pinpoint the exact nature of the exposed information. CWE-359 is a good secondary candidate.

The product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-359: Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly prevent a person's private, personal information from being accessed by actors who either (1) are not explicitly authorized to access the information or (2) do not have the implicit consent of the person about whom the information is collected.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
