Here's an analysis of the information related to CVE-2024-23465:\n\n**CVE-2024-23465:**\n\n*   **Vulnerability Title:** SolarWinds Access Rights Manager (ARM) ChangeHumster Exposed Dangerous Method Authentication Bypass Vulnerability\n*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from an exposed dangerous method named `ChangeHumster`. This method allows for an authentication bypass.\n*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary weakness is an authentication bypass that is caused by an exposed, dangerous method.\n*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an unauthenticated user to gain domain admin access within the Active Directory environment.\n*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector involves direct interaction with the vulnerable method, `ChangeHumster`, and does not require prior authentication.\n*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker only needs network access to the vulnerable ARM server, as no authentication is needed to exploit this.",

The **authentication bypass** is due to an exposed dangerous method. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-288, which represents an authentication bypass using an alternate path. CWE-305 is a secondary CWE because the bypass is caused by a primary weakness, in this case an exposed dangerous method. CWE-288 is a child of CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) and CWE-425 (Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')).

The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" states that the \"**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from an exposed dangerous method named `ChangeHumster`. This method allows for an **authentication bypass**.\" This indicates an alternate path, as the normal authentication process is bypassed.
