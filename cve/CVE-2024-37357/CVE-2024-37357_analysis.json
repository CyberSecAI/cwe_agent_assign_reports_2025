Then the `TR069_local_port` is used in two `sprintf` calls to build iptables commands which are then copied to a stack buffer of size 0x100. Since the input isn't checked, a buffer overflow occurs.\n    *   The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a POST request to the `adm.cgi` binary with the `page=TR069` parameter and a crafted `TR069_local_port` value (longer than 0x100 bytes).\n*   **Mitigation/Fix:** The vendor has discontinued the product, but patches are being worked on.\n\n**Note:** The content provides more detail than the official CVE description.",

The `sprintf` call copies data to a stack buffer without checking the size of the input. |\n| CWE-121 | Stack-based Buffer Overflow | 0.75 | Variant | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The vulnerability is specifically a stack-based buffer overflow. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-120, which describes a buffer copy operation without checking the size of the input. CWE-121, Stack-based Buffer Overflow, is a variant of a more general buffer overflow, specifying that the buffer is allocated on the stack. CWE-120 can precede CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write), which is a consequence of the overflow.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe120[\"CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input\"]\n    cwe121[\"CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    \n    cwe121 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe120 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe120 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe787\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe120 primary\n    class cwe121 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of input size validation** when copying the `TR069_local_port` POST parameter using `sprintf` to a stack buffer. This **missing check** leads to a buffer overflow on the stack, potentially allowing for arbitrary code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is the **buffer overflow** due to the **lack of input validation** when copying the `TR069_local_port` parameter to a stack buffer. The `sprintf` function is used to copy the data, and the size of the input is not checked against the buffer's capacity, leading to a buffer overflow. The reference link summary confirms this by stating: \"Insufficient bounds checking on the `TR069_local_port` POST parameter when used in `sprintf` calls which copy the data to the stack.\"\n\nCWE-120 is the most appropriate primary CWE because it directly reflects the root cause: copying a buffer without checking its size. CWE-121 is a more specific variant indicating that the buffer is on the stack. The evidence strongly supports selecting these CWEs.\n\nCWE-119 was considered but deemed too general. While it encompasses buffer overflows, CWE-120 and CWE-121 provide a more precise characterization of the vulnerability. Other CWEs like CWE-190 (Integer Overflow) and CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input) were also considered but did not directly address the root cause of the **buffer overflow** resulting from the **unchecked copy operation**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA stack-based buffer overflow condition is a condition where the buffer being overwritten is allocated on the stack (i.e., is a local variable or, rarely, a parameter to a function).\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-134: Use of Externally-Controlled Format String\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a function that accepts a format string as an argument, but the format string originates from an external source.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-790: Improper Filtering of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives data from an upstream component, but does not filter or incorrectly filters special elements before sending it to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-805: Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a sequential operation to read or write a buffer, but it uses an incorrect length value that causes it to access memory that is outside of the bounds of the buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary.
