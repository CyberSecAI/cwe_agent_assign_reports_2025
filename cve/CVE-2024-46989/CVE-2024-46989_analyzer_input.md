# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-46989

## Vulnerability Description
spicedb is an Open Source, Google Zanzibar-inspired permissions database to enable fine-grained authorization for customer applications. **Multiple caveats over the same indirect subject type on the same relation** can result in no permission being returned when permission is expected. If the resource has multiple groups, and each group is caveated, it is possible for the returned permission to be no permission when permission is expected. Permission is returned as NO_PERMISSION when PERMISSION is expected on the CheckPermission API. This issue has been addressed in release version 1.35.3. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should not use caveats or avoid the use of caveats on an indirect subject type with multiple entries.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **Multiple caveats over the same indirect subject type on the same relation**
- **impact:** no permission being returned when permission is expected
- **product:** spicedb
- **version:** prior to 1.35.3
- **component:** CheckPermission API

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-46989:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from how SpiceDB handles multiple caveats applied to the same indirect subject type within a relation. When a resource has multiple relations to a subject type, and each relation is associated with a caveat, the permission check logic can incorrectly return "no permission" even when permission should be granted based on the individual caveats.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Incorrect handling of multiple caveats on the same indirect subject type within a relation.
- Failure to properly aggregate or evaluate caveats when multiple paths to the subject exist.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The primary impact is an incorrect permission check result. Specifically, the `CheckPermission` API may return `NO_PERMISSION` when the intended result should be `PERMISSION` or `CAVEATED_MEMBER`. This can lead to users being denied access to resources they should have access to.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based (`AV:N`), meaning the vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
- The attack complexity is considered high (`AC:H`), indicating that the conditions for exploitation may be somewhat specific.
- No privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability (`PR:N`).
- No user interaction is required (`UI:N`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need any special privileges or user interaction to exploit the vulnerability, but must be able to make requests over the network to the service.
- The attacker must understand the schema, caveats and relations to configure the necessary relations and resources to trigger the flawed logic.
- The attacker must be able to define multiple relations with caveats to the same indirect subject type.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in versions of SpiceDB prior to 1.35.3.
- The fix is included in version 1.35.3.
- The vulnerability is rated as low severity (3.7) due to the limited impact. The confidentiality and availability impacts are none, and the integrity impact is low.
- The provided code diff in the first document shows the changes made to correct the behaviour, and introduces new test cases.

**Example Scenario:**

Given the following schema:

```
definition user {}

caveat somecaveat(somefield int) {
  somefield == 42
}

definition group {
  relation member: user
}

definition resource {
  relation viewer: group#member with somecaveat
  permission view = viewer
}
```

If a resource has multiple groups associated with it, each with a different caveat, it might incorrectly return "no permission" for a user who satisfies at least one of the caveats.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set ‚Äì Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control

**Authentication**:
Determines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.

* Example phrases: "user must log in", "lack of login check", "bypasses login"
* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.

  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* ‚Äì used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).

**Authorization**:
Determines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do. It decides access *after* identity is verified.

* Example phrases: "unauthorized access", "regular user can access admin panel", "role checks are missing"
* CWE relevance: use CWEs like 862, 863, 285 for authorization errors:

  * **CWE-862**: *Missing Authorization* ‚Äì the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all.
  * **CWE-863**: *Incorrect Authorization* ‚Äì the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).
  * **CWE-285**: *Improper Authorization* ‚Äì general category for any flawed authorization logic or design.

**Access Control**:
A broader term that includes both authentication and authorization. Governs how resources are protected and who can access them under what conditions.

* CWE relevance:

  * **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* ‚Äì top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear.
  * This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.

---

## Mapping Discussion ‚Äì Common Misclassification Patterns

### 1. **CWE-306 vs CWE-862**:

* **306** is about lack of **authentication** (e.g., *no login required at all*).
* **862** is about lack of **authorization** *after* authentication (e.g., *admin check missing*).
* ‚úÖ Example CWE-306: *‚ÄúAn unauthenticated attacker can invoke the password reset API.‚Äù*
* ‚úÖ Example CWE-862: *‚ÄúAn authenticated user without admin privileges can delete any user account.‚Äù*

### 2. **CWE-285 vs CWE-284**:

* **285** is specific to authorization flaws ‚Äì it's a better choice than 284 **if** the issue involves *improper or missing role checks*.
* **284** should be reserved for general access control issues when it‚Äôs unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.

---

## Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification

**Phrase like "unauthorized access" is not enough.**

* If you **cannot determine whether identity was checked**, assume it‚Äôs **authorization** and consider 862 or 863.
* If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** ‚Üí CWE-306.
* If the **access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced**, but it's not due to missing checks, consider **CWE-284**.

---

## Good Mapping Examples

* ‚úÖ **CWE-306**: ‚ÄúThe endpoint `/admin/deleteUser` does not require any authentication.‚Äù
* ‚úÖ **CWE-862**: ‚ÄúAny logged-in user can change any other user's email without being an admin.‚Äù
* ‚úÖ **CWE-863**: ‚ÄúAn admin check exists but incorrectly grants access to non-admin users.‚Äù
* ‚úÖ **CWE-285**: ‚ÄúApplication uses a static role check that fails when roles change dynamically.‚Äù
* ‚úÖ **CWE-284**: ‚ÄúInconsistent enforcement of access rules across services with unclear policy source.‚Äù

## Summary ‚Äì Quick LLM Rules of Thumb

| **Indicator**                                              | **Likely CWE** |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| No identity check (no login)                               | CWE-306        |
| No role/privilege check after login                        | CWE-862        |
| Role check is present but flawed                           | CWE-863        |
| General or ambiguous authorization failure                 | CWE-285        |
| High-level access control problem with no clear root cause | CWE-284        |



### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set ‚Äì Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* üîç *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* üîç *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion ‚Äì CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### üî∏ CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ‚úÖ *‚ÄúA user created with the ‚Äòguest‚Äô role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.‚Äù*

#### üî∏ CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ‚úÖ *‚ÄúThe backup service runs as root but only needs read access.‚Äù*

#### üî∏ CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### üî∏ CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ‚úÖ *‚ÄúUser can access another user‚Äôs invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.‚Äù*

## Mapping Examples ‚Äì Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *‚ÄúUser can escalate privileges to admin.‚Äù*
> ‚ùå Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged ‚Äì only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ‚úÖ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**
