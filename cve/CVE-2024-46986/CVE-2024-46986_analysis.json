  "description": "Camaleon CMS is a dynamic and advanced content management system based on Ruby on Rails. An arbitrary file write vulnerability accessible via the upload method of the MediaController allows authenticated users to write arbitrary files to any location on the web server Camaleon CMS is running on (depending on the permissions of the underlying filesystem). E.g. This can lead to a delayed remote code execution in case an attacker is able to write a Ruby file into the config/initializers/ subfolder of the Ruby on Rails application. This issue has been addressed in release version 2.8.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-46986:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-provided input used in file path construction within the `camaleon_cms` application. Specifically, the `folder` parameter provided during file uploads is directly concatenated into a file path without validation.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- **Path Traversal (CWE-22):** The application does not sanitize the `folder` parameter, allowing attackers to use `../` sequences or absolute paths to traverse the file system outside the intended upload directory.\n- **Arbitrary File Write:** By controlling the destination path, an attacker can write files to any location on the server where the web server's user has write permissions.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By writing malicious files, such as Ruby scripts, into sensitive directories like `config/initializers/`, an attacker can achieve remote code execution on the server after a restart.\n- **Arbitrary file modification/deletion:** Depending on the attacker's goals and system permissions, they can potentially modify existing files or delete important system files.\n- **Information disclosure:** An attacker might be able to write a file to any location and read from it after upload, even outside the web root.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- The vulnerability is accessible through the `/admin/media/upload` endpoint.\n- The attack is performed by crafting a POST request with a `folder` parameter containing path traversal sequences.\n- An authenticated user account is required to access this endpoint.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- The attacker needs to have a valid user account on the `camaleon_cms` application.\n- The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the `/admin/media/upload` endpoint.\n- The attacker should have a basic understanding of HTTP requests and multipart form data.\n\n**Additional details from the provided content (beyond the CVE description):**\n- The vulnerability is located in the `MediaController` (`upload` method) and `uploader_helper` (`upload_file` method) of the `camaleon_cms` application.\n- The `file_upload` parameter also plays a role, as the content of this file is what is written to the file system. The filename, however, is not directly used, so it is not related to the vulnerability.\n- The `formats` parameter can be used to bypass file format validations to upload any file type.\n- The provided proof of concept demonstrates how to upload a Ruby file to the `config/initializers/` directory and achieve RCE when the application is restarted.\n- The advisory mentions that this vulnerability was reported through GitHub Security Lab (GHSL-2024-182).\n- The advisory also includes remediation advice, recommending to sanitize input paths before using them.\n\nThe provided content gives a detailed analysis of the vulnerability, including the affected code, the exploitation steps, and the remediation advice. This goes beyond the general description of the CVE.",

This is supported by the vulnerability description and CVE reference summary. CWE-22 has parent-child relationships with CWE-23 (Relative Path Traversal) and peer relationships with other path manipulation issues. CWE-434 and CWE-96 are considered as secondary CWEs due to the potential for file upload and code injection as a result of the path traversal. The base level of abstraction is chosen for CWE-22 as it directly represents the **improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory**, which is the root cause.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\"]\n    cwe23[\"CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\"]\n    cwe434[\"CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\"]\n    cwe96[\"CWE-96: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Statically Saved Code ('Static Code Injection')\"]\n\n    cwe23 -->|CHILDOF| cwe22\n    cwe434 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe22\n    cwe96 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe22\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe22 primary\n    class cwe23,cwe434,cwe96 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the **lack of proper sanitization** of the `folder` parameter, leading to **path traversal** (CWE-22). This enables **arbitrary file write**, which can then lead to **remote code execution** if an attacker uploads a malicious Ruby file to a sensitive directory such as `config/initializers/` (potentially CWE-96).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly pointed to CWE-22 as the primary weakness due to the **improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory**. The CVE reference summary explicitly mentions **Path Traversal (CWE-22)** as a weakness. The ability to write arbitrary files (CWE-434) and achieve remote code execution (potentially CWE-96) are consequences of this primary weakness. The selection of CWE-22 is at the optimal level of specificity as it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability. The other CWEs are secondary candidates based on the potential impacts. The confidence in this assessment is high due to the explicit mention of path traversal in the CVE details and the clear description of how the vulnerability is exploited.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
