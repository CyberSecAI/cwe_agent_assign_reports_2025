# Analysis Report for CVE-2024-46986

# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-46986

## Description

Camaleon CMS is a dynamic and advanced content management system based on Ruby on Rails. An arbitrary file write vulnerability accessible via the upload method of the MediaController allows authenticated users to write arbitrary files to any location on the web server Camaleon CMS is running on (depending on the permissions of the underlying filesystem). E.g. This can lead to a delayed remote code execution in case an attacker is able to write a Ruby file into the config/initializers/ subfolder of the Ruby on Rails application. This issue has been addressed in release version 2.8.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Impact:** ['arbitrary file write', 'remote code execution']
- **Vector:** upload method
- **Attacker:** authenticated users
- **Product:** Camaleon CMS
- **Version:** before 2.8.2
- **Component:** MediaController

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-22 | Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') | 1.0 | Base | Primary CWE | Allowed |
| CWE-434 | Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type | 0.7 | Base | Secondary Candidate | Allowed |
| CWE-96 | Improper Neutralization of Directives in Statically Saved Code ('Static Code Injection') | 0.6 | Base | Secondary Candidate | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-22, which describes path traversal vulnerabilities. This is supported by the vulnerability description and CVE reference summary. CWE-22 has parent-child relationships with CWE-23 (Relative Path Traversal) and peer relationships with other path manipulation issues. CWE-434 and CWE-96 are considered as secondary CWEs due to the potential for file upload and code injection as a result of the path traversal. The base level of abstraction is chosen for CWE-22 as it directly represents the **improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory**, which is the root cause.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain begins with the **lack of proper sanitization** of the `folder` parameter, leading to **path traversal** (CWE-22). This enables **arbitrary file write**, which can then lead to **remote code execution** if an attacker uploads a malicious Ruby file to a sensitive directory such as `config/initializers/` (potentially CWE-96).

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis strongly pointed to CWE-22 as the primary weakness due to the **improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory**. The CVE reference summary explicitly mentions **Path Traversal (CWE-22)** as a weakness. The ability to write arbitrary files (CWE-434) and achieve remote code execution (potentially CWE-96) are consequences of this primary weakness. The selection of CWE-22 is at the optimal level of specificity as it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability. The other CWEs are secondary candidates based on the potential impacts. The confidence in this assessment is high due to the explicit mention of path traversal in the CVE details and the clear description of how the vulnerability is exploited.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names. The associated manipulations are intended to generate multiple names for the same object.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as ".." that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges 
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions. This may cause it to follow unexpected code paths that may leave the product in an invalid state.
