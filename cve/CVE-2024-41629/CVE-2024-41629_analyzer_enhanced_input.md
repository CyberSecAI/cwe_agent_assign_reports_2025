## Vulnerability Description
An issue in Texas Instruments Fusion Digital Power Designer v.7.10.1 allows a local attacker to obtain sensitive information via the **plaintext storage of credentials**

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **plaintext storage of credentials**
- **impact:** obtain sensitive information
- **attacker:** local attacker
- **product:** Texas Instruments Fusion Digital Power Designer
- **version:** v.7.10.1

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The Texas Instruments Fusion Digital Power Designer v.7.10.1 application stores credentials in plaintext within a configuration file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Insufficiently Protected Credentials: Sensitive information, specifically credentials, are stored without encryption or proper protection.
- Plaintext Storage: Credentials are stored in a human-readable format within an XML file (`prefs-shared.xml`).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: A local attacker can gain unauthorized access to sensitive credentials, potentially enabling them to access connected systems or services.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local Access: The attacker needs local access to the machine where the Texas Instruments Fusion Digital Power Designer is installed.
- File System Access: The attacker needs to be able to access the file system and specifically the `prefs-shared.xml` file located at `"C:/Program Files (x86)/Texas Instruments/Fusion Digial Power Designer/data/"`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Local user account on the target system with the ability to read files within the Program Files directory.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is specific to Texas Instruments Fusion Digital Power Designer version 7.10.1.
- The `prefs-shared.xml` file contains the vulnerable plaintext credentials.
