The secondary weakness is CWE-863, Incorrect Authorization, which allows a Contributor+ role to inject the malicious script. CWE-79 is at the Base level, which is preferred. There isn't a direct parent-child relationship evident, but the XSS could potentially lead to account takeover.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe79 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe863\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe79 primary\n    class cwe863 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a Contributor+ having **Incorrect Authorization (CWE-863)** allowing them to inject input. This input is then **Improperly Neutralized (CWE-79)**, resulting in Stored XSS. The impact is account takeover.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description, which clearly states that Stored **XSS** is possible due to embedding malicious scripts. The description also mentions the role of 'Contributor+' which suggests an authorization issue.\nThe primary CWE is CWE-79 because the root cause is the **Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation**, leading to XSS. The secondary CWE is CWE-863 because the Contributor+ role has **Incorrect Authorization**, which is required to inject the malicious code.
