a post\\'s custom field.\\n- When an administrator views the plugin settings page and clicks the \\'List custom fields\\' button, the malicious script executes in their browser, leading to potential account takeover or other malicious actions.\\n- The vulnerability allows a Contributor+ user to escalate privileges.\\n\\n**Attack vectors:**\\n- By injecting malicious Javascript via the custom field \"Name\" parameter when creating or editing a post.\\n\\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\\n- The attacker needs to have at least \"Contributor\" level privileges to create or edit posts.\\n- The attacker needs to access the WordPress admin panel of the affected site.\\n- The admin needs to visit the Relevanssi settings page and click \\'List custom fields\\' for the
