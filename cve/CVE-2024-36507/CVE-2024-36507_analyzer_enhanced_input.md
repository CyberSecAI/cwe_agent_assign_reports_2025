## Vulnerability Description
A **untrusted search path** in Fortinet FortiClientWindows versions 7.4.0, versions 7.2.4 through 7.2.0, versions 7.0.12 through 7.0.0 allows an attacker to run arbitrary code via **DLL hijacking** and social engineering.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **untrusted search path**
- **weakness:** **DLL hijacking**
- **impact:** run arbitrary code
- **vector:** DLL hijacking
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** Fortinet FortiClientWindows
- **version:** ['7.4.0' and '7.2.4 through 7.2.0' and '7.0.12 through 7.0.0']

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An untrusted search path vulnerability (CWE-426) exists in FortiClient Windows. This means that when the FortiClient online installer loads, it searches for required DLL files in locations that an attacker might control.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** DLL hijacking, an untrusted search path vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code by placing a malicious DLL in a location where the FortiClient installer will load it. This can lead to unauthorized code execution on the victim's machine.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to place a malicious DLL file in a location that the FortiClient installer searches before finding the legitimate DLL. This requires social engineering to trick a user into running the modified installer.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have local access and the ability to place a malicious DLL in a location that is searched by the FortiClient installer. They must also trick the user into running the malicious installer.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects FortiClient Windows versions 7.0.0 through 7.0.12, 7.2.0 through 7.2.4 and 7.4.0.
- The vulnerability is classified as Medium severity with a CVSSv3 score of 6.7
- The vulnerability was reported by Aleksandar Marceta-Pavlovic from WKO Inhouse GmbH.
