The vulnerability allowed a hacker to access sensitive information.\n\n*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The archive server of TeleMessage was badly misconfigured.\n    *   Weak password hashing: The admin panel used MD5 for hashing passwords.\n    *   Exposed heapdump endpoint: The server exposed a Java heap dump via a URL ending in **/heapdump**. This endpoint was publicly accessible, allowing the hacker to download the server's memory snapshot.\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n    *   Use of MD5 for password hashing.\n    *   Publicly accessible heap dump endpoint (Spring Boot Actuator misconfiguration).\n    *   Unencrypted messages uploaded to the archive server.\n*   **Impact of exploitation:**\n    *   The hacker could obtain usernames and passwords.\n    *   The hacker could read plaintext chat logs.\n    *   The hacker was able to compromise a customer of US Customs and Border Protection.\n*   **Attack vectors:**\n    *   Exploiting the publicly accessible heap dump endpoint.\n    *   Brute-forcing login credentials via leaked password hashes.\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n    *   Knowledge of web server vulnerabilities.\n    *   Ability to use tools like feroxbuster to discover publicly available resources.\n    *   Ability to analyze Java heap dumps.\n*   **Mitigation or fix:**\n    *   Properly configure the Spring Boot Actuator to restrict access to sensitive endpoints like the heap dump.\n    *   Use stronger password hashing algorithms.\n\n**More detail than official CVE description:** The content provides detailed information about the specific misconfiguration, the tools used to exploit it, and the impact. It goes beyond a generic description of the vulnerability to explain the exact steps taken by the attacker.",

The service **stores certain cleartext information in memory**. |\n| CWE-256 | Plaintext Storage of a Password | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The admin panel used MD5 for hashing passwords, which is weak. |\n| CWE-532 | Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The hacker could read plaintext chat logs |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship that influenced the selection was the parent-child relationship between CWE-311 (Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data) and CWE-316 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in Memory), as well as CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information). CWE-316 is a more specific variant of CWE-311 and CWE-312, making it a better fit for the vulnerability description. The description states that the **cleartext information** is stored **in memory**. CWE-256 can lead to sensitive information being stored in memory. CWE-532 can also lead to sensitive information being available.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe316[\"CWE-316: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in Memory\"]\n    cwe256[\"CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\"]\n    cwe532[\"CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File\"]\n    cwe311[\"CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\"]\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n\n    cwe316 -->|CHILDOF| cwe311\n    cwe316 -->|CHILDOF| cwe312\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe316 primary\n    class cwe256,cwe532 secondary\n    class cwe311,cwe312 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **cleartext storage of sensitive information in memory** (CWE-316), which allows an adversary to access this information if they can access the memory. This leads to potential compromise of user credentials and sensitive data. MD5 hashing (CWE-256) and plaintext chat logs (CWE-532) can also cause similar problems.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE, CWE-316 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in Memory), was selected because the vulnerability description explicitly states that **certain cleartext information** is stored **in memory**. This aligns directly with the CWE's description. The evidence is strong, as the description is clear and unambiguous. The other selected CWEs are related to the root causes that allowed the attacker to access the data in memory. The other potential CWEs were considered but deemed less relevant because they didn't specifically address the **in memory** aspect of this vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product generates an error message that includes sensitive information about its environment, users, or associated data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
