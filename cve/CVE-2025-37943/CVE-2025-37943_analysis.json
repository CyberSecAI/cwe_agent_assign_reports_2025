  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved wifi ath12k Fix invalid data access in ath12k_dp_rx_h_undecap_nwifi In certain cases, hardware might provide packets with a length greater than the maximum native Wi-Fi header length. This can lead to **accessing and modifying fields in the header within the ath12k_dp_rx_h_undecap_nwifi function** for DP_RX_DECAP_TYPE_NATIVE_WIFI decap type and potentially resulting in invalid data access and memory corruption. Add a sanity check before processing the SKB to prevent invalid data access in the undecap native Wi-Fi function for the DP_RX_DECAP_TYPE_NATIVE_WIFI decap type.

The abstraction levels are appropriate, with CWE-787 being a Base level and CWE-1285 also being a Base level.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe1285[\"CWE-1285: Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe1285 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe787\n    cwe1285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe1285 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the hardware providing packets with an invalid length. This leads to **accessing and modifying fields in the header within the ath12k_dp_rx_h_undecap_nwifi function**, resulting in an **out-of-bounds write** (CWE-787) and **memory corruption**. A missing link is the specific validation mechanism that is failing, which would connect the invalid hardware input to the out-of-bounds write.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nBased on the provided evidence, the primary weakness is CWE-787 [CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write], due to the **accessing and modifying fields in the header**, which results in **memory corruption**. The vulnerability description clearly states this. The retriever results also list CWE-787 as the top result.\n\nCWE-1285 [CWE-1285: Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input] is a plausible secondary weakness because the root cause involves hardware providing packets with a length greater than the maximum, which implies a failure to validate the length/size of the packet before processing it. While not explicitly stated, the vulnerability's resolution (adding a sanity check) suggests this.\n\nCWE-119 [CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer] was considered, but the description is too high level. While it is true that an out-of-bounds write falls under the umbrella of CWE-119, CWE-787 is more specific.\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1285: Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input that is expected to specify an index, position, or offset into an indexable resource such as a buffer or file, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the specified index/position/offset has the required properties.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
