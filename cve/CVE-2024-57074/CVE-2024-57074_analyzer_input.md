# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-57074

## Vulnerability Description
A **prototype pollution** in the lib.merge function of xe-utils v3.5.31 allows attackers to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) via supplying a crafted payload.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **prototype pollution**
- **impact:** Denial of Service (DoS)
- **vector:** supplying a crafted payload
- **attacker:** attackers
- **product:** xe-utils
- **version:** v3.5.31
- **component:** lib.merge function

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper input validation when merging or setting properties, allowing an attacker to pollute the prototype chain. Specifically, the `lib.merge` and `lib.set` functions are vulnerable.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
Prototype Pollution

Impact of exploitation:
Denial of Service (DoS) at a minimum. Potential for injection-based attacks and arbitrary command execution if the polluted prototype propagates to sensitive Node.js APIs.

Attack vectors:
Supplying a payload with `Object.prototype` setter to the `lib.merge` or `lib.set` functions.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
An attacker needs to be able to control the input to the `lib.merge` or `lib.set` functions.

Mitigation or fix:
The advisory does not specify a fix, but implies updating the package would be necessary.

The content provides more detail than the official CVE description would likely contain, specifically the PoC and detailed explanation of impact.
