# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-4578

## Vulnerability Description
This Advisory describes an issue that impacts Arista Wireless Access Points. Any entity with the ability to authenticate via SSH to an affected AP as the config user is able to cause a privilege escalation via spawning a bash shell. The SSH CLI session does not require high permissions to exploit this vulnerability, but the config password is required to establish the session. The spawned shell is able to obtain root privileges.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** obtain root privileges and privilege escalation
- **vector:** spawning a bash shell
- **attacker:** entity with the ability to authenticate via SSH to an affected AP as the config user
- **product:** Arista Wireless Access Points

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-4578

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection'). Specifically, an authenticated user with the "config" role can inject arbitrary commands into the system via the SSH CLI, leading to privilege escalation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Command Injection (CWE-77):** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input when executing commands via the SSH CLI, allowing for command injection.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** A user with the "config" role, which has limited privileges in the SSH CLI, can leverage the command injection to spawn a bash shell with root privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Full System Compromise:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain root access on the affected Arista Wireless Access Point.
*   **Data and Configuration Manipulation:** With root access, an attacker could potentially steal data, modify configurations, disrupt network operations, or install malicious software.
*   **Loss of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:** The impact of a successful attack could lead to significant losses in all three of these areas.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network-Adjacent Attack (AV:A):** An attacker must be on the same network segment as the target access point or have access to it.
*   **SSH Access:** The attacker must gain access via SSH.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to reach the target access point on the network.
*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs the password for the "config" user on the access point to initiate the SSH session and exploit the command injection vulnerability.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** The attacker must be aware of this command injection vulnerability to be able to exploit it correctly.

**Additional details from the document:**
*   **Affected Devices:** All Arista WiFi Access Points
*   **Unaffected Devices:** Arista EOS-based products, CloudVision products, Arista 7130 Systems running MOS, Arista Converged Cloud Fabric, Arista NDR, Arista Edge Threat Management, Arista Netvisor OS.
*   **Indicators of Compromise (IOC):** Look for unusual command executions in the `/var/log/cli.log` file, specifically bash commands executed within CLI commands.
*   **Mitigation:** Use a strong password for the config shell and share it only with trusted parties.
*   **Resolution:** Upgrade to the specified fixed versions: 13.0.2-28-vv1101 or later (13.0.2.x train), 16.1.0-51-vv703 or later (16.1.0.x train).

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* 🔍 *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* 🔍 *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion – CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### 🔸 CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ✅ *“A user created with the ‘guest’ role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ✅ *“The backup service runs as root but only needs read access.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ⚠️ This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### 🔸 CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ✅ *“User can access another user’s invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.”*

## Mapping Examples – Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *“User can escalate privileges to admin.”*
> ❌ Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged – only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ✅ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**

## Good Mapping Examples – Privileges & Permissions

* ✅ **CWE-266**: *“When a new user registers, the system assigns them admin role due to a missing role validation.”*
* ✅ **CWE-250**: *“Installer runs with system-level privileges but doesn't require them to install files in the user directory.”*
* ✅ **CWE-284**: *“Inconsistent access rules between UI and backend for sensitive endpoints.”*
* ✅ **CWE-285**: *“Authorization logic fails to restrict access to finance reports based on department.”*
