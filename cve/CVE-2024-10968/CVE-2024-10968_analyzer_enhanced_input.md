## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- A SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `contact_process.php` file of the Bookstore Management System.
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization/validation of user input, specifically the `fnm` parameter, before using it in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application directly incorporates user-supplied input into SQL queries without proper sanitization, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL code.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The application fails to validate and filter the `fnm` parameter, enabling the injection of arbitrary SQL commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Database Access:** Attackers can gain access to the database without proper authorization.
- **Sensitive Data Leakage:** Attackers can retrieve sensitive information stored in the database.
- **Data Tampering:** Attackers can modify or delete data within the database.
- **System Control:** Attackers could potentially gain comprehensive control of the system.
- **Service Interruption:** Exploitation can lead to disruption of services.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered via a POST request to `contact_process.php`.
- **`fnm` Parameter:** The malicious SQL injection payload is injected through the `fnm` parameter within the POST request body.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated. The vulnerability is exploitable without prior login or authorization.
- The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable application endpoint.
- Basic knowledge of SQL and SQL injection is necessary to craft an effective exploit.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

- The vulnerability is a **time-based blind SQL injection**, meaning the attacker infers information based on the time taken by the database to execute queries.
- The provided PoC uses a `SLEEP()` function in the SQL payload to demonstrate the time-based injection.
- The content includes several screenshots of `sqlmap` output, showing how to exploit the vulnerability to:
    - Enumerate databases (`--dbs`)
    - Enumerate tables (`-D bms --tables`)
    - Enumerate columns (`-D bms -t admin --columns`)
    - Dump data (`-D bms -T admin -C a_fnm --dump` and `-D bms -T admin -C a_pwd --dump`).

- The suggested repair techniques are:
    - Using prepared statements and parameter binding
    - Input validation and filtering
    - Minimizing database user permissions
    - Regular security audits
