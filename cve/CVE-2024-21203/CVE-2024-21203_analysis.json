While CWE-400 is a broader category, the description specifies a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, which is a direct consequence of uncontrolled resource consumption. CWE-770 offers a more specific description by focusing on the **allocation of resources** without limits or throttling, suggesting this is the root cause of the vulnerability. CWE-NVD-noinfo was also considered, but it provides no actionable information for classification.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cweNVD[\"CWE-NVD-noinfo: NVD Provided Information Withdrawn or Unavailable\"]\n\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe770 primary\n    class cwe400 secondary\n    class cweNVD tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **uncontrolled allocation of resources** (CWE-770), leading to **resource exhaustion** (CWE-400), and ultimately resulting in a **denial-of-service** (DoS) condition where the MySQL Server hangs or crashes.\n\nCWE-770 (Root Cause) -> CWE-400 (Impact) -> Denial of Service\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the reported impact: a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. The primary evidence supporting this is the phrase \"cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS) of MySQL Server.\" The \"CWE for similar CVE Descriptions\" section suggests CWE-NVD-noinfo as the primary match, however, this provides no actionable information, and per mapping guidelines, should not be used if more information is available.\n\nThe Retriever results suggested several CWEs, but CWE-770 stood out due to its focus on **uncontrolled allocation of resources**, which aligns with potential causes of DoS. This is further supported by the \"Complete CWE Specifications\" for CWE-770, indicating it's a base-level weakness related to resource management. The relationship to CWE-400, a broader class encompassing resource consumption issues, further solidifies the choice of CWE-770 as the primary root cause, with CWE-400 representing the resulting impact.\n\nThe final selection reflects the available evidence, emphasizing the root cause (CWE-770) and the resulting impact (CWE-400). CWE-770 is at the optimal level of specificity (Base) as it directly addresses the **allocation of resources** without proper limits, leading to the observed DoS.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-129: Improper Validation of Array Index\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses untrusted input when calculating or using an array index, but the product does not validate or incorrectly validates the index to ensure the index references a valid position within the array.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*This CWE was not selected, as there is no mention of array indexing.*\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*This CWE was not selected, as there is no mention of authentication algorithms.*\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.

While CWE-400 is a broader category, the description specifies a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, which is a direct consequence of uncontrolled resource consumption. CWE-770 offers a more specific description by focusing on the **allocation of resources** without limits or throttling, suggesting this is the root cause of the vulnerability. CWE-NVD-noinfo was also considered, but it provides no actionable information for classification.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cweNVD[\"CWE-NVD-noinfo: NVD Provided Information Withdrawn or Unavailable\"]\n\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe770 primary\n    class cwe400 secondary\n    class cweNVD tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **uncontrolled allocation of resources** (CWE-770), leading to **resource exhaustion** (CWE-400), and ultimately resulting in a **denial-of-service** (DoS) condition where the MySQL Server hangs or crashes.\n\nCWE-770 (Root Cause) -> CWE-400 (Impact) -> Denial of Service\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the reported impact: a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. The primary evidence supporting this is the phrase \"cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS) of MySQL Server.\" The \"CWE for similar CVE Descriptions\" section suggests CWE-NVD-noinfo as the primary match, however, this provides no actionable information, and per mapping guidelines, should not be used if more information is available.\n\nThe Retriever results suggested several CWEs, but CWE-770 stood out due to its focus on **uncontrolled allocation of resources**, which aligns with potential causes of DoS. This is further supported by the \"Complete CWE Specifications\" for CWE-770, indicating it's a base-level weakness related to resource management. The relationship to CWE-400, a broader class encompassing resource consumption issues, further solidifies the choice of CWE-770 as the primary root cause, with CWE-400 representing the resulting impact.\n\nThe final selection reflects the available evidence, emphasizing the root cause (CWE-770) and the resulting impact (CWE-400). CWE-770 is at the optimal level of specificity (Base) as it directly addresses the **allocation of resources** without proper limits, leading to the observed DoS.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-129: Improper Validation of Array Index\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses untrusted input when calculating or using an array index, but the product does not validate or incorrectly validates the index to ensure the index references a valid position within the array.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*This CWE was not selected, as there is no mention of array indexing.*\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*This CWE was not selected, as there is no mention of authentication algorithms.*\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.
