CWE-639 is a base level CWE, making it more specific. CWE-862 is related as a more general form of authorization failure, being a class level CWE, and a parent of CWE-425 Direct Request ('Forced Browsing'). CWE-425 is a child of CWE-862.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe425[\"CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\"]\n    \n    cwe425 -->|CHILDOF| cwe862\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe639 primary\n    class cwe862 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **missing validation on a user controlled key** (CWE-639), leading to an **Insecure Direct Object Reference**, allowing authenticated attackers to **extract information from posts**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is the **missing validation on a user controlled key** which allows for the bypass of authorization.\n\nThe vulnerability description clearly states the root cause as **missing validation on a user controlled key**. This directly aligns with CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key). The description highlights that an attacker can use a user-controlled key to access unauthorized data.\n\nCWE-862 (Missing Authorization) was also considered, but it is a broader category. Since the vulnerability involves a user-controlled key, CWE-639 is a more specific and accurate representation of the root cause. The retriever results also show a high score for CWE-639.\n\nBased on the retriever results, the vulnerability description, and the CWE specifications, CWE-639 is the most appropriate primary CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**CWE-639 Technical Explanation:**\n- **How the vulnerability's details match the CWE's characteristics:** The vulnerability description indicates that the application **does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data**.
