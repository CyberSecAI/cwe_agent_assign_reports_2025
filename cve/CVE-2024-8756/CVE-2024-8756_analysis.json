  "description": "The Quform - WordPress Form Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to **Sensitive Information Exposure** in all versions up to, and including, 2.20.0 via the saveUploadedFile function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to extract sensitive data, such as Personally Identifiable Information, from files uploaded by users. Files uploaded via forms created before version 2.21.0 will remain vulnerable to exposure after upgrading. To fully patch the plugin, site administrators should download any previously uploaded files, delete previously existing files and forms, and create the forms again after upgrading to version 2.21.0.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2024-8756:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\n- The vulnerability lies within the `saveUploadedFile` function of the Quform WordPress plugin. This function does not properly restrict access to uploaded files, leading to potential exposure.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n- **Unauthenticated Sensitive Information Exposure:** The primary vulnerability is that unauthenticated attackers can access and retrieve sensitive information from files uploaded through the Quform plugin. This is due to the lack of proper access controls on the uploaded files.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n- **Exposure of Personally Identifiable Information (PII):** Attackers can potentially gain access to sensitive data, including PII, contained within the uploaded files.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n- **Network-based attack:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability remotely through HTTP requests.\n- **Unauthenticated Access:** Attackers do not require any authentication to exploit this vulnerability, making it easier to target vulnerable sites.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n- Attackers need to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress instance.\n- No specific user roles or privileges are needed. An attacker can exploit the vulnerability without any valid credentials.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n- The vulnerability affects all versions of the plugin up to and including version 2.20.0.\n- Files uploaded through forms created before version 2.21.0 remain vulnerable even after upgrading to version 2.21.0. To fully patch the vulnerability, administrators must download and delete previously uploaded files and forms, and re-create the forms after updating.\n- The vulnerability was discovered by shaman0x01 of the Shaman Red Team.\n- The vendor patched the vulnerability in version 2.21.0\n\nThe provided content gives details that are not available in the CVE description, such as the specific vulnerable function `saveUploadedFile`, the specific attack vector (unauthenticated access via HTTP requests), and the required steps to fully mitigate the vulnerability.",

Since the description specifies a **missing** authentication, the more specific CWE-306 was selected. Also, the relationships between CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) and CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data) where the sensitive information is exposed after being sent helped refine the secondary weakness. I avoided higher-level classes like CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) and CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) to favor the more descriptive base-level CWEs.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe201 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe306 primary\n    class cwe201 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **missing authentication** for the `saveUploadedFile` function (CWE-306), which allows unauthenticated attackers to access uploaded files. This leads to **sensitive information** being included in the data that is sent to the attacker (CWE-201), resulting in the **exposure of sensitive information** (the impact), such as PII.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary classification is CWE-306 because the root cause of the vulnerability is the **missing authentication** for a critical function (`saveUploadedFile`). This allows unauthenticated access to sensitive files. The vulnerability description clearly states that \"unauthenticated attackers can extract sensitive data... from files uploaded by users,\" which strongly supports CWE-306. The secondary classification is CWE-201 because this **sensitive information** is directly inserted into the data being sent to the attacker.\n\nCWE-434 (Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type) was considered but not selected because the issue isn't primarily about the *type* of file uploaded, but rather the lack of access control. CWE-425 (Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')) and CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) were also considered, but CWE-306 is a more specific representation of the root cause: the complete absence of authentication. CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) was considered but CWE-201 fits better because this **sensitive information** is directly inserted into the data being sent to the attacker.\n\nThe selection of CWE-306 and CWE-201 provides the most accurate and specific representation of the vulnerability based on the available evidence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n#
