# Analysis Report for CVE-2024-46999

# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-46999

## Description

Zitadel is an open source identity management platform. **ZITADELs user grants deactivation mechanism did not work correctly**. Deactivated user grants were still provided in token, which could lead to unauthorized access to applications and resources. Additionally, the management and auth API always returned the state as active or did not provide any information about the state. Versions 2.62.1, 2.61.1, 2.60.2, 2.59.3, 2.58.5, 2.57.5, 2.56.6, 2.55.8, and 2.54.10 have been released which address this issue. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may explicitly remove the user grants to make sure the user does not get access anymore.

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-863 | Incorrect Authorization | 0.9 | Class | Primary | Allowed-with-Review |
| CWE-306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | 0.7 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship influencing the CWE selection is the hierarchical one. CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) is a class-level CWE, while CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) is a base-level CWE. While a more specific CWE is generally preferred, CWE-863 captures the overall authorization failure more accurately as the core issue. CWE-306 is a potential contributing factor, as the **failure** to properly deactivate user grants effectively leads to a form of **missing** authentication for those grants.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **incorrectly implemented user grant deactivation mechanism**, leading to deactivated user grants being included in tokens. This, in turn, results in unauthorized access to applications and resources.

Incorrect User Grant Deactivation Mechanism -> Deactivated User Grants in Tokens -> Unauthorized Access

## Summary of Analysis
The primary weakness is that the deactivation mechanism for user grants did not work correctly. The system continued to issue tokens with permissions that should have been revoked. This is primarily an **authorization** issue (CWE-863). While authentication might seem relevant, the core problem is that the system **failed to properly authorize** access based on the deactivation status.

Evidence:
- "**ZITADELs user grants deactivation mechanism did not work correctly**"
- "Deactivated user grants were still provided in token, which could lead to unauthorized access to applications and resources."

CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) is the most appropriate because it directly addresses the **failure** to correctly perform the authorization check, leading to unauthorized access.

CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) is considered a secondary weakness because the **failure** to properly deactivate grants effectively means that authentication wasn't being properly enforced for those deactivated grants.

Other CWEs Considered:

*   CWE-285 (Improper Authorization): This is a higher-level class and less specific than CWE-863. It's also discouraged.
*   CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key): This is not applicable because the vulnerability does not involve user-controlled keys.
*   CWE-288 (Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel): This is not applicable because there isn't an alternate path or channel being exploited.
*   CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data): This is not applicable because the vulnerability isn't directly about inserting sensitive information, but rather about **incorrectly** providing access.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication
**Abstraction Level**: Class
