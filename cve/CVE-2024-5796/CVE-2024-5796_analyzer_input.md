# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-5796

## Vulnerability Description
The Infinite theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the project_url parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.2 due to **insufficient input sanitization and output escaping**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-5796:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the `project_url` parameter within the Infinite theme for WordPress.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The theme fails to properly sanitize the `project_url` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code. This code is then stored in the database and executed when a user views the affected page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary web scripts. These scripts execute in the context of the user's browser when they view a page containing the injected code.
- **Potential for Various Malicious Activities:** This can lead to a range of malicious activities, including:
    - Stealing session cookies
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Defacing the website
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered via the `project_url` parameter.
- The injected script is stored, allowing for persistent execution on page views.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least Contributor-level access to the WordPress site. This indicates that the attacker needs to have an account on the target WordPress site with specific roles assigned to it.
- **Ability to Modify Post/Page Content:** The attacker needs the ability to modify content where the `project_url` parameter is used within the theme's metaboxes.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects all versions of the Infinite theme up to and including version 1.1.2.
- There is no known patch available for this vulnerability, suggesting that the theme developers have not released an update addressing this issue.
