- **vector:** manipulation of old_image argument
- **product:** Codezips Online Institute Management System
- **version:** up to 1.0
- **component:** /profile.php

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content is related to CVE-2024-10765.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of input validation and sanitization in the `profile.php` file of the "Codezips Online Institute Management System". Specifically, the code directly uses the `$_FILES` input to determine the storage location of uploaded files without any checks or cleaning.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Unrestricted file upload: The system allows users to upload files without proper validation, making it vulnerable to various attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- File overwrite: Attackers could potentially overwrite existing files.
- File injection: Malicious files could be injected into the system.
- Directory traversal: Attackers could potentially traverse the directory structure to access sensitive information or write files in arbitrary locations.
- Denial of service: By uploading large files or a large number of files, an attacker could exhaust resources and cause a denial-of-service.
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): By uploading and then accessing malicious files (e.g., PHP scripts), attackers could achieve remote code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through the file upload functionality in `profile.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to access and use the file upload functionality of the vulnerable application. No special privileges are mentioned but they probably require an account.
- The attacker can be remote as the vulnerability exists through the file upload feature accessible over HTTP.
