  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ubifs authentication Fix ****use-after-free**** in ubifs_tnc_end_commit After an insertion in TNC, the tree might split and cause a node to change its `znode->parent`. A further deletion of other nodes in the tree (which also could free the nodes), the aforementioned nodes `znode->cparent` could still point to a freed node. This `znode->cparent` may not be updated when getting nodes to commit in `ubifs_tnc_start_commit()`. This could then trigger a ****use-after-free**** when accessing the `znode->cparent` in `write_index()` in `ubifs_tnc_end_commit()`. This can be triggered by running rm -f /etc/test-file.bin dd if=/dev/urandom of=/etc/test-file.bin bs=1M count=60 conv=fsync in a loop, and with `CONFIG_UBIFS_FS_AUTHENTICATION`.

More specifically, consider the following TNC zroot / / zp1 / / zn Inserting a new node `zn_new` with a key smaller then `zn` will trigger a split in `tnc_insert()` if `zp1` is full zroot / \\\\ / \\\\ zp1 zp2 / \\\\ / \\\\ zn_new zn `zn->parent` has now been moved to `zp2`, *but* `zn->cparent` still points to `zp1`. Now, consider a removal of all the nodes _except_ `zn`. Just when `tnc_delete()` is about to delete `zroot` and `zp2` zroot \\\\ \\\\ zp2 \\\\ \\\\ zn `zroot` and `zp2` get freed and the tree collapses zn `zn` now becomes the new `zroot`. `get_znodes_to_commit()` will now only find `zn`, the new `zroot`, and `write_index()` will check its `znode->cparent` that wrongly points to the already freed `zp1`. `ubifs_copy_hash()` thus gets wrongly called with `znode->cparent->zbranch[znode->iip].hash` that triggers the ****use-after-free****! Fix this by explicitly setting `znode->cparent` to `NULL` in `get_znodes_to_commit()` for the root node. The search for the dirty nodes ---truncated---",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe root cause of this vulnerability is a use-after-free in the `ubifs_tnc_end_commit` function within the UBIFS file system when authentication is enabled (`CONFIG_UBIFS_FS_AUTHENTICATION`). This occurs due to a mismatch between the parent and child pointers in the TNC (Tree Node Cache) after tree splits and node deletions.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Use-After-Free:** The primary vulnerability is a use-after-free. After a TNC insertion and subsequent splits, a node\u2019s `znode->cparent` pointer may still point to a freed node due to the parent pointer not being updated. This leads to accessing freed memory when `ubifs_copy_hash` attempts to access hash data through this dangling pointer.\n- **Incorrect Parent Pointer Handling:** The vulnerability stems from the incorrect handling of the `cparent` pointer during TNC node updates and deletions. This occurs during tree splits, where `znode->parent` gets updated, but `znode->cparent` is not.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Kernel Crash:** The use-after-free causes a kernel crash, as KASAN reports a memory access violation. This can lead to a denial-of-service condition.\n- **Potential Code Execution:** While not explicitly stated, use-after-free vulnerabilities can sometimes be leveraged for more severe attacks if the freed memory is subsequently reallocated with attacker-controlled data. This could potentially lead to code execution.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **File System Operations:** The vulnerability is triggered by performing file system operations on a UBIFS volume with authentication enabled, particularly through a specific sequence of file creations, writes, and deletions.\n- **Specifically crafted loop:** The provided test case involves repeatedly removing a test file, writing random data to it, and syncing the file system. This triggers the TNC manipulations that expose the vulnerability.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Local User:** The attacker needs to be a local user with the ability to mount and perform file system operations on a UBIFS partition.\n- **UBIFS with Authentication Enabled:** The vulnerability requires the UBIFS file system to be mounted with authentication enabled (`CONFIG_UBIFS_FS_AUTHENTICATION`).\n\n**Technical Details and Explanation:**\n1. **TNC Tree Structure:**\n   The TNC is a tree-like structure used for indexing file system metadata in UBIFS. Each node (znode) has pointers to its parent (`znode->parent`) and a cached parent (`znode->cparent`).\n2. **Tree Splits and Parent Changes:**\n   - During insertion, if a znode's parent (zp1) is full, a tree split occurs.\n   - This split results in a new sibling node (zp2), and some of the child nodes move to the new sibling.\n   - The `znode->parent` pointer is updated to the new node. However, `znode->cparent` is left pointing to the old parent.\n3. **Node Deletion and Tree Collapse:**\n   - If all other nodes are deleted except the target node (zn), the TNC tree collapses, and zn becomes the new root.\n   - The `znode->cparent` of the new root zn still points to a freed memory location (the old parent zp1).\n4. **Vulnerability Trigger:**\n   - In `get_znodes_to_commit()`, which is responsible for finding dirty nodes to commit, the code does not update `znode->cparent` for root nodes when it becomes root.\n   - In `ubifs_tnc_end_commit()`, when `write_index()` calls `ubifs_copy_hash()` using the dangling `znode->cparent`, it results in a use-after-free as it tries to access `znode->cparent->zbranch[znode->iip].hash`, which is now freed memory.\n\n**Patch/Fix:**\nThe fix addresses this issue by explicitly setting `znode->cparent` to `NULL` in `get_znodes_to_commit()` when the current node is identified as the root node of the TNC. This prevents the use of the dangling pointer and the associated use-after-free vulnerability.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The content provides detailed crash traces from Kernel Address Sanitizer (KASAN) which confirms the vulnerability.\n- This vulnerability was introduced by the commit `16a26b20d2af` which added hashes to the index nodes.\n- The provided test case can easily be used to verify the bug.\n- The fix includes an assertion to verify that the current node indeed has no parent when setting the `cparent` pointer to `NULL`.",

This `znode->cparent` may not be updated when getting nodes to commit in `ubifs_tnc_start_commit()`. This could then trigger a **use-after-free** when accessing the `znode->cparent` in `write_index()` in `ubifs_tnc_end_commit()`.\" This directly supports the selection of **CWE-416 (Use After Free)** as the primary weakness.\n\nThe CVE Reference Links Content Summary further clarifies the root cause: \"The **root cause** of this vulnerability is a **use-after-free** in the `ubifs_tnc_end_commit` function within the UBIFS file system when authentication is enabled (`CONFIG_UBIFS_FS_AUTHENTICATION`). This occurs due to a mismatch between the parent and child pointers in the TNC (Tree Node Cache) after tree splits and node deletions.\"\n\nOther CWEs Considered:\n\n*   **CWE-401 (Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime):** While memory is involved, the issue isn't a general memory leak but a specific use-after-free scenario.\n*   **CWE-415 (Double Free):** This is a different type of memory corruption vulnerability.\n*   **CWE-364 (Signal Handler Race Condition):** This is not directly related to signal handling.\n*   **CWE-59 (Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following'))** and **CWE-41 (Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence):** These are file system related issues but not the root cause here.\n*   **CWE-667 (Improper Locking):** While concurrency is involved, the root cause isn't a locking issue but a use-after-free.\n*   **CWE-123 (Write-what-where Condition):** While the vulnerability could potentially lead to writing arbitrary data, the direct cause is use-after-free.\n```\n\n\n## CWE Relationship Analysis\n\nCurrent CWEs represent these abstraction levels: .\n\n\n### Vulnerability Chain Analysis\n\n**Chain starting from CWE-123:**\n- 123 (Write-what-where Condition) - ROOT\n\n\n**Chain starting from CWE-416:**\n- 416 (Use After Free) - ROOT\n\n\n\n### CWE Relationship Diagram\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n```",
