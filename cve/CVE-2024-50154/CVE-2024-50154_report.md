# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-50154

## Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved tcp/dccp Dont use timer_pending() in reqsk_queue_unlink(). Martin KaFai Lau reported use-after-free [0] in reqsk_timer_handler(). We are seeing a use-after-free from a bpf prog attached to trace_tcp_retransmit_synack. The program passes the req->sk to the bpf_sk_storage_get_tracing kernel helper which does check for null before using it. The commit 83fccfc3940c (inet fix potential deadlock in reqsk_queue_unlink()) added timer_pending() in reqsk_queue_unlink() not to call del_timer_sync() from reqsk_timer_handler(), but it introduced a small race window. Before the timer is called, expire_timers() calls detach_timer(timer, true) to clear timer->entry.pprev and marks it as not pending. If reqsk_queue_unlink() checks timer_pending() just after expire_timers() calls detach_timer(), TCP will miss del_timer_sync() the reqsk timer will continue running and send multiple SYN+ACKs until it expires. The reported UAF could happen if req->sk is close()d earlier than the timer expiration, which is 63s by default. The scenario would be 1. inet_csk_complete_hashdance() calls inet_csk_reqsk_queue_drop(), but del_timer_sync() is missed 2. reqsk timer is executed and scheduled again 3. req->sk is accept()ed and reqsk_put() decrements rsk_refcnt, but reqsk timer still has another one, and inet_csk_accept() does not clear req->sk for non-TFO sockets 4. sk is close()d 5. reqsk timer is executed again, and BPF touches req->sk Lets not use timer_pending() by passing the caller context to __inet_csk_reqsk_queue_drop(). Note that reqsk timer is pinned, so the issue does not happen in most use cases.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Rootcause:** The commit 83fccfc3940c introduced a race condition by using timer_pending() in reqsk_queue_unlink(), which could lead to missing del_timer_sync() calls, and subsequently, a use-after-free.
- **Weakness:** Race condition in timer handling within reqsk_queue_unlink(). The check for timer_pending() can return an incorrect value if it happens immediately after detach_timer(), leading to the timer not being properly cancelled. The use of a bpf prog attached to trace_tcp_retransmit_synack triggers the bug.
- **Impact:** Use-after-free vulnerability, which could lead to system instability or crash. The vulnerability is triggered if the req->sk is close()d before the timer expires, causing the BPF program to access the freed memory.
- **Vector:** The vulnerability is triggered through the TCP stack when a connection is established using SYN cookies (TFO sockets may not clear req->sk). Specifically, during retransmission of SYN+ACK when a bpf program is attached to trace_tcp_retransmit_synack.
- **Attacker:** An attacker could trigger the vulnerability by establishing multiple TCP connections and forcing retransmissions of SYN-ACKs, eventually triggering the race condition which leads to the UAF.
- **Product:** Linux Kernel
- **Version:** Likely present in versions with commit 83fccfc3940c and before the fix
- **Component:** TCP/IP Stack, specifically the reqsk timer and related functions (reqsk_queue_unlink, reqsk_timer_handler, inet_csk_complete_hashdance, inet_csk_reqsk_queue_drop, etc)

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-367 | Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition | 0.9 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-416 | Use After Free | 0.8 | Variant | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is a **Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition (CWE-367)**. The race condition is between the timer being detached and the check to see if the timer is pending. This leads to the timer potentially not being deleted and eventually accessing the memory after it has been freed. The **Use After Free (CWE-416)** is a consequence of the race condition.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with a race condition when checking if the timer is pending.
1.  Race condition in timer handling (`reqsk_queue_unlink()`) - **CWE-367**
2.  Timer is not properly cancelled because of the race condition
3.  Socket is closed
4.  Timer expires and accesses freed memory, resulting in a use-after-free - **CWE-416**

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment identified a **race condition** as the root cause, leading to a **use-after-free**. The evidence strongly supports these findings.

The vulnerability description explicitly states: "**The commit 83fccfc3940c introduced a race condition by using timer_pending() in reqsk_queue_unlink(), which could lead to missing del_timer_sync() calls, and subsequently, a use-after-free.**"

The **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** further reinforces this: "The vulnerability stems from a race condition introduced by the commit `83fccfc3940c`... This commit added a check using `timer_pending()`... However, a race window exists where `reqsk_queue_unlink()` might check `timer_pending()` immediately after `expire_timers()` calls `detach_timer()`... causing `del_timer_sync()` to be skipped." and "Exploitation results in a use-after-free condition when a BPF program attached to `trace_tcp_retransmit_synack` tries to access the freed socket via `req->sk`.".

The graph relationships and retriever results helped to narrow down the specific type of race condition and confirm the **use-after-free** as a consequence.

CWE-367 is the most specific and appropriate representation of the race condition, and CWE-416 accurately describes the resulting use-after-free.

**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check. This can cause the product to perform invalid actions when the resource is in an unexpected state.
