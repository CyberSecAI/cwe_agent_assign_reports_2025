## Analysis of CVE-2025-5056 Content

This content is **RELEVANT** to CVE-2025-5056. It provides a detailed vulnerability report for the "Online Shopping Portal V1.0" application, specifically focusing on a SQL injection vulnerability in the `/admin/edit-products.php` file. Here's a breakdown of the extracted information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient user input validation of the 'category' parameter in the `/admin/edit-products.php` file. Malicious code injected into this parameter is directly used in SQL queries without proper cleaning or validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   SQL Injection

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Unauthorized database access
*   Sensitive data leakage
*   Data tampering
*   Comprehensive system control
*   Service interruption

**Attack vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is exploitable via the 'category' parameter in a POST request to `/admin/edit-products.php`.
*   No login or authorization is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to send crafted POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint. No authentication is required.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   **Use prepared statements and parameter binding:** This separates SQL code from user input.
*   **Input validation and filtering:**  Strictly validate and filter user input.
*   **Minimize database user permissions:** Use accounts with the minimum necessary privileges.
*   **Regular security audits:** Conduct regular code and system security audits.

**Additional Details (More than official CVE description):**

*   **Affected Product:** campcodes Online Shopping Portal V1.0
*   **Vulnerable File:** `/admin/edit-products.php`
*   **Payload Example:** A sample payload using time-based blind SQL injection is provided.
