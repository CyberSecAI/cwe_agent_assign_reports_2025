  "description": "The eMagicOne Store Manager for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to **arbitrary file uploads** due to **missing file type validation** in the set_image() function in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.5. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected sites server which may make remote code execution possible. This is only exploitable by unauthenticated attackers in **default configurations** where the the **default password** is left as 11, or where the attacker gains access to the credentials.",

  "reference_content": "Here's an analysis of the provided content based on your guidelines:\n\n**1. Verifying Content Relation to CVE-2025-5058:**\n\n*   The content directly relates to CVE-2025-5058. It describes the eMagicOne Store Manager for WooCommerce plugin vulnerability, as per the CVE description.\n\n**2. Extracting Vulnerability Information:**\n\n*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin's remote management protocol endpoint (`?connector=bridge`) allows file uploads to the server. The vulnerability lies in the default credential pair (`login=1`, `password=1`) and the session key system, which, if unchanged, allows an attacker to authenticate, obtain a session key, and upload arbitrary files. The `set_image` task is specifically mentioned as the attack vector.\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unauthenticated arbitrary file upload due to the use of default credentials and a flawed session key implementation. Path traversal is also a possibility, as `image_id` is used to construct the destination path.\n*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can upload arbitrary files, including PHP shells, to the WordPress root or any writable directory. This could lead to complete site compromise.\n*   **Attack vectors:** The primary attack vector is sending a POST request to the `?connector=bridge` endpoint with the correct hash and a crafted `set_image` task.\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to know the existence of the plugin, the `?connector=bridge` endpoint, and the default credentials. The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests with multipart/form-data.\n*   **Mitigation or fix:** The content does not provide mitigation or fix.\n\n**3. Additional Detail than CVE Description:**\n\n*   Yes, this content provides significantly more detail than the standard CVE description, including the vulnerable code snippets, relevant code lines, and a Python proof-of-concept (POC) exploit.",

The vulnerability is further exacerbated by the use of a **default password**, allowing unauthenticated attackers to exploit the **missing file type validation**. This introduces authentication and credential-related CWEs, specifically CWE-306 and CWE-259. These CWEs are related but represent different aspects of the overall vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe434[\"CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe259[\"CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password\"]\n\n    cwe434\n    cwe306\n    cwe259\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe434 primary\n    class cwe306,cwe259 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **missing file type validation (CWE-434)**, which enables **arbitrary file uploads**. This is compounded by either a **missing authentication (CWE-306)** or the use of a **default password (CWE-259)**, allowing unauthenticated attackers to upload malicious files. The final impact is potential **remote code execution**.\n\nCWE-434 (Root Cause) -> Arbitrary File Upload -> CWE-306/CWE-259 -> Remote Code Execution\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-434 because the root cause of the vulnerability is the **missing file type validation**, which allows **unrestricted file uploads**. The use of a **default password** allows unauthenticated attackers to exploit the **missing file type validation**. This default configuration makes the system more vulnerable. The presence of a **default password** (CWE-259) and the possibility of **missing authentication** (CWE-306) are contributing factors.\n\nCWE-434 directly addresses the file upload issue, while CWE-306 and CWE-259 address the authentication bypass. The relationships between these CWEs highlight how multiple weaknesses can combine to create a more severe vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following
