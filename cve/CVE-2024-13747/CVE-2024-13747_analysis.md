# Analysis for CVE-2024-13747

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-862 | Missing Authorization | 1.0 | Class | Primary | Allowed-with-Review |
| CWE-89 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') | 1.0 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is CWE-862 [Missing Authorization], which is a Class-level CWE. A more specific Base-level CWE related to authorization would be ideal, but in this case, the description focuses on the absence of any authorization check rather than an incorrect one. CWE-89 [Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')] is a consequence of the missing authorization, as the lack of access control allows attackers to inject SQL commands. CWE-862 is a parent of CWE-425 [Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')], which could be considered if the vulnerability involved direct access to restricted resources, but the SQL injection aspect makes CWE-89 a more relevant secondary CWE.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **missing capability check** (CWE-862 [Missing Authorization]). Because there is no check, authenticated users with low privileges can then inject SQL (CWE-89 [Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')]), leading to unauthorized data loss.

## Summary of Analysis
The primary root cause is the **missing capability check**, which directly translates to CWE-862 [Missing Authorization]. The vulnerability description clearly states this **missing capability check** on the `template_delete_saved` function. The resulting **SQL injection** vulnerability is a consequence of this **missing authorization**, making CWE-89 [Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')] a secondary weakness.

The evidence is:
*   "**missing capability check** on the template_delete_saved function"
*   "This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to inject SQL into an existing post deletion query."

CWE-862 [Missing Authorization] is chosen as the primary CWE because it represents the fundamental flaw that enables the vulnerability. CWE-89 [Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')] is a direct result of the **missing authorization** and is therefore a secondary concern. Other CWEs, such as CWE-352 [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)] and CWE-306 [Missing Authentication for Critical Function], were considered but deemed less relevant as the vulnerability is about authorization and **SQL injection**, not CSRF or a complete lack of authentication.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
**Abstraction Level**: Compound
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.



## CWE-359: Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly prevent a person's private, personal information from being accessed by actors who either (1) are not explicitly authorized to access the information or (2) do not have the implicit consent of the person about whom the information is collected.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.67
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.67
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.66
