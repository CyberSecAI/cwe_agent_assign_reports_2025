# Analysis Report for CVE-2024-12544

# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-12544

## Description

The SurveyJS Drag & Drop WordPress Form Builder to create, style and embed multiple forms of any complexity plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to a **missing capability check** on the callback function of the SurveyJS_DeleteFile class in all versions up to, and including, 1.12.17. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php). This function is still vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery as of 1.12.20.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Component:** callback function of the SurveyJS_DeleteFile class
- **Rootcause:** missing capability check
- **Weakness:** cross-site scripting
- **Product:** SurveyJS Drag & Drop WordPress Form Builder
- **Impact:** arbitrary file deletion, remote code execution
- **Attacker:** authenticated attackers with Subscriber-level access and above
- **Version:** all versions up to and including 1.12.17

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-284 | Improper Access Control | 0.9 | Class | Primary | Allowed-with-Review |
| CWE-352 | Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) | 0.7 | Compound | Secondary | Allowed |
| CWE-22 | Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') | 0.6 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is the **missing capability check**, which falls under the broader category of **Improper Access Control**. CWE-284 is a Class-level CWE, and while more specific Base or Variant CWEs under it might exist, the provided information does not offer enough detail to pinpoint a more precise weakness. The vulnerability also demonstrates a potential Path Traversal issue due to the lack of input sanitization and a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability, indicating possible chaining or related weaknesses.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with a **missing capability check** (**CWE-284**), which allows unauthorized users (Subscriber-level access and above) to attempt to delete files. If successful, this leads to arbitrary file deletion, potentially resulting in remote code execution. There's also a potential for Path Traversal (**CWE-22**) because of the lack of sanitization and a Cross-Site Request Forgery (**CWE-352**)

## Summary of Analysis
Based on the available evidence, the primary weakness is the **missing capability check** on the callback function of the SurveyJS_DeleteFile class. The description explicitly states that this makes it possible for authenticated attackers to delete arbitrary files. This aligns with **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)**, as the system fails to restrict access to a sensitive function based on user privileges.

Additionally, the description mentions that the function is still vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery, suggesting **CWE-352** as a secondary weakness. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary shows the introduction of `sanitize_file_name()`, pointing to a potential for **CWE-22 (Path Traversal)**.

The selection of **CWE-284** is primarily based on the explicit mention of the **missing capability check** in the vulnerability description. The other CWEs are included as secondary weaknesses, as the description and CVE Reference Links Content Summary suggest their presence.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
**Abstraction Level**: Compound
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.

## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
