## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability classified as problematic was found in Netis WF-2404 1.1.124EN. Affected by this vulnerability is an unknown functionality of the component BusyBox Shell. The manipulation leads to **cleartext storage of sensitive information**. It is possible to launch the attack on the physical device. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation appears to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **cleartext storage of sensitive information**
- **impact:** cleartext storage of sensitive information
- **product:** Netis WF-2404
- **version:** 1.1.124EN
- **component:** BusyBox Shell

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The content relates to potential vulnerabilities in the Netis WF-2404 router. It details a method to change the default credentials via a UART shell and the `flash` command.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the presence of a UART shell running with root privileges without authentication, combined with a hidden `flash` command that allows direct modification of sensitive parameters.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Unauthenticated UART shell access with root privileges.
*   Hidden `flash` command allowing modification of persistent parameters.
*   Default credentials are easily crackable and publicly known.
*   Lack of password hashing (passwords stored in cleartext).
*   Lack of physical security hardening.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can gain full control of the router by changing credentials, potentially allowing for remote access and further exploitation. The `flash` command provides a direct avenue for payload testing and modification of firmware parameters.

**Attack vectors:**
*   Physical access to the router.
*   Connection to the UART interface.
*   Use of the `flash` command to modify credentials.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   Physical access to the router.
*   Ability to connect to and interact with the UART interface (requires soldering skills and appropriate hardware).
*   Knowledge of the `flash` command and its parameters.

**Mitigation or fix:**
*   Implement authentication for the UART shell.
*   Remove or restrict access to the `flash` command.
*   Hash passwords instead of storing them in cleartext.
*   Implement physical security measures to prevent unauthorized access to the UART interface.

**Note:** This content provides more detail than a typical CVE description, detailing the specific steps and commands used to exploit the vulnerability.
