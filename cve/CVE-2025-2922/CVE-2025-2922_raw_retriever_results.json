  "query": "A vulnerability classified as problematic was found in Netis WF-2404 1.1.124EN. Affected by this vulnerability is an unknown functionality of the component BusyBox Shell. The manipulation leads to cleartext storage of sensitive information. It is possible to launch the attack on the physical device. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation appears to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",
