CWE-352 is a compound weakness, and CWE-79 is a base weakness. CWE-79 is often caused by **improper neutralization of input**, which can be triggered via a **CSRF** attack in this case.

This leads to **CWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')]**, as the injected input is not properly neutralized, resulting in **stored XSS**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis indicates a high confidence in assigning CWE-352 and CWE-79. The vulnerability description clearly states that the **root cause** is a **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**, leading to a **stored XSS vulnerability**.\n\nEvidence:\n- \"**Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** vulnerability in affmngr Affiliates Manager Google reCAPTCHA Integration allows Stored XSS.\"\n- \"**rootcause:** **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**\"\n- \"**weakness:** **stored XSS**\"\n\nCWE-352 directly matches the stated **root cause**.
