CWE-285 was considered due to the potential for authorization bypass, but input validation seems to be the initial **weakness**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe20 primary\n    class cwe285 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of **weakness** starts with **Improper Input Validation** (CWE-20), potentially leading to a security feature bypass and affecting page integrity. The chain is:\n\nCWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) -> Security Feature Bypass -> Page Integrity Impact\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description indicates an **Improper Input Validation** that leads to a security feature bypass and affects the integrity of the page. The primary **weakness** is the **lack of proper input validation**, which allows a low-privileged attacker to slightly affect page integrity.\n\nThe selection of CWE-20 is based on the explicit mention of \"**Improper Input Validation**\" in the vulnerability description. While other CWEs like CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) are considered due to the \"security feature bypass\" impact, the root cause points towards input validation. The description does not provide enough detail to select a more specific variant of CWE-20.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-657: Violation of Secure Design Principles\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product violates well-established principles for secure design.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
