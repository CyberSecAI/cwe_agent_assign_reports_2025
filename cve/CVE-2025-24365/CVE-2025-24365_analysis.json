  "description": "vaultwarden is an unofficial Bitwarden compatible server written in Rust, formerly known as bitwarden_rs. Attacker can obtain owner rights of other organization. Hacker should know the ID of victim organization (in real case the user can be a part of the organization as an unprivileged user) and be the owner/admin of other organization (by default you can create your own organization) in order to attack. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.33.0.",

  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-24365 based on provided content:\n\n**CVE Description:** PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval (as per instructions)\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from variable confusion in the `OrgHeaders` trait within `src/auth.rs`. Specifically, the server retrieves the organization UUID from either the path parameter or a GET query parameter. If both are present, the GET query parameter overwrites the path parameter.  This allows an attacker to manipulate the organization ID used in subsequent operations.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **CWE-284:** Improper List of Files to Include (This is the CWE listed in the advisory)\n*   Variable confusion/parameter manipulation.\n*   Insecure direct object reference (IDOR) - an attacker can access resources of another organization by manipulating the organization ID.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   **Privilege escalation:** An attacker can gain owner rights in a foreign organization.\n*   **Data breach:** Potential access to sensitive data within the compromised organization.\n*   **Unauthorized access:** Ability to invite users and modify settings within the target organization.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.\n*   **DELETE request:** Deleting a foreign organization using a manipulated `organizationId` query parameter.\n*   **POST request:** Inviting users to a foreign organization or confirming user enrollment using a manipulated `organizationId` query parameter.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   The attacker needs to know the UUID of the target organization.\n*   The attacker needs to be an owner or admin of another organization.\n*   Low privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability. No user interaction is needed.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   The vulnerability is patched in version 1.33.0.\n*   The remediation developer is identified as BlackDex.\n*   The advisory recommends updating to the patched version as soon as possible.\n\n**Additional Details (more detail than official CVE description):**\n\nThe content provides a detailed explanation of the vulnerability, including the specific code location (`src/auth.rs`), a PoC demonstrating how to exploit the vulnerability, and a CVSS score (High - 8.1). It also lists the contributors who reported and fixed the issue. The advisory also details the specific endpoints that are vulnerable.",

CWE-284 is a Class level CWE and is a parent of CWE-639. The analysis favors CWE-639 because it is more specific and maps directly to the **root cause** of the vulnerability, which is the **authorization bypass** due to the manipulation of the organization ID. CWE-284 is a broader category and less descriptive of the specific vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n\n    cwe639 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe639 primary\n    class cwe284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper handling of the organization ID**, which allows an attacker to **bypass authorization** checks and gain unauthorized access to resources belonging to another organization.\n\nRoot Cause: **CWE-639 Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key** - The server uses an externally controlled organization ID to authorize access, allowing an attacker to manipulate this ID and bypass authorization checks.\nImpact: Privilege Escalation - The attacker gains owner rights in a foreign organization, leading to potential data breach and unauthorized access.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis identifies CWE-639 as the primary CWE because it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability: the **authorization bypass** due to user-controlled key. The vulnerability description and CVE Reference Links Content Summary clearly indicate that the attacker can manipulate the organization ID to gain unauthorized access to other organization's resources.\n\nEvidence:\n\"The vulnerability stems from variable confusion in the `OrgHeaders` trait within `src/auth.rs`.
