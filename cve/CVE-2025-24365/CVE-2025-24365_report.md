# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2025-24365

## Description

vaultwarden is an unofficial Bitwarden compatible server written in Rust, formerly known as bitwarden_rs. Attacker can obtain owner rights of other organization. Hacker should know the ID of victim organization (in real case the user can be a part of the organization as an unprivileged user) and be the owner/admin of other organization (by default you can create your own organization) in order to attack. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.33.0.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-639, which is a Base level CWE and a child of CWE-284. CWE-284 is a Class level CWE and is a parent of CWE-639. The analysis favors CWE-639 because it is more specific and maps directly to the **root cause** of the vulnerability, which is the **authorization bypass** due to the manipulation of the organization ID. CWE-284 is a broader category and less descriptive of the specific vulnerability.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **improper handling of the organization ID**, which allows an attacker to **bypass authorization** checks and gain unauthorized access to resources belonging to another organization.

Root Cause: **CWE-639 Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key** - The server uses an externally controlled organization ID to authorize access, allowing an attacker to manipulate this ID and bypass authorization checks.
Impact: Privilege Escalation - The attacker gains owner rights in a foreign organization, leading to potential data breach and unauthorized access.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis identifies CWE-639 as the primary CWE because it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability: the **authorization bypass** due to user-controlled key. The vulnerability description and CVE Reference Links Content Summary clearly indicate that the attacker can manipulate the organization ID to gain unauthorized access to other organization's resources.

Evidence:
"The vulnerability stems from variable confusion in the `OrgHeaders` trait within `src/auth.rs`. Specifically, the server retrieves the organization UUID from either the path parameter or a GET query parameter. If both are present, the GET query parameter overwrites the path parameter. This allows an attacker to manipulate the organization ID used in subsequent operations."

CWE-284 was also considered, as it is listed in the advisory, but it's a more general Improper Access Control issue, and CWE-639 provides a more precise description of the **root cause**.

The retriever results also suggest CWE-639 as a strong candidate, further reinforcing the decision.

Other CWEs Considered but Not Used:

*   CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization - While related, it is more general than CWE-639.
*   CWE-610: Externally Controlled Reference to a Resource in Another Sphere - While the organization ID is externally controlled, the core issue is the authorization bypass, making CWE-639 more appropriate.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-610: Externally Controlled Reference to a Resource in Another Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses an externally controlled name or reference that resolves to a resource that is outside of the intended control sphere.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70

The product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.69

The product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 1054.58
**Source**: sparse
