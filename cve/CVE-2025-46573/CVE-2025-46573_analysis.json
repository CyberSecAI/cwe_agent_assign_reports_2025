A vulnerability present starting in version 3.0.5 up to and including version 4.6.3 allows an attacker to impersonate any user during SAML authentication by tampering with a valid SAML response. This can be done by adding attributes to the response. Users are affected specifically when the service provider is using `passport-wsfed-saml2` and a valid SAML Response signed by the Identity Provider can be obtained. Version 4.6.4 contains a fix for the vulnerability.",

CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) is a parent of CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function). While the vulnerability doesn't involve missing authentication, the end result is that the application fails to properly authenticate users, making CWE-287 relevant, but less specific than CWE-347.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe347[\"CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature\"]\n    cwe345[\"CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n\n    cwe347 -->|CHILDOF| cwe345\n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n\n    class cwe347 primary\n    class cwe287 secondary\n    class cwe345,cwe306 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper verification of the cryptographic signature** (CWE-347). This allows an attacker to tamper with a valid SAML response. By adding attributes to the response, the attacker can **impersonate any user** during SAML authentication. The vulnerability leads to **improper authentication** (CWE-287) as the application trusts a tampered SAML response.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe primary weakness is the **improper verification of the cryptographic signature** in the SAML response (CWE-347). The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" clearly states that the root cause allows an attacker to **impersonate any user during SAML authentication by tampering with a valid SAML response**. The ability to tamper with the SAML response, due to the **improper signature verification**, is the core issue.\n\nCWE-287 is a possible, but less specific, classification. The ultimate impact is an authentication bypass, but the root cause lies in the signature verification. The provided guidance highlights that if the root cause is known it is best to choose that CWE.\n\nThe confidence in CWE-347 is high because the description explicitly mentions tampering with a valid SAML response and the root cause of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this

at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**NOT USED:** While related to authentication, the issue isn't with the implementation of the authentication algorithm itself but rather the verification of the SAML response's signature.\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web

level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**NOT USED:** While the SAML response is being tampered with, this CWE is more related to web parameters, and SAML is

Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n**NOT USED:** This is too high-level, CWE-287 is a better choice here.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**NOT USED:** While the application relies on the SAML

resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
