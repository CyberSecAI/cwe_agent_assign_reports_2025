# Analysis Report for CVE-2024-5899

# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-5899

## Description

When Bazel Plugin in intellij imports a project (either using import project or Auto import) the dialog for trusting the project is not displayed. This comes from the fact that both call the method ProjectBuilder.createProject which then calls ProjectManager.getInstance().createProject. This method, as its name suggests is intended to create a new project, not to import an existing one. We recommend upgrading to version 2024.06.04.0.2 or beyond for the IntelliJ, CLion and Android Studio Bazel plugins.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Rootcause:** improper use of ProjectBuilder.createProject
- **Impact:** trusting of project without user consent
- **Product:** Bazel Plugin in intellij
- **Version:** before 2024.06.04.0.2

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-862 | Missing Authorization | 0.8 | Class | Primary | Allowed-with-Review |
| CWE-451 | User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information | 0.6 | Class | Secondary | Allowed-with-Review |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that influenced the decision was that CWE-862 is a Class-level CWE which has more specific Base-level children. However, none of those children seemed to fit the specific vulnerability as well as CWE-862 itself. CWE-451 was considered because the trust dialog not being shown is a misrepresentation of critical information.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **improper use of ProjectBuilder.createProject**, leading to the **missing trust confirmation dialog**, ultimately resulting in the trusting of a project without user consent.

## Summary of Analysis
The primary focus was on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary both indicate that the **missing trust confirmation dialog** is the core issue. This aligns well with CWE-862, Missing Authorization, as the dialog is meant to authorize the project for execution. While CWE-451, User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information, is also relevant, it is a secondary aspect of the vulnerability, as the primary issue is the absence of the authorization step.

The evidence for CWE-862 is: "This comes from the fact that both call the method ProjectBuilder.createProject which then calls ProjectManager.getInstance().createProject. This method, as its name suggests is intended to create a new project, not to import an existing one." and "The primary vulnerability is the **missing trust confirmation dialog**. This bypasses a key security feature of IntelliJ, which is designed to protect users from opening potentially untrusted or malicious projects."

The evidence for CWE-451 is: the **missing trust confirmation dialog** itself misrepresents the state of the project as trusted when it has not been explicitly authorized by the user.

The selection of CWE-862 as the primary CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the core issue of the **missing authorization** check.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-451: User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The user interface (UI) does not properly represent critical information to the user, allowing the information - or its source - to be obscured or spoofed. This is often a component in phishing attacks.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-862: Missing Authorization
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.407

**Description**: The product does not perform an authorization check when it is required.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
