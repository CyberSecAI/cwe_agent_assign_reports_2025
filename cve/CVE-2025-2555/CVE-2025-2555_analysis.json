  "description": "A vulnerability classified as problematic has been found in Audi Universal Traffic Recorder App 2.0. Affected is an unknown function of the component FTP Credentials. The manipulation leads to **use of hard-coded password**. Attacking locally is a requirement. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitability is told to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. Upgrading to version 2.89 and 2.90 is able to address this issue. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component. The vendor was contacted early about these issues and acted very professional. Version 2.89 is fixing this issue for new customers and 2.90 is going to fix it for existing customers.",

The selection of CWE-259 is based on the specific description of the vulnerability involving a hard-coded password. The hierarchical relationship influenced the decision to choose the most specific CWE available.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe259[\"CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password\"]\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    cwe1391[\"CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\"]\n\n    cwe259 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n    cwe798 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1391\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe259 primary\n    class cwe798,cwe1391 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **use of a hard-coded password** (CWE-259), which allows unauthorized access or manipulation of the system. The root cause is the hard-coded password itself.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is primarily based on the provided vulnerability description, which explicitly mentions \"**use of hard-coded password**.\" This aligns perfectly with CWE-259 (Use of Hard-coded Password). The relationship graph shows how CWE-259 is a specific type of CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials) and CWE-1391 (Use of Weak Credentials), making it the most appropriate choice.\n\nCWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')) and CWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')) were considered but discarded because the vulnerability description does not indicate any issues related to input validation or SQL commands.\n\nThe final selection of CWE-259 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the vulnerability described in the report. The high confidence score is due to the clear and explicit mention of \"hard-coded password\" in the vulnerability description.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
