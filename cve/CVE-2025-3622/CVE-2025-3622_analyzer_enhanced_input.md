## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-3622 Content

The provided content details a vulnerability report concerning the `xorbitsai/inference` project on GitHub. It is **RELATED** to a potential security issue. Here's a breakdown of the information extracted:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from using `torch.load` without the `weights_only=True` parameter when deserializing model state dictionaries from potentially untrusted files (`llm_model`, `flow_model`, `hift_model`). This allows for arbitrary code execution if the files contain malicious pickle data.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data:** Specifically, the unsafe use of `torch.load` without proper safeguards.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The code doesn't validate or sanitize the file paths used for loading models, making it easier for an attacker to supply malicious files.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Potential for gaining unauthorized access to the system.
*   **Data Leakage:** Risk of sensitive data being leaked.
*   **System Compromise:** Complete compromise of the system is possible.

**Attack vectors:**

*   An attacker can create malicious pickle files disguised as model state dictionaries.
*   The attacker can then manipulate the system to load these malicious files using the vulnerable `load` method. This could involve replacing legitimate model files with the malicious ones.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to provide or influence the file paths used by the `load` method. This could involve file system access or the ability to control environment variables.
*   The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious pickle files containing executable code.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   Add the `weights_only=True` parameter to all `torch.load` calls within the `load` method.  Example:
    ```
    self.llm.load_state_dict(torch.load(llm_model, map_location=self.device, weights_only=True), strict=True)
    ```

**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**

*   The vulnerability is located in `xinference/thirdparty/cosyvoice/cli/model.py` at lines L61C1-L72C1.
*   The report includes a detailed reproduction process, outlining how to create malicious files and exploit the vulnerability.
*   The issue is labeled as "stale" on GitHub, suggesting it may not be actively addressed.
*   The issue is associated with milestone `v1.x`.
*   The report provides information about the system environment (Docker, pip install, source installation) but states the vulnerability isn't version-specific.
