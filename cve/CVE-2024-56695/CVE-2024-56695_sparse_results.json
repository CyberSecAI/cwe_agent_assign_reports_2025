  "query": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drm/amdkfd Use dynamic allocation for CU occupancy array in kfd_get_cu_occupancy() The `kfd_get_cu_occupancy` function previously declared a large `cu_occupancy` array as a local variable, which could lead to stack overflows due to excessive stack usage. This commit replaces the static array allocation with dynamic memory allocation using `kcalloc`, thereby reducing the stack size. This change avoids the risk of stack overflows in kernel space, in scenarios where `AMDGPU_MAX_QUEUES` is large. The allocated memory is freed using `kfree` before the function returns to prevent memory leaks. Fixes the below with gcc W=1 drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../amdkfd/kfd_process.c In function kfd_get_cu_occupancy drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../amdkfd/kfd_process.c3221 warning the frame size of 1056 bytes is larger than 1024 bytes [-Wframe-larger-than=] 322 | } | ^",
