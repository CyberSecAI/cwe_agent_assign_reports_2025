  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drm/amdkfd Use dynamic allocation for CU occupancy array in kfd_get_cu_occupancy() The `kfd_get_cu_occupancy` function previously declared a large `cu_occupancy` array as a local variable, which could lead to stack overflows due to excessive stack usage. This commit replaces the static array allocation with dynamic memory allocation using `kcalloc`, thereby reducing the stack size. This change avoids the risk of stack overflows in kernel space, in scenarios where `AMDGPU_MAX_QUEUES` is large. The allocated memory is freed using `kfree` before the function returns to prevent memory leaks. Fixes the below with gcc W=1 drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../amdkfd/kfd_process.c In function kfd_get_cu_occupancy drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../amdkfd/kfd_process.c3221 warning the frame size of 1056 bytes is larger than 1024 bytes [-Wframe-larger-than=] 322 | } | ^",

  "reference_content": "The provided content relates to a fix for a potential stack overflow vulnerability in the Linux kernel, specifically within the `kfd_get_cu_occupancy` function. This aligns with the provided CVE description of a PLACEHOLDER.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe `kfd_get_cu_occupancy` function previously declared a large `cu_occupancy` array as a local variable on the stack. When `AMDGPU_MAX_QUEUES` was large, this could lead to excessive stack usage, potentially causing a stack overflow.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- Stack overflow due to large stack allocation.\n- Potential for denial-of-service or unexpected behavior.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- A stack overflow in kernel space can lead to crashes or other unexpected behavior which can lead to denial of service\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- Triggering the `kfd_get_cu_occupancy` function with a large `AMDGPU_MAX_QUEUES` value.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- The attacker would need to interact with the AMD KFD driver and influence the `AMDGPU_MAX_QUEUES` setting which would require a local user with proper privileges to trigger the vulnerable code path.\n\n**Fix:**\nThe fix replaces the static array allocation with dynamic memory allocation using `kcalloc`. This allocates the memory from the heap instead of the stack, avoiding the stack overflow. The allocated memory is then freed with `kfree` before the function returns. This also includes an error check to return `-ENOMEM` if memory allocation fails.",

CWE-770 is a base CWE that describes allocating resources without limits or throttling. CWE-789 specifically focuses on memory allocation with an excessive size value. The vulnerability description clearly states that a large array was allocated on the stack, which could lead to stack overflows. This aligns well with CWE-789. CWE-1325, Improperly Controlled Sequential Memory Allocation, is also related as it describes managing a group of objects and performing a separate memory allocation for each object without properly limiting the total amount of memory consumed.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe789[\"CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe1325[\"CWE-1325: Improperly Controlled Sequential Memory Allocation\"]\n\n    cwe789 -->|CHILDOF| cwe770\n    cwe1325 -->|CHILDOF| cwe770\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe789 primary\n    class cwe770,cwe1325 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper memory allocation** (CWE-789), leading to **excessive stack usage**, and finally resulting in a **potential stack overflow**.\n  - The root cause is the allocation of an excessive size value for memory.\n  - The impact is a potential stack overflow, which could lead to denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-789 Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value. This is supported by the vulnerability description, which states that the `kfd_get_cu_occupancy` function declared a large `cu_occupancy` array as a local variable, which could lead to stack overflows due to excessive stack usage. The fix involves replacing the static array allocation with dynamic memory allocation, further supporting this classification.\n\nCWE-770 and CWE-1325 are also considered because the vulnerability involves allocating resources (memory) without proper limits. However, CWE-789 is more specific because it directly addresses the excessive size value used in the memory allocation, which leads to the stack overflow. Therefore, CWE-789 is chosen as the primary CWE.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-789 is a Variant, which is a preferred level of abstraction. CWE-770 and CWE-1325 are Base level CWEs, which is also a preferred level of abstraction.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs a calculation that can\n         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic\n         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than\n         the original value.
