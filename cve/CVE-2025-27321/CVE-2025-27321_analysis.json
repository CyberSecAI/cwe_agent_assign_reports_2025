The secondary weakness is **CWE-79** Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting'), because the CSRF **rootcause** leads to stored XSS which is an impact of the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n\n    cwe79 -- CANFOLLOW --> cwe352\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe352 primary\n    class cwe79 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **CWE-352** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) as the **rootcause**. Due to the CSRF vulnerability, an attacker can force a user to perform actions they did not intend. In this case, this leads to **CWE-79** Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') in the form of stored XSS.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe vulnerability description clearly states a **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** vulnerability leads to stored XSS in Blighty Explorer. The **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases** section also highlights \"**Cross-Site Request Forgery**\" as the **rootcause** and \"**stored XSS**\" as a **weakness**. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms that the **root cause** of the vulnerability is **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**.\n\nThe Retriever Results list **CWE-79** Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') and **CWE-352** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) as the top candidates. Based on the evidence, **CWE-352** is selected as the primary weakness because it's the **rootcause**, and **CWE-79** is selected as a secondary weakness because the CSRF vulnerability leads to stored XSS.
