  "reference_content": "CVE-2024-54803\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability is a command injection in the router\u2019s PPPoE configuration, specifically within the `sysinit` binary. It occurs because the `pppoe_peer_mac` NVRAM parameter is processed without proper sanitization. The `sprintf` function incorporates this value into a system call without validating its content.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- Command Injection\n- Insufficient Input Validation\n- Improper Sanitization\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\nSuccessful exploitation allows authenticated attackers to execute arbitrary system commands with root privileges. The injected commands persist across device reboots as they are stored in NVRAM, providing permanent access until manually remediated. This can lead to complete compromise of the router.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- Attacker must be authenticated to the router\u2019s administrative interface.\n- Modify the PPPoE peer MAC setting via the web administration interface.\n- Send a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the router\u2019s `/post.cgi` endpoint.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- Authentication to the router\u2019s administrative interface.\n- Knowledge of the vulnerable parameter (`pppoe_peer_mac`).\n- Ability to craft a malicious payload containing shell metacharacters.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\nThe content does not specify a fix, but implies that proper input validation and sanitization of the `pppoe_peer_mac` parameter are necessary to prevent the vulnerability.\n\n**Additional Details:**\nThe content provides more detail than the official CVE description, detailing the specific function (`sysinit`) and address (`0x0000d0f4`) where the vulnerability occurs, as well as the specific `sprintf` call involved. It also provides a sample exploit payload. The vulnerability is boot persistent due to storage in NVRAM.",

It falls under the class CWE-77 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command) and CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')). CWE-1287 (Improper Validation of Specified Type of Input) is a related weakness that can precede CWE-78 by allowing the unsanitized input to reach the command execution.\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    cwe1287[\"CWE-1287: Improper Validation of Specified Type of Input\"]\n\n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe1287 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe78\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe77,cwe74,cwe1287 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **Improper Validation of Input (CWE-1287)**, leading to **Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command (CWE-78)**, which results in arbitrary command execution with root privileges. The injected commands are stored in NVRAM, making the compromise persistent.\n  - Improper Validation of Input (CWE-1287) -> Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command (CWE-78) -> Arbitrary command execution with root privileges.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and CVE reference content summary. The key evidence is the **command injection** vulnerability in Netgear WNR854T, specifically in the `pppoe_peer_mac` parameter, which is processed without proper sanitization using the `sprintf` function. This aligns directly with CWE-78, which describes **improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS command**. The retriever results also strongly suggest CWE-78 and its class CWE-77 as primary candidates.\n\nCWE-1287 is included as a secondary weakness because the root cause includes **insufficient input validation**.\n\nThe relationship graph shows the hierarchical relationship between CWE-78 and its parent classes, as well as the potential for CWE-1287 to precede CWE-78. The final selection of CWE-78 is at the optimal level of specificity as it accurately represents the type of injection occurring (OS command injection) and is a base-level CWE as recommended by MITRE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended command when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: CWE-77 is often misused when OS command injection (CWE-78) was intended instead [REF-1287].\n\n*NOT USED:* While CWE-77 is a parent class of CWE-78, the vulnerability description clearly indicates OS command injection, making the more specific CWE-78 a better fit.\n\n## CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*USED:* The vulnerability description clearly indicates that the vulnerability is an OS command injection, and this CWE perfectly describes this vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-790: Improper Filtering of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives data from an upstream component, but does not filter or incorrectly filters special elements before sending it to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*NOT USED:* This is a more general CWE and CWE-78 is a better fit.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n*NOT USED:* This is a more general CWE and CWE-78 is a better fit.\n\n## CWE-134: Use of Externally-Controlled Format String\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a function that accepts a format string as an argument, but the format string originates from an external source.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*NOT USED:* The vulnerability summary mentions the `sprintf` function, but it is being used to construct a system call, not as a format string vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
