This content **IS RELATED** to a vulnerability and provides more detail than a standard CVE description. It details a SQL injection vulnerability in the "Restaurant Management System Project V1.0".

Here's a breakdown of the extracted information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   Insufficient user input validation of the 'id' parameter in the `/admin/assign_save.php` file.  Malicious code injected into this parameter is directly used in SQL queries without proper cleaning or validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   SQL Injection

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Unauthorized database access
*   Sensitive data leakage
*   Data tampering
*   Comprehensive system control
*   Service interruption

**Attack vectors:**

*   The `/admin/assign_save.php` file is vulnerable.
*   No login or authorization is required to exploit the vulnerability.
*   The 'id' parameter is the entry point for the attack.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to send a crafted POST request to `/admin/assign_save.php` with a malicious payload in the 'id' parameter. No authentication is required.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   Use prepared statements and parameter binding.
*   Input validation and filtering.
*   Minimize database user permissions.
*   Regular security audits.

**Payload Examples (provided in the content):**

The content includes several payloads for different types of SQL injection attacks (boolean-based blind, error-based, time-based blind) using `sqlmap`.
