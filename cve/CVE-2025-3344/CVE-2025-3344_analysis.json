  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-3344 Content\n\nThis content **IS RELATED** to a vulnerability and provides more detail than a standard CVE description. It details a SQL injection vulnerability in the \"Restaurant Management System Project V1.0\".\n\nHere's a breakdown of the extracted information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\n*   Insufficient user input validation of the 'id' parameter in the `/admin/assign_save.php` file.  Malicious code injected into this parameter is directly used in SQL queries without proper cleaning or validation.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   SQL Injection\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   Unauthorized database access\n*   Sensitive data leakage\n*   Data tampering\n*   Comprehensive system control\n*   Service interruption\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   The `/admin/assign_save.php` file is vulnerable.\n*   No login or authorization is required to exploit the vulnerability.\n*   The 'id' parameter is the entry point for the attack.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   An attacker needs to be able to send a crafted POST request to `/admin/assign_save.php` with a malicious payload in the 'id' parameter. No authentication is required.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   Use prepared statements and parameter binding.\n*   Input validation and filtering.\n*   Minimize database user permissions.\n*   Regular security audits.\n\n**Payload Examples (provided in the content):**\n\nThe content includes several payloads for different types of SQL injection attacks (boolean-based blind, error-based, time-based blind) using `sqlmap`.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n*   **Affected Product:** Restaurant Management System Project in PHP with Source Code\n*   **Vendor Homepage:** <https://itsourcecode.com/free-projects/php-project/online-restaurant-management-system-project-in-php-with-source-code/>\n*   **Vulnerable File:** `/admin/assign_save.php`\n*   **Version:** V1.0\n*   **Software Link:** <https://itsourcecode.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/altonsystem.zip>\n*   **Submitter:** pyj2cve",
