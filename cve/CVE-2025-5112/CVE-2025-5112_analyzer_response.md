# Raw Analyzer Response for CVE-2025-5112

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-120 | Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow') | 1.0 | Base | Primary | Allowed-with-Review |
| CWE-119 | Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer | 0.7 | Class | Secondary | Discouraged |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship influencing the CWE selection is the parent-child relationship between CWE-119 and CWE-120. CWE-120 is a more specific instance of the general **improper restriction of operations within memory bounds**, capturing the precise mechanism of **buffer copy without checking size**, leading to a **buffer overflow**. CWE-120 can also precede CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write), indicating a potential vulnerability chain. The choice of CWE-120 (Base) over CWE-119 (Class) reflects a preference for a lower, more specific abstraction level.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of input validation** for the `MGET` command in FreeFloat FTP Server 1.0. This **allows an attacker to send a payload larger than the allocated buffer**. The **buffer overflow** (CWE-120) then leads to the attacker overwriting the execution flow, potentially achieving arbitrary code execution.

## Summary of Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-120 (**Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')**). This is based on the vulnerability description indicating a **buffer overflow** due to the component MGET Command Handler, and the analysis of CVE-2025-5112 content, which explicitly states that the server **does not properly validate the size of the input** provided with the `MGET` command, leading to a **buffer overflow**. The exploit achieves shell access by overwriting the EIP.

CWE-119 (**Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer**) was considered as a more general classification, but CWE-120 provides a more precise description of the root cause, which is the buffer copy operation without proper size checking. While the **Retriever Results** lists CWE-119 first, CWE-120 is still a better match.

The evidence supports the selection of CWE-120 at the Base level of abstraction, as it directly reflects the **root cause of the vulnerability**. The guidance for CWE-120 suggests review before use, indicating it can be misused. However, in this case, the root cause explicitly involves a buffer copy operation without checking the input size, aligning perfectly with the CWE description.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-193: Off-by-one Error
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A product calculates or uses an incorrect maximum or minimum value that is 1 more, or 1 less, than the correct value.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-134: Use of Externally-Controlled Format String
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a function that accepts a format string as an argument, but the format string originates from an external source.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value
**Abstraction Level**: Variant

## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 1179.91
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product performs a calculation that can
         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic
         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than
         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is
         incremented to a value that is too large to store in the
         associated representation. When this occurs, the value may
         become a very small or negative number.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is
