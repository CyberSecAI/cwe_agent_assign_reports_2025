This vulnerability can be exploited by appending characters, such as dashes (-), to the end of a multipart boundary in an HTTP request.

While it is a Class-level CWE and thus less specific, the description of the vulnerability directly involves excessive resource consumption due to continuous processing. CWE-1284 was considered as a secondary factor because the multipart boundary could be viewed as a \"specified quantity\" that is not properly validated. However, the primary issue is the consumption of resources, making CWE-400 the more relevant choice.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe1284[\"CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\"]\n\n    cwe1284 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe400 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe410[\"CWE-410: Insufficient Resource Pool\"]\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe400 primary\n    class cwe1284 secondary\n    class cwe20,cwe410 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **weakness** of the server not properly handling characters appended to the multipart boundary, leading to continuous processing, and culminating in a Denial of Service (DoS) due to excessive resource consumption.\n  - **Root Cause:** Improper handling of characters appended to multipart boundary\n  - **Weakness:** Continuous processing of each character\n  - **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) and resource consumption.\n  - **Primary CWE:** CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis indicates a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability in berriai/litellm v1.44.5, triggered by appending characters to the multipart boundary in an HTTP request. The server's continuous processing of these characters results in excessive resource consumption, leading to service unavailability.\n\nThe primary CWE selected is CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption. This is based on the direct impact of the vulnerability, which is the exhaustion of resources. The vulnerability description key phrases highlight \"denial of service\" and \"resource consumption,\" directly aligning with CWE-400. The retriever results also list CWE-400 as a potential candidate, although with a \"Discouraged\" usage recommendation. However, the direct nature of the resource consumption makes it a relevant choice, despite being a Class-level CWE.\n\nCWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input was considered because the appended characters to the multipart boundary can be seen as a failure to properly validate the input quantity. However, the primary consequence is resource exhaustion, making CWE-400 more appropriate.\n\nThe assessment is based on the provided evidence, specifically the vulnerability description key phrases that explicitly mention \"denial of service\" and \"resource consumption.\"\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-130: Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.67\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product parses a formatted message or structure, but it does not handle or incorrectly handles a length field that is inconsistent with the actual length of the associated data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-617: Reachable Assertion\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.67\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains an assert() or similar statement that can be triggered by an attacker, which leads to an application exit or other behavior that is more severe than necessary.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.67\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1286: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.66\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input that is expected to be well-formed - i.e., to comply with a certain syntax - but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input complies with the syntax.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.66\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.66\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource, thereby enabling an actor to influence the amount of resources consumed, eventually leading to the exhaustion of available resources.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-400 is intended for incorrect behaviors in which the product is expected to track and restrict how many resources it consumes, but CWE-400 is often misused because it is conflated with the \"technical impact\" of vulnerabilities in which resource consumption occurs.
