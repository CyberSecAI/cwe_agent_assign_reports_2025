CWE-280 directly addresses the **improper handling of insufficient permissions**, while CWE-284 is a broader categorization of **improper access control**.

This maps directly to CWE-280, which is at the Base level of abstraction and is ALLOWED for mapping. The evidence from the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" explicitly states: \"**rootcause:** **Improper handling of insufficient permission**.\" The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also confirms this, stating: \"Improper handling of insufficient permission in SpenGesture service.\" The retriever results also list CWE-280 at the top.\n\nCWE-284 (Improper Access Control) was considered but deemed less specific. While the vulnerability could be seen as a form of improper access control, the root cause lies specifically in the handling of permissions, making CWE-280 a more accurate and descriptive classification. The MITRE guidance also says that CWE-284 is often overused and to use a more specific CWE if possible.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions. This may cause it to follow unexpected code paths that may leave the product in an invalid state.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-284: Improper Access Control\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 1261.31\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-284 is extremely high-level, a Pillar.

Hardware mechanisms may be used to protect against alteration of the threshold limit values by untrusted software.\n\n\nThe limit values are generally programmed in standard units for the type of value being read. However, the hardware-sensor blocks may report the settings in different units depending upon sensor design and operation. The raw sensor output value is converted to the desired units using a scale conversion based on the parametric data programmed into the sensor. The final converted value is then compared with the previously programmed limits.\n\n\nWhile the limit values are usually protected, the sensor parametric data values may not be. By changing the parametric data, safe operational limits may be bypassed.\n",
