# Retrieval Query for CVE-2024-10327

## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability in Okta Verify for iOS versions 9.25.1 (beta) and 9.27.0 (including beta) allows push notification responses through the iOS ContextExtension feature allowing the authentication to proceed regardless of the users selection. When a user long-presses the notification banner and selects an option, both options allow the authentication to succeed. The ContextExtension feature is one of several push mechanisms available when using Okta Verify Push on iOS devices. The vulnerable flows include * When a user is presented with a notification on a locked screen, the user presses on the notification directly and selects their reply without unlocking the device * When a user is presented with a notification on the home screen and drags the notification down and selects their reply * When an Apple Watch is used to reply directly to a notification. A pre-condition for this vulnerability is that the user must have enrolled in Okta Verify while the Okta customer was using Okta Classic. This applies irrespective of whether the organization has since upgraded to Okta Identity Engine.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **authentication bypass**
- **vector:** push notification responses and long-press notification banner and select an option
- **product:** Okta Verify for iOS
- **version:** 9.25.1 (beta) and 9.27.0 (including beta)

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-10327:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how Okta Verify for iOS handles push notification responses through the iOS ContextExtension feature. Specifically, when a user interacts with a push notification via long-press or dragging (without unlocking the device), the authentication process proceeds regardless of whether the user selects "Approve" or "Deny." This effectively bypasses the intended user decision.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Authentication:** The core issue is the failure to properly validate the user's response to the push notification when using the ContextExtension. The application does not correctly interpret the user's selection from the notification options.
*   **Bypass of MFA:** By ignoring the user's choice, an attacker can potentially bypass the MFA process, gaining unauthorized access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to a user's account.
*   **Compromise of Accounts:** With the ability to bypass MFA, an attacker can potentially compromise user accounts, leading to data breaches, identity theft, and other malicious activities.
*  **Circumvention of Security Controls:** The vulnerability circumvents the security measures put in place by Okta's multi-factor authentication.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Push Notification Manipulation:** The attacker triggers a push notification to the targeted user's iOS device.
*   **ContextExtension Abuse:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability in how Okta Verify handles the response from the iOS ContextExtension feature of the push notification.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Initiate MFA challenge:** The attacker needs to trigger an authentication attempt that requires Okta Verify push notification. This implies knowledge of the user's credentials or a method to initiate an authentication flow (such as a stolen session token)
*   **No device access needed:** The attacker does not need access to the victim's device itself. The attack leverages the push notification mechanism and its associated context extension.
*  **User interaction (limited):** The user must receive a push notification and interact with it by long-pressing or dragging it down to see the available options, but the user's actual choice is ignored.

**Additional Notes:**

*   **Precondition:** The vulnerability affects users who enrolled in Okta Verify while the Okta customer was using Okta Classic.
*   **Affected Versions:**  Specifically, Okta Verify for iOS versions 9.25.1 (beta) and 9.27.0 (including beta and the released version) were affected.
*   **Resolution:** The vulnerability has been fixed in version 9.27.2 and later. Affected users were prevented from authenticating from vulnerable versions, indicating a server-side block.
*   **CVSS Score:**  The provided CVSS v3 score is 8.1, categorized as high severity.

- **CVE-2017-5697:** Hardware/firmware product has insufficient clickjacking protection in its web user interface
- **CVE-2017-4015:** Clickjacking in data-loss prevention product via HTTP response header.




## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or "zeroize" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.

### Extended Description


When resources are released, they can be made available for reuse. For example, after memory is de-allocated, an operating system may make the memory available to another process, or disk space may be reallocated when a file is deleted. As removing information requires time and additional resources, operating systems do not usually clear the previously written information.


Even when the resource is reused by the same process, this weakness can arise when new data is not as large as the old data, which leaves portions of the old data still available. Equivalent errors can occur in other situations where the length of data is variable but the associated data structure is not. If memory is not cleared after use, the information may be read by less trustworthy parties when the memory is reallocated.


This weakness can apply in hardware, such as when a device or system switches between power, sleep, or debug states during normal operation, or when execution changes to different users or privilege levels.


### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-459
ChildOf -> CWE-212
CanPrecede -> CWE-201

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** There is a close association between CWE-226 and CWE-212. The difference is partially that of perspective. CWE-226 is geared towards the final stage of the resource lifecycle, in which the resource is deleted, eliminated, expired, or otherwise released for reuse. Technically, this involves a transfer to a different control sphere, in which the original contents of the resource are no longer relevant. CWE-212, however, is intended for sensitive data in resources that are intentionally shared with others, so they are still active. This distinction is useful from the perspective of the CWE research view (CWE-1000).

**[Maintenance]** This entry needs modification to clarify the differences with CWE-212. The description also combines two problems that are distinct from the CWE research perspective: the inadvertent transfer of information to another sphere, and improper initialization/shutdown. Some of the associated taxonomy mappings reflect these different uses.

**[Research Gap]** This is frequently found for network packets, but it can also exist in local memory allocation, files, etc.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2019-3733:** Cryptography library does not clear heap memory before release
- **CVE-2003-0001:** Ethernet NIC drivers do not pad frames with null bytes, leading to infoleak from malformed packets.
- **CVE-2003-0291:** router does not clear information from DHCP packets that have been previously used




## CWE-862: Missing Authorization
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
AuthZ: "AuthZ" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authorization" within the web application security community. It is distinct from "AuthN" (or, sometimes, "AuthC") which is an abbreviation of "authentication." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.

### Relationships

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Additional Notes
**[Terminology]** Assuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-24730:** Go-based continuous deployment product does not check that a user has certain privileges to update or create an app, allowing adversaries to read sensitive repository information
- **CVE-2009-3168:** Web application does not restrict access to admin scripts, allowing authenticated users to reset administrative passwords.
- **CVE-2009-3597:** Web application stores database file under the web root with insufficient access control (CWE-219), allowing direct request.




## CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product processes an XML document that can contain XML entities with URIs that resolve to documents outside of the intended sphere of control, causing the product to embed incorrect documents into its output.

### Extended Description


XML documents optionally contain a Document Type Definition (DTD), which, among other features, enables the definition of XML entities. It is possible to define an entity by providing a substitution string in the form of a URI. The XML parser can access the contents of this URI and embed these contents back into the XML document for further processing.


By submitting an XML file that defines an external entity with a file:// URI, an attacker can cause the processing application to read the contents of a local file. For example, a URI such as "file:///c:/winnt/win.ini" designates (in Windows) the file C:\Winnt\win.ini, or file:///etc/passwd designates the password file in Unix-based systems. Using URIs with other schemes such as http://, the attacker can force the application to make outgoing requests to servers that the attacker cannot reach directly, which can be used to bypass firewall restrictions or hide the source of attacks such as port scanning.


Once the content of the URI is read, it is fed back into the application that is processing the XML. This application may echo back the data (e.g. in an error message), thereby exposing the file contents.


### Alternative Terms

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-610
ChildOf -> CWE-610
PeerOf -> CWE-441

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** CWE-918 (SSRF) and CWE-611 (XXE) are closely related, because they both involve web-related technologies and can launch outbound requests to unexpected destinations. However, XXE can be performed client-side, or in other contexts in which the software is not acting directly as a server, so the "Server" portion of the SSRF acronym does not necessarily apply.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-42745:** Recruiter software allows reading arbitrary files using XXE
- **CVE-2005-1306:** A browser control can allow remote attackers to determine the existence of files via Javascript containing XML script.
- **CVE-2012-5656:** XXE during SVG image conversion




## CWE-285: Improper Authorization
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.

### Extended Description


Assuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.


When access control checks are not applied consistently - or not at all - users are able to access data or perform actions that they should not be allowed to perform. This can lead to a wide range of problems, including information exposures, denial of service, and arbitrary code execution.


### Alternative Terms
AuthZ: "AuthZ" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authorization" within the web application security community. It is distinct from "AuthN" (or, sometimes, "AuthC") which is an abbreviation of "authentication." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.

### Relationships

ChildOf -> CWE-284

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-285 is high-level and lower-level CWEs can frequently be used instead. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
**Comments:** Look at CWE-285's children and consider mapping to CWEs such as CWE-862: Missing Authorization, CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization, CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource, or others.
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction
**Suggested Alternatives:**
- CWE-862: Missing Authorization
- CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization
- CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-24730:** Go-based continuous deployment product does not check that a user has certain privileges to update or create an app, allowing adversaries to read sensitive repository information
- **CVE-2009-3168:** Web application does not restrict access to admin scripts, allowing authenticated users to reset administrative passwords.
- **CVE-2009-2960:** Web application does not restrict access to admin scripts, allowing authenticated users to modify passwords of other users.
