  "cve_id": "CVE-2024-10327",
  "description": "A vulnerability in Okta Verify for iOS versions 9.25.1 (beta) and 9.27.0 (including beta) allows push notification responses through the iOS ContextExtension feature allowing the authentication to proceed regardless of the users selection. When a user long-presses the notification banner and selects an option, both options allow the authentication to succeed. The ContextExtension feature is one of several push mechanisms available when using Okta Verify Push on iOS devices. The vulnerable flows include * When a user is presented with a notification on a locked screen, the user presses on the notification directly and selects their reply without unlocking the device * When a user is presented with a notification on the home screen and drags the notification down and selects their reply * When an Apple Watch is used to reply directly to a notification. A pre-condition for this vulnerability is that the user must have enrolled in Okta Verify while the Okta customer was using Okta Classic. This applies irrespective of whether the organization has since upgraded to Okta Identity Engine.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-10327:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from how Okta Verify for iOS handles push notification responses through the iOS ContextExtension feature. Specifically, when a user interacts with a push notification via long-press or dragging (without unlocking the device), the authentication process proceeds regardless of whether the user selects \"Approve\" or \"Deny.\" This effectively bypasses the intended user decision.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Improper Authentication:** The core issue is the failure to properly validate the user's response to the push notification when using the ContextExtension. The application does not correctly interpret the user's selection from the notification options.\n*   **Bypass of MFA:** By ignoring the user's choice, an attacker can potentially bypass the MFA process, gaining unauthorized access.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Unauthorized Access:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to a user's account.\n*   **Compromise of Accounts:** With the ability to bypass MFA, an attacker can potentially compromise user accounts, leading to data breaches, identity theft, and other malicious activities.\n*  **Circumvention of Security Controls:** The vulnerability circumvents the security measures put in place by Okta's multi-factor authentication.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Push Notification Manipulation:** The attacker triggers a push notification to the targeted user's iOS device.\n*   **ContextExtension Abuse:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability in how Okta Verify handles the response from the iOS ContextExtension feature of the push notification.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Initiate MFA challenge:** The attacker needs to trigger an authentication attempt that requires Okta Verify push notification. This implies knowledge of the user's credentials or a method to initiate an authentication flow (such as a stolen session token)\n*   **No device access needed:** The attacker does not need access to the victim's device itself. The attack leverages the push notification mechanism and its associated context extension.\n*  **User interaction (limited):** The user must receive a push notification and interact with it by long-pressing or dragging it down to see the available options, but the user's actual choice is ignored.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n*   **Precondition:** The vulnerability affects users who enrolled in Okta Verify while the Okta customer was using Okta Classic.\n*   **Affected Versions:**  Specifically, Okta Verify for iOS versions 9.25.1 (beta) and 9.27.0 (including beta and the released version) were affected.\n*   **Resolution:** The vulnerability has been fixed in version 9.27.2 and later. Affected users were prevented from authenticating from vulnerable versions, indicating a server-side block.\n*   **CVSS Score:**  The provided CVSS v3 score is 8.1, categorized as high severity.\n\nThis information provides a good understanding of the vulnerability.",
