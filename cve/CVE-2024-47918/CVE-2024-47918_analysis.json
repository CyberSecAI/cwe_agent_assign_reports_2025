CWE-80 is a more specific variant focusing on the improper neutralization of script-related HTML tags. Given the description explicitly mentions \"Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags,\" both CWE-79 and CWE-80 are relevant. CWE-79 is the general case of **Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')**, while CWE-80 is a specific type of **Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags** that leads to XSS.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe80[\"CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\"]\n    \n    cwe80 -->|CHILDOF| cwe79\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe79 primary\n    class cwe80 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags**, which leads to the **XSS** vulnerability.\n- The Root Cause is the **Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags**\n- The weakness is the resulting **XSS** vulnerability.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states the **Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags** leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The phrase \"**Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags**\" from the vulnerability description key phrases provides strong evidence for CWE-79 and CWE-80.\n\nCWE-79 is selected as the primary because it's the fundamental weakness, and CWE-80 is a more specific variant. The evidence directly supports these classifications. The relationship (CWE-80 ChildOf CWE-79) guided the decision to include both, with CWE-79 as primary.\n\nThe retriever results support these choices, with CWE-79 having the highest score. The abstraction levels are appropriate, with CWE-79 as a Base and CWE-80 as a Variant.\n\nOther CWEs considered but not used:\n\n*   CWE-82, CWE-83, CWE-84: These are related to XSS but focus on specific contexts like IMG tags or URI schemes. Since the description doesn't specify these contexts, they are not selected.\n*   CWE-116: This relates to improper encoding/escaping of output, which is a broader category. The description is more specific about neutralization, so CWE-79 and CWE-80 are more appropriate.\n*   CWE-184: This involves an incomplete list of disallowed inputs. While this might be a contributing factor, the primary issue is the **improper neutralization**, making CWE-79 and CWE-80 more relevant.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-83: Improper Neutralization of Script in Attributes in a Web Page\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes \"javascript:\" or other URIs from dangerous attributes within tags, such as onmouseover, onload, onerror, or style.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-84: Improper Neutralization of Encoded URI Schemes in a Web Page\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application improperly neutralizes user-controlled input for executable script disguised with URI encodings.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-96: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Statically Saved Code ('Static Code Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes code syntax before inserting the input into an executable resource, such as a library, configuration file, or template.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-82: Improper Neutralization of Script in Attributes of IMG Tags in a Web Page\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes scripting elements within attributes of HTML IMG tags, such as the src attribute.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
