Navigate to the Settings - Contact Form tab.\n    2.  Go to Plugin Options and clear all fields.\n    3.  Enter a malicious payload (e.g., `onmouseover='alert(555)'`) in the Error Field Attributes field.\n    4.  Save the settings.\n    5.  Insert the shortcode `[simple_contact_form]` into a page.\n    6.  Trigger the error by clicking the check mark and the button to activate XSS.\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** High privilege users such as an admin.\n*   **Mitigation or fix:** Fixed in version 20250114.\n*   **Additional Detail:** Provides a proof of concept (PoC) and CVSS score.

  "analysis": "# Summary\n| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| CWE-79 | Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') | 1 | Base | Primary | Allowed |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. CWE-79, being a base-level CWE specifically addressing improper neutralization of input during web page generation, was selected as the primary CWE. The retriever results also highlighted CWE-79 as a strong candidate. The relationship analysis didn't reveal any parent-child relationships that would suggest a more specific CWE, and no chain relationships were applicable in this scenario.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe79 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **does not sanitise and escape some of its settings** (Improper Neutralization)\n2.  **Weakness:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting\n3.  **Impact:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks by high privilege users.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly pointed towards CWE-79 as the most appropriate classification, based on the vulnerability description and the retriever results. The description clearly states that the plugin **does not sanitise and escape some of its settings**, leading to Stored Cross-Site Scripting. This directly aligns with CWE-79's definition of improper neutralization of input during web page generation. The retriever results also support this classification, with CWE-79 being a top candidate.\n\nThe decision to select CWE-79 was also influenced by its base-level abstraction, which is preferred for root cause analysis. The mapping guidance for CWE-79 also supports its use in this scenario.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
