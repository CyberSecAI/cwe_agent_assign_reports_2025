  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved io_uring/rw fix **missing NOWAIT check** for O_DIRECT start write When io_uring starts a write, itll call kiocb_start_write() to bump the super block rwsem, preventing any freezes from happening while that write is in-flight. The freeze side will grab that rwsem for writing, excluding any new writers from happening and waiting for existing writes to finish. But io_uring unconditionally uses kiocb_start_write(), which will block if someone is currently attempting to freeze the mount point. This causes a **deadlock** where freeze is waiting for previous writes to complete, but the previous writes cannot complete, as the task that is supposed to complete them is blocked waiting on starting a new write. This results in the following stuck trace showing that dependency with the write blocked starting a new write taskfio stateD stack0 pid886 tgid886 ppid876 Call trace __switch_to+0x1d8/0x348 __schedule+0x8e8/0x2248 schedule+0x110/0x3f0 percpu_rwsem_wait+0x1e8/0x3f8 __percpu_down_read+0xe8/0x500 io_write+0xbb8/0xff8 io_issue_sqe+0x10c/0x1020 io_submit_sqes+0x614/0x2110 __arm64_sys_io_uring_enter+0x524/0x1038 invoke_syscall+0x74/0x268 el0_svc_common.constprop.0+0x160/0x238 do_el0_svc+0x44/0x60 el0_svc+0x44/0xb0 el0t_64_sync_handler+0x118/0x128 el0t_64_sync+0x168/0x170 INFO task fsfreeze7364 blocked for more than 15 seconds.

For normal issue where IOCB_NOWAIT would always be set, this returns -EAGAIN which will have io_uring core issue a blocking attempt of the write. That will in turn also get completions run, ensuring forward progress. Since freezing requires CAP_SYS_ADMIN in the first place, this isnt something that can be triggered by a regular user.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n\n- The `io_uring` subsystem in the Linux kernel was unconditionally calling `kiocb_start_write()` when initiating a write operation. This function attempts to acquire a superblock read/write semaphore (`rwsem`).\n- When a mount point is being frozen (e.g., via `fsfreeze`), the process doing the freezing will attempt to acquire this same semaphore, but for writing.\n- If the freeze operation attempts to acquire the semaphore while a write operation is in progress (or vice versa), a deadlock can occur. This is because the write operation might block waiting for the freezer to release the semaphore, while the freezer is waiting for the write operation to complete.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n- **Deadlock:** The primary vulnerability is a deadlock condition. The io_uring write operation and the mount point freeze operation can block each other indefinitely.\n- **Missing `IOCB_NOWAIT` Check:** The `io_uring` subsystem was not respecting the `IOCB_NOWAIT` flag, which can be set on io_uring requests. This flag indicates that the operation should not block if it cannot immediately acquire the necessary resources (in this case, the superblock semaphore). The io_uring code was unconditionally trying to acquire the semaphore, even if `IOCB_NOWAIT` was set.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The deadlock will cause the process initiating the `io_uring` write and the process freezing the filesystem to hang. This can lead to system instability and a denial of service.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n- **io_uring Write:** An attacker could trigger a vulnerable `io_uring` write operation, specifically an O_DIRECT write.\n- **Filesystem Freeze:** Concurrently, an attacker with CAP_SYS_ADMIN privileges could attempt to freeze the filesystem the write is targeting. This could be initiated using the `fsfreeze` utility or the `ioctl` system call that freezes filesystems..\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n- **CAP_SYS_ADMIN:** The filesystem freeze operation requires `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` privileges, meaning only a user with root privileges (or a process with this capability) can trigger that part of the vulnerability. \n- **Ability to initiate io_uring writes:** The attacker needs to be able to issue io_uring write requests.\n\n**Technical Details:**\n\n- The fix involves checking for the `IOCB_NOWAIT` flag. If set, the code will first try a non-blocking attempt to acquire the superblock semaphore using `sb_start_write_trylock`. If the try lock fails, the function returns `-EAGAIN`.\n- If the `IOCB_NOWAIT` flag is not set, the existing blocking call to `kiocb_start_write` occurs.\n- The io_uring core will then handle the `-EAGAIN` return and attempt the blocking write to ensure forward progress.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n- The vulnerability is not triggerable by regular users due to the requirement of CAP_SYS_ADMIN for the filesystem freeze operation.\n- The provided content includes diffs of `io_uring/rw.c` and `io_uring/io_uring.c` files, showing the changes made to address the vulnerability in different kernel versions. The fix is the same for both files.\n- The fix was backported to stable kernel releases 5.10 and later.",

CWE-833, Deadlock, is a Base-level CWE and a child of CWE-667, Improper Locking. Since the vulnerability description explicitly mentions a **deadlock**, the more specific CWE-833 was chosen over its parent. The relationship between CWE-362 (Race Condition) and CWE-367 (TOCTOU Race Condition) was considered, but ultimately, the vulnerability aligns more closely with a Deadlock condition.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe833[\"CWE-833: Deadlock\"]\n    cwe667[\"CWE-667: Improper Locking\"]\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    cwe367[\"CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\"]\n\n    cwe833 -->|CHILDOF| cwe667\n    cwe367 -->|CHILDOF| cwe362\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe833 primary\n    class cwe667 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **missing NOWAIT check** which then leads to **deadlock**.\n\n1.  **Missing NOWAIT Check:** The io\\_uring subsystem doesn't check for the IOCB\\_NOWAIT flag.\n2.  **Blocking Attempt:** The system unconditionally attempts a blocking grab of the superblock rwsem.\n3.  **Deadlock:** A deadlock occurs when the freeze operation waits for previous writes to complete, but the writes are blocked, waiting for the freeze operation to release the rwsem.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause and the resulting weakness. The vulnerability description clearly states that the **missing NOWAIT check** leads to a **deadlock** situation. The Retriever Results highlighted CWE-833 (Deadlock) as a strong candidate, and the provided content summary confirms the presence of a deadlock condition due to improper synchronization.
