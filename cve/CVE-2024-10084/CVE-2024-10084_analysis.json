  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-10084\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability lies in the `CF7_get_post_var` shortcode within the Contact Form 7 \u2013 Dynamic Text Extension plugin. This shortcode allows retrieval of various post data, including title and content, based on user-provided parameters.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Insecure direct object reference (IDOR):** The plugin does not properly validate access permissions when retrieving post data using the `CF7_get_post_var` shortcode.\n- **Information Disclosure:**  The lack of access control allows unauthorized users to access the content of private and password-protected posts.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Unauthorized access to sensitive content:**  Attackers can retrieve the titles and content of private or password-protected posts that they should not have access to. This can expose sensitive or confidential information.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Shortcode exploitation:** The `CF7_get_post_var` shortcode is the primary attack vector. Attackers insert the shortcode with a post ID into a contact form or any area that parses shortcodes.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least Contributor-level access in WordPress.\n- **Knowledge of shortcodes:** The attacker must know how to use the plugin's shortcodes and know the ID of the post they want to access.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The vulnerability exists in all versions of the plugin up to and including 4.5.\n- The fix was released in version 4.5.1.\n- The Wordfence article provides a good summary of the vulnerability details.\n- The Trac link points to the vulnerable code section.",

The **root cause** is an authorization issue, which could be represented by CWE-862 [Missing Authorization] or CWE-863 [Incorrect Authorization]. Since the attacker is authenticated but can access resources they should not, CWE-863 is more appropriate. CWE-639 [Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key] is also applicable as the attacker uses the shortcode to access unauthorized resources, essentially bypassing authorization through a user-controlled key (the post ID in the shortcode). CWE-863 and CWE-639 are more specific than CWE-200 but are related, influencing the choice of CWE-200 as the main issue with the authorization as the rootcause.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n    \n    cwe639 -->|CHILDOF| cwe863\n    cwe863 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe863,cwe639 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **incorrect authorization** (CWE-863), leading to an **authorization bypass through a user-controlled key** (CWE-639) and finally resulting in **exposure of sensitive information** (CWE-200).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary. The key evidence is that the `CF7_get_post_var` shortcode allows authenticated attackers to extract the titles and text contents of private and password-protected posts they do not own. This indicates that there is an issue with authorization, where the plugin **does not properly validate access permissions** when retrieving post data. The retriever results also suggest CWE-200 [Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor], CWE-863 [Incorrect Authorization], and CWE-639 [Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key] as potential candidates.\n\nThe relationship graph shows that CWE-639 [Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key] is a child of CWE-863 [Incorrect Authorization], and both can lead to CWE-200 [Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor]. The selection of CWE-200 as the primary CWE is based on the direct impact of the vulnerability, while CWE-863 and CWE-639 are secondary issues that contribute to the vulnerability.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, as they accurately represent the weakness and its impact. CWE-200 [Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor] describes the outcome of the vulnerability, while CWE-863 [Incorrect Authorization] identifies the **root cause**, and CWE-639 [Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key] specifies how the authorization is bypassed.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.\n\n*Not Used:* This is not related to CSRF because it is not about verifying the origin of the request but rather about access control.\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Used:* While related to authorization, it is less specific than CWE-863 because it refers to the general lack of authorization enforcement.\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Used:* Although the post ID is externally controlled, the primary issue isn't the lack of verification of an assumed-immutable parameter, but the lack of authorization checks.\n\n## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Used:* This CWE is not applicable as the vulnerability is not related to file uploads.\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Used:* This is a secondary CWE.
