## CVE-2025-28169 Analysis

The provided content from gist.github.com_d6e8adc9_20250624_132742.html is **RELEVANT** to CVE-2025-28169. It details a vulnerability in BYD QIN PLUS DM-i vehicles running Dilink OS. The other two provided URLs from byd.com are unrelated and do not contain vulnerability information.

Here's an extraction of the relevant information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The `/system/priv-app/CanDataCollect` folder is accessible to regular users, allowing extraction and analysis of `CanDataCollect.apk`. The `com.byd.data_collection_notify` broadcast is not system-protected.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Incorrect Access Control
*   Lack of proper permission restrictions on sensitive data access.
*   Unprotected broadcast receiver allowing modification of CAN traffic upload URL.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Bypass of permission restrictions.
*   Obtaining confidential vehicle data via CAN Traffic Hijacking.
*   Remote analysis of the car's driving status.
*   Prevention of cloud data collection by setting the upload URL to null.
*   Remote CAN traffic collection by redirecting the upload URL to an attackerâ€™s domain.
*   Decoding of CAN traffic to infer vehicle status.

**Attack vectors:**

*   Installation and execution of a malicious app with normal permissions on the IVI system.
*   Exploitation of the unprotected broadcast receiver to modify the CAN traffic upload URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   Ability to install apps on the IVI system.
*   Reverse engineering skills to analyze `CanDataCollect.apk` and decode CAN traffic.
*   Network access to receive CAN traffic if redirecting to an attacker-controlled server.

**Mitigation or fix:**

The report states the vulnerability has been reported to and addressed by the manufacturer in the latest versions. (Specific details of the fix are not provided in the content).

**Additional Notes:**

The content provides significantly more detail than a typical CVE description, including specific file paths, code snippets (screenshots), and step-by-step exploitation instructions. It also includes a disclaimer stating the report is for informational purposes only and should not be used for malicious activities.
