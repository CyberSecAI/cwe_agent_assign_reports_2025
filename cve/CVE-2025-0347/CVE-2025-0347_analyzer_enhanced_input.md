## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-0347 Content

This content **RELATES** to a SQL injection vulnerability. It provides significantly more detail than a standard CVE description would.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of proper cleaning or validation of the "u_id" parameter in the `index.php` file. Attackers can inject malicious code through this parameter directly into SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   SQL Injection

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Unauthorized database access
*   Sensitive data leakage
*   Data tampering
*   Comprehensive system control
*   Service interruption

**Attack vectors:**

*   POST request to `/index.php` with a malicious `u_id` parameter.
*   No login or authorization is required.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to send crafted POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint. No authentication is required.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   Use prepared statements and parameter binding.
*   Input validation and filtering.
*   Minimize database user permissions.
*   Regular security audits.

**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**

*   **Affected Software:** code-projects.org "Admission Management System" in PHP 1.0
*   **Vulnerable File:** `index.php`
*   **Vulnerability Type:** time-based blind, boolean-based blind, error-based
*   **Payload Examples:** The content provides several example payloads for boolean-based blind, error-based, and time-based blind SQL injection attacks.
*   **Proof of Concept (POC):** A sample POST request is provided demonstrating the vulnerability.
*   **Screenshots:** Screenshots from `sqlmap` are included, showing successful exploitation.
*   **Submitter Information:** Includes the names of the researchers who discovered the vulnerability (梁敏贤，王乐) and their school (广州大学).
