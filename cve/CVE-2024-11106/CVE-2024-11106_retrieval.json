This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to extract sensitive data from posts that have been restricted to higher-level roles such as administrator.', key_phrases={'rootcause': '', 'weakness': ['Sensitive Information Exposure', 'information disclosure'], 'impact': 'extract sensitive data from restricted posts', 'vector': '', 'attacker': 'unauthenticated attackers', 'product': 'Simple Restrict WordPress plugin', 'version': 'up to and including 1.2.7', 'component': 'WordPress core search feature'}, reference_content='Based on the provided information, here\\'s an analysis of CVE-2024-11106:\\n\\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\\n\\nThe vulnerability stems from the Simple Restrict plugin\\'s failure to properly restrict access to content when using the WordPress core search functionality. Although the plugin restricts content on the front end, it doesn\\'t apply the same restrictions to search results.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\\n\\n*   **Inconsistent Content Restriction:** The plugin enforces content restrictions on page views, but not when content is accessed through the WordPress search feature.\\n*   **Lack of Authorization Checks in Search:** The search functionality does not check user permissions before displaying results, allowing unauthorized access to restricted content.\\n\\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\\n\\n*   **Sensitive Information Exposure:** Unauthenticated attackers can bypass content restrictions and access sensitive information from restricted pages by using the search function. This could include data intended only for administrators or specific user roles.\\n\\n**Attack Vectors:**\\n\\n*   **WordPress Search Feature:** The primary attack vector is the built-in WordPress search functionality. Attackers can craft search queries to locate restricted content.\\n\\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\\n\\n*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to be logged into the WordPress site to exploit this vulnerability. They can perform the attack from any location with access to the site\\'s search function.\\n\\n**Technical Details:**\\n\\n*   The vulnerability exists in Simple Restrict plugin versions 1.2.7 and earlier.\\n*   The fix implemented in version 1.2.8 addresses the lack of permission checks within the search functionality.\\n*   The `posts_args_search` function in `/public/class-simple-restrict-public.php` was introduced or modified to address the issue. This function modifies the query to exclude restricted pages.\\n* The `get_all_restricted_pages` function was also introduced in version 1.2.8. This function is used to get all the restricted pages, based on the permissions set.\\n\\n**Additional Notes:**\\n\\n*   The provided changelog highlights \"Fixed: Security Issue\" in versions 1.2.7 and 1.2.8, confirming the identified vulnerability was addressed.\\n*   The Wordfence article indicates this vulnerability is classified as a \"Sensitive Information Exposure\" issue.\\n* The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 5.3 (Medium).\\n* The fix was to modify the search query to exclude pages that the user does not have permissions to see.', similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {95:
