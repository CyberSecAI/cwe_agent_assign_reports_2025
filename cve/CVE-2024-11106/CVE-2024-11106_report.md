## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.95
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-200, representing the **sensitive information exposure**. A secondary contributing factor is **missing authorization** (CWE-862), which leads to this exposure. CWE-862 is a class-level CWE and represents a broader category of authorization issues, making CWE-200 a more specific and relevant classification.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authorization** (CWE-862) in the WordPress core search feature, allowing **unauthenticated attackers** to **extract sensitive data** from posts that should have been restricted, leading to **sensitive information exposure** (CWE-200).

## Summary of Analysis
The primary weakness is **Sensitive Information Exposure (CWE-200)** because the vulnerability's description explicitly states that "unauthenticated attackers to extract sensitive data from posts that have been restricted to higher-level roles such as administrator." This aligns directly with the definition of CWE-200: "The product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information." A contributing factor is **Missing Authorization (CWE-862)** because the WordPress plugin lacks proper authorization checks within the core search feature, which results in the exposure of sensitive information.

The analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and keyphrase analysis. The graph relationships confirm that **missing authorization** can lead to **sensitive information exposure**. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-200 accurately reflects the impact of the vulnerability, and CWE-862 explains the root cause.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
**Abstraction Level**: Compound
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.



## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.

- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties
