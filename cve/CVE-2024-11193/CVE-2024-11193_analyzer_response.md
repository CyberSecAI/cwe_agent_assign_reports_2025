## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that influenced the CWE selection is the parent-child relationship between CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) and CWE-532 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File). While CWE-200 describes the impact, CWE-532 more accurately describes the root cause of the vulnerability. The application **inserted sensitive information into a log file**, leading to potential exposure. Therefore, CWE-532 is the more specific and appropriate choice.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **insertion of the sensitive LDAP bind password into the application logs (CWE-532)**. This then leads to the **exposure of sensitive information to unauthorized actors who have access to the logs (CWE-200)**.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis considered both CWE-532 and CWE-200. However, after careful consideration of the vulnerability description and the CWE specifications, it was determined that CWE-532 accurately captures the root cause of the vulnerability. The evidence from the vulnerability description and the CVE reference links clearly indicates that the LDAP bind password was being logged in plaintext within the application logs. This **insertion of sensitive information into the log file** is the primary weakness that led to the information disclosure.

The graph relationships show that CWE-532 can precede CWE-200, indicating that the insertion of sensitive information into the log file can lead to the exposure of that information. This further supports the selection of CWE-532 as the primary CWE.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-532 is a Base-level CWE that accurately describes the technical flaw, while CWE-200 describes the general impact of the vulnerability.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product writes sensitive information to a log file.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

**Evidence:** The **LDAP bind password is logged in plaintext within application logs.**

## CWE-90: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an LDAP Query ('LDAP Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of an LDAP query using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended LDAP query when it is sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

**Not Used:** This CWE is related to LDAP injection vulnerabilities, which is not the case here. The vulnerability is related to logging the LDAP password in plaintext.

## CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product generates an error message that includes sensitive information about its environment, users, or associated data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

**Not Used:** The sensitive information is logged in application logs and not necessarily in error messages.

## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-200 is commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error. As of CWE 4.9, over 400 CWE entries can lead to a loss of confidentiality. Other options are often available. [REF-1287].

**Evidence:** **This flaw results in the unintentional exposure of sensitive information in Yugabyte Anywhere logs, potentially allowing unauthorized users with access to these logs to view the LDAP bind password.**

## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

**Not Used:** The exposure is due to logging the password in plaintext rather than system-level access control issues.

## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

**Not Used:** While sensitive data is stored in logs, the core issue is the insertion of the sensitive data in the first place.

## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

**Not Used:** This is similar to CWE-532 but less precise. CWE-532 is specific to log files, which is directly relevant to the vulnerability.

## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

**Not Used:** This vulnerability is not related to the implementation of an authentication algorithm.

## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data
