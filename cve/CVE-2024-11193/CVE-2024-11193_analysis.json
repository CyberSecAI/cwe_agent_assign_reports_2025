  "description": "An **information disclosure vulnerability** exists in Yugabyte Anywhere, where the LDAP bind password is logged in plaintext within application logs. This flaw results in the unintentional exposure of sensitive information in Yugabyte Anywhere logs, potentially allowing unauthorized users with access to these logs to view the LDAP bind password.An attacker with log access could exploit this vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to the LDAP server, leading to potential exposure or compromise of LDAP-managed resources This issue affects YugabyteDB Anywhere from 2.20.0.0 before 2.20.7.0, from 2.23.0.0 before 2.23.1.0, from 2024.1.0.0 before 2024.1.3.0.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability fix:\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe root cause is the logging of the `ysql_hba_conf_csv` gflag value which contained sensitive information, specifically the LDAP bind password, during Gflag operations. This was happening when gflags were being upgraded.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n- **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the potential for information disclosure. The `ysql_hba_conf_csv` gflag, containing the LDAP bind password, was being logged in plaintext. This could expose the password to anyone who had access to the logs.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- If logs were compromised, an attacker could gain access to the LDAP bind password, potentially leading to unauthorized access to the system or data.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- An attacker would need access to the logs where the sensitive gflag was being logged.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- The attacker needs to have access to the logs generated by the YugabyteDB system where the unredacted `ysql_hba_conf_csv` value was being logged during gflag operations.\n\n**Details from the Patch:**\n- The fix introduces a redaction mechanism using `RedactingService` to filter secret fields before logging. Specifically, it adds `\"$..ysql_hba_conf_csv\"` to the list of fields to redact.\n- The changes are made in `TaskExecutor.java`, and `GFlagsUpgrade.java`, where logs containing gflag values are now sanitized before being written.\n- The `RedactingService.java` was modified to add the `ysql_hba_conf_csv` to the list of fields to be redacted.\n\nIn summary, the commit addresses the vulnerability by preventing the LDAP bind password from being logged in plaintext, mitigating the risk of unauthorized access via log data.",

While CWE-200 describes the impact, CWE-532 more accurately describes the root cause of the vulnerability.

However, after careful consideration of the vulnerability description and the CWE specifications, it was determined that CWE-532 accurately captures the root cause of the vulnerability. The evidence from the vulnerability description and the CVE reference links clearly indicates that the LDAP bind password was being logged in plaintext within the application logs. This **insertion of sensitive information into the log file** is the primary weakness that led to the information disclosure.\n\nThe graph relationships show that CWE-532 can precede CWE-200, indicating that the insertion of sensitive information into the log file can lead to the exposure of that information.
