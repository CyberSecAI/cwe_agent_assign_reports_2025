## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2024-7971:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a **type confusion** issue in the V8 JavaScript and WebAssembly engine within Chromium.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Type Confusion:** This occurs when the code incorrectly handles different data types, leading to unexpected behavior. In this case, it allows for memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the sandboxed Chromium renderer process.
*   **System Compromise:** Although initially limited to the renderer process, the attacker can further escalate privileges using other vulnerabilities. In the reported case, they use a sandbox escape (CVE-2024-38106) to gain kernel-level access.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Browser:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user visits a malicious website.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker used social engineering tactics to lure victims to the exploit domain (voyagorclub[.]space).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Host Malicious Web Content:** The attacker needs to host a web page containing the exploit for CVE-2024-7971.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to convince the victim to visit the malicious website.
*   **Chaining of Exploits:** The attacker also needs the ability to leverage a sandbox escape exploit to elevate privileges to kernel level (in this case CVE-2024-38106) .

**Additional details from the content:**

*   The vulnerability was exploited in the wild by the North Korean threat actor Citrine Sleet, targeting the cryptocurrency sector.
*   Exploitation leads to the deployment of the FudModule rootkit, which uses direct kernel object manipulation (DKOM) techniques to disrupt kernel security mechanisms.
*   The vulnerability affects Chromium versions prior to 128.0.6613.84.
*   Google released a fix on August 21, 2024.
*   Microsoft also released an update for CVE-2024-38106 to mitigate the full attack chain.
*   The article provides indicators of compromise (IOCs), hunting queries, and mitigation recommendations.
