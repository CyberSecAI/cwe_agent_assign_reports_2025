  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2024-7971:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\n*   The vulnerability is a **type confusion** issue in the V8 JavaScript and WebAssembly engine within Chromium.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Type Confusion:** This occurs when the code incorrectly handles different data types, leading to unexpected behavior. In this case, it allows for memory corruption.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the sandboxed Chromium renderer process.\n*   **System Compromise:** Although initially limited to the renderer process, the attacker can further escalate privileges using other vulnerabilities. In the reported case, they use a sandbox escape (CVE-2024-38106) to gain kernel-level access.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Web Browser:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user visits a malicious website.\n*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker used social engineering tactics to lure victims to the exploit domain (voyagorclub[.]space).\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Ability to Host Malicious Web Content:** The attacker needs to host a web page containing the exploit for CVE-2024-7971.\n*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to convince the victim to visit the malicious website.\n*   **Chaining of Exploits:** The attacker also needs the ability to leverage a sandbox escape exploit to elevate privileges to kernel level (in this case CVE-2024-38106) .\n\n**Additional details from the content:**\n\n*   The vulnerability was exploited in the wild by the North Korean threat actor Citrine Sleet, targeting the cryptocurrency sector.\n*   Exploitation leads to the deployment of the FudModule rootkit, which uses direct kernel object manipulation (DKOM) techniques to disrupt kernel security mechanisms.\n*   The vulnerability affects Chromium versions prior to 128.0.6613.84.\n*   Google released a fix on August 21, 2024.\n*   Microsoft also released an update for CVE-2024-38106 to mitigate the full attack chain.\n*   The article provides indicators of compromise (IOCs), hunting queries, and mitigation recommendations.\n\nThis content provides much more detail than the typical CVE description, including the specifics of the attack, the involved threat actor, and the steps for detection and mitigation.",
