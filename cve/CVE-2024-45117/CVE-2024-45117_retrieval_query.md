# Retrieval Query for CVE-2024-45117

# Vulnerability Description

    Adobe Commerce versions 2.4.7-p2, 2.4.6-p7, 2.4.5-p9, 2.4.4-p10 and earlier are affected by an **Improper Input Validation** vulnerability that could lead to arbitrary file system read. An admin attacker could exploit this vulnerability to read files from the system outside of the intended directories via PHP filter chain and also can have a low-availability impact on the service. Exploitation of this issue does not require user interaction and scope is changed.
