  "description": "In Eclipse Dataspace Components, from version 0.5.0 and before version 0.9.0, the **ConsumerPullTransferTokenValidationApiController does not check for token validity** (expiry, not-before, issuance date), which can allow an attacker to bypass the check for token expiration. The issue requires to have a dataplane configured to support http proxy consumer pull AND include the module transfer-data-plane. The affected code was marked deprecated from the version 0.6.0 in favour of Dataplane Signaling. In 0.9.0 the vulnerable code has been removed.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-8642:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from an incorrect implementation in the `ConsumerPullTransferTokenValidationApiController` of the Eclipse EDC. Specifically, the `TokenValidationService`'s `validate` method, which requires three arguments (token, public key resolver, and token validation rules), is called with only two arguments. The crucial third argument, which dictates the validation rules to be applied (including expiration checks), is missing, resulting in an empty list of rules. Consequently, only the token signature is verified, but not its expiration date.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Missing Expiration Check:** The primary weakness is the failure to enforce token expiration. The `ExpirationDateValidationRule` is not invoked, allowing expired tokens to be treated as valid.\n*   **Incomplete Token Validation:** The token validation logic is incomplete, as it only checks the signature, not other time-based constraints.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Confidentiality Breach:** Data can be pulled from the provider or data sources can be queried by the consumer, even if the token has expired and the consumer should no longer have access. This exposes potentially sensitive information.\n*   **Integrity Compromise:** Since \"data transfers\" in EDC can modify resources at the provider, attackers might be able to use expired tokens to make API calls (with payload) to the provider's data source, thus modifying resources beyond the permitted time window.\n*   **Indefinite Access:** If a token is leaked, unauthorized entities can use it to access or modify resources indefinitely.\n*   **Bypassing Permissions:** The vulnerability enables bypassing the intended permissions and access controls tied to token expiration.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Consumer Pull Endpoint:** The attack vector is the public (consumer pull) endpoint at the provider side.\n*   **Expired Token Usage:** An attacker with a valid but expired token can continue using it to access data or interact with the provider's resources.\n*   **Leaked Token Exploitation**: If a token is leaked, it can be used to access resources even by parties not intended to have access.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Access to Consumer System:** The attacker needs access to a consumer system that has negotiated a contract agreement with a provider, and that has obtained an EDR (with a token) using the http proxy consumer pull method.\n*   **Valid but Expired Token:** The attacker must have obtained a valid token at some point, which has since expired.\n*  **Configuration of Http Proxy Feature**: For attacks threatening integrity, the proxyMethod/Path/Payload/... configuration needs to be enabled for the asset.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n*   The vulnerability is located in the `ConsumerPullTransferTokenValidationApiController` within the `org.eclipse.edc:transfer-data-plane` maven artifact.\n*   The issue was introduced with version v0.5.0 of Eclipse EDC and remains in the main branch.\n*   The vulnerability can be reproduced using the sample provided, if the correct version is used.\n*   Mitigation involves blocking access to the public consumer pull endpoint until a fix is available.\n*   The fix includes switching to `data-plane-public-api-v2` which does not use the vulnerable `ConsumerPullTransferTokenValidationApiController`.\n*   CVSS score: CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:L/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:L/SC:H/SI:H/SA:L - 5.6 (Medium)\n\nThe provided information is more detailed than a typical CVE description, outlining the exact code location, the root cause and impact, making it more valuable for analysis.",

CWE-613 Insufficient Session Expiration is a base-level CWE and is a child of CWE-287. The relationship is that insufficient session expiration is one way that improper authentication can manifest.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe613[\"CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration\"]\n\n    cwe613 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe287 primary\n    class cwe613 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **ConsumerPullTransferTokenValidationApiController does not check for token validity**, leading to the **bypass check for token expiration**, which allows an attacker to access data or modify resources even with an expired token.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified the **root cause** as the `ConsumerPullTransferTokenValidationApiController does not check for token validity`, allowing an attacker to **bypass the check for token expiration**. The CVE reference elaborates that the `TokenValidationService`'s `validate` method is called with insufficient arguments, leading to the omission of the `ExpirationDateValidationRule`.\n\nThe primary CWE candidate is CWE-287 Improper Authentication, as the system **does not properly** validate the token's **validity** (expiry, not-before, issuance date). This aligns with CWE-287's description: \"When an actor claims to have a given identity, the product does not prove or insufficiently proves that the claim is correct.\"\n\nCWE-613 Insufficient Session Expiration is also relevant because the **token validity** check is related to the token's lifetime. By not enforcing the expiration, the system effectively allows expired sessions (tokens) to remain active. The description of CWE-613 is \"Insufficient Session Expiration is when a web site permits an attacker to reuse old session credentials or session IDs for authorization.\"\n\nThe selection of CWE-287 is based on the core authentication failure. CWE-613 specifies the nature of the authentication bypass, which is related to the token's validity/expiration.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
