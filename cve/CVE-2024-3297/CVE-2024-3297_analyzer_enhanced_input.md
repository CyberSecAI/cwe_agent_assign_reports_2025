## Vulnerability Description
An issue in the Certificate Authenticated Session Establishment (CASE) protocol for establishing secure sessions between two devices, as implemented in the Matter protocol versions before Matter 1.1 allows an attacker to replay manipulated CASE Sigma1 messages to make the device unresponsive until the device is power-cycled.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **replay attack**
- **impact:** device unresponsiveness
- **vector:** manipulated CASE Sigma1 messages
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** Matter protocol
- **version:** before 1.1
- **component:** Certificate Authenticated Session Establishment (CASE) protocol

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An issue in the Certificate Authenticated Session Establishment (CASE) protocol implementation within the Matter protocol. Specifically, the vulnerability arises from the lack of proper handling of replayed CASE Sigma1 messages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary vulnerability is the susceptibility to replay attacks using manipulated CASE Sigma1 messages. This lack of replay protection allows an attacker to trigger a denial-of-service condition.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation leads to device unresponsiveness, requiring a power cycle to restore normal operation. This constitutes a denial-of-service attack.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based, specifically exploiting the CASE protocol over the network. An attacker replays manipulated CASE Sigma1 messages.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be adjacent to the target device to be able to intercept and replay messages. No specific privileges are required and no user interaction is needed.
