## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content is related to CVE-2024-7294.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to the lack of rate limiting on anonymous endpoints in Telerik Report Server. This allows an attacker to exhaust server resources through excessive requests, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **CWE-400:** Uncontrolled Resource Consumption. The server does not properly manage the rate of incoming requests, leading to resource exhaustion.
*   Lack of rate limiting on anonymous endpoints.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   HTTP Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack. The server becomes unavailable, disrupting services.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   HTTP requests to anonymous endpoints.
*   Exploiting the lack of rate limiting by sending a high volume of requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Telerik Report Server.
*   No authentication required (anonymous endpoints).

**Affected Versions:** Telerik Report Server 2024 Q3 (10.2.24.709) or earlier.

**Solution:** Upgrade to Telerik Report Server 2024 Q3 (10.2.24.806) or later.
