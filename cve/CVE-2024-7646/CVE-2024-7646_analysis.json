  "description": "A security issue was discovered in ingress-nginx where an actor with permission to create Ingress objects (in the `networking.k8s.io` or `extensions` API group) can bypass annotation validation to inject arbitrary commands and obtain the credentials of the ingress-nginx controller. In the default configuration, that credential has access to all secrets in the cluster.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-7646:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability stems from a bypass in the annotation validation within ingress-nginx. Specifically, an attacker can inject carriage return characters (`\\r`) into Ingress object annotations, which are then not properly sanitized by the ingress-nginx controller. This allows the attacker to inject arbitrary commands.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Annotation Validation Bypass:** The ingress-nginx controller fails to properly sanitize or validate annotations, allowing the injection of malicious characters like carriage returns.\n*   **Command Injection:** The injected characters enable the execution of arbitrary commands on the system hosting the ingress-nginx controller.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Credential Theft:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain access to the credentials of the ingress-nginx controller.\n*   **Full Cluster Compromise:** In a default configuration, the compromised credentials have access to all secrets within the Kubernetes cluster, potentially leading to a full compromise of the cluster.\n*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the ingress-nginx controller.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Ingress Object Creation:** An attacker needs the permission to create Ingress objects within the Kubernetes cluster.\n*   **Malicious Annotations:** The attack involves creating Ingress objects with malicious annotations containing carriage return characters (`\\r`).\n*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Kubernetes API server to create the Ingress object.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Kubernetes Access:** The attacker must have the ability to create Ingress objects, typically in the `networking.k8s.io` or `extensions` API group, within the Kubernetes cluster. This implies some level of authorized access to the cluster, though not necessarily admin-level access.\n*  **Multi-tenant environment:**  Multi-tenant environments where non-admin users have permissions to create Ingress objects are most affected by this issue.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n*   **Affected Versions:**  ingress-nginx controller versions prior to v1.11.2 and v1.10.4 are vulnerable.\n*   **Mitigation:** The vulnerability can be mitigated by upgrading ingress-nginx controller to versions v1.11.2 or v1.10.4.\n*   **Detection:** Reviewing Kubernetes audit logs for Ingress objects created with annotations containing carriage returns (`\\r`) is a way to detect potential exploitation.\n*   The fix involves making the auth verify regex more strict and cleaning operations on line breaks.\n\nThis information is more detailed than the initial CVE description, providing specifics about the attack vector, the vulnerable component, and the nature of the injected commands.",

I initially considered CWE-285 (Improper Authorization), but CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) is a more specific child of CWE-284 and fits the description better. I also considered the CANPRECEDE relationship of CWE-120 to CWE-787, but that was not applicable to this vulnerability. The chosen CWE, CWE-863, is a Class, and while a more specific Base or Variant would be ideal, the available information doesn't support a narrower classification.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe74 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **incorrect authorization** check (CWE-863). An attacker bypasses annotation validation, injecting arbitrary commands to obtain credentials, and then has access to all secrets in the cluster which results in arbitrary command execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary assessment is heavily based on the provided evidence, specifically the CVE Reference Links Content Summary and Vulnerability Description Key Phrases. The evidence highlights that the vulnerability stems from a bypass in annotation validation within ingress-nginx, allowing injection of carriage return characters and subsequent command execution.\n\nThe selection of CWE-863 is based on the fact that the product performs an authorization check, but it is done incorrectly due to the validation bypass. This aligns with the definition of CWE-863.\n\nCWE-74, while relevant due to the injection aspect, is a high-level CWE. The more specific root cause is the **incorrect authorization** that allows the injection to occur in the first place. Therefore, CWE-863 is the primary CWE, representing the root cause, while CWE-74 can be considered a secondary weakness related to the injection mechanism.\n\nThe chosen CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity given the available information. While a more detailed Base or Variant CWE would be preferable, the current evidence doesn't allow for a more precise classification. The assessment relies heavily on the provided evidence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
