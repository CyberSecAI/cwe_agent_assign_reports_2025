# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-42109

## Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved netfilter nf_tables unconditionally flush pending work before notifier syzbot reports **KASAN slab-uaf** in nft_ctx_update include/net/netfilter/nf_tables.h1831 **KASAN slab-uaf** in nft_commit_release net/netfilter/nf_tables_api.c9530 **KASAN slab-uaf** int nf_tables_trans_destroy_work+0x152b/0x1750 net/netfilter/nf_tables_api.c9597 Read of size 2 at addr ffff88802b0051c4 by task kworker/11/45 [..] Workqueue events nf_tables_trans_destroy_work Call Trace nft_ctx_update include/net/netfilter/nf_tables.h1831 [inline] nft_commit_release net/netfilter/nf_tables_api.c9530 [inline] nf_tables_trans_destroy_work+0x152b/0x1750 net/netfilter/nf_tables_api.c9597 Problem is that the notifier does a conditional flush, but its possible that the table-to-be-removed is still referenced by transactions being processed by the worker, so we need to flush unconditionally. We could make the flush_work depend on whether we found a table to delete in nf-next to avoid the flush for most cases. AFAICS this problem is only exposed in nf-next, with commit e169285f8c56 (netfilter nf_tables do not store nft_ctx in transaction objects), with this commit applied there is an unconditional fetch of table->family which is whats triggering the above splat.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Weakness:** KASAN slab-uaf
- **Product:** Linux kernel
- **Component:** netfilter nf_tables

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-416 | Use After Free | 1.0 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-362 | Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') | 0.7 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship is that **CWE-416 (Use After Free)** can be a consequence of various other weaknesses. The vulnerability involves concurrent execution, which could lead to a race condition (CWE-362).

```

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with concurrent execution and improper synchronization, leading to a **use-after-free** condition.
  - **Root Cause:** Conditional flush of pending work without proper synchronization in a concurrent environment.
  - **Weakness:** **Use-after-free** when worker threads access freed memory.
  - **Impact:** Kernel panic and potential arbitrary code execution.

## Summary of Analysis
The primary **weakness** is **CWE-416 (Use After Free)**, which directly aligns with the reported **KASAN slab-uaf** error. The root cause is a race condition where a conditional flush doesn't properly synchronize access to a shared resource (a table being removed), potentially leading to a **use-after-free** when worker threads access the freed table.

The **use-after-free** condition is explicitly mentioned in the "**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**" section of the CVE Reference Links Content Summary. The evidence is strong and supports mapping to **CWE-416 (Use After Free)**.

CWE-362 (Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')) is considered as a secondary CWE because concurrency and synchronization issues contribute to the **use-after-free** condition. The evidence indicates that the **conditional flush** is not properly synchronized with worker threads accessing the table.

I considered other CWEs from the Retriever Results such as:

*   CWE-909 (Missing Initialization of Resource): While resource initialization issues can lead to vulnerabilities, the primary issue here is accessing a resource after it has been freed, not a missing initialization.
*   CWE-667 (Improper Locking): Though related to concurrency, the description focuses more on the locking mechanism itself, whereas this vulnerability is about the timing and lifecycle of the shared resource.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with **CWE-416 (Use After Free)** being a Variant that precisely describes the memory safety issue and **CWE-362 (Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition'))** being a Class that explains how the weakness occurred.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.

**Mapping Guidance**:
