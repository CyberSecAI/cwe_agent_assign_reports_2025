We could make the flush_work depend on whether we found a table to delete in nf-next to avoid the flush for most cases. AFAICS this problem is only exposed in nf-next, with commit e169285f8c56 (netfilter nf_tables do not store nft_ctx in transaction objects), with this commit applied there is an unconditional fetch of table->family which is whats triggering the above splat.",
