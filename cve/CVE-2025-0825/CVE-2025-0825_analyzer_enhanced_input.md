## Vulnerability Description
cpp-httplib version v0.17.3 through v0.18.3 fails to filter CRLF characters (\\r\\n) when those are prefixed with a null byte. This enables attackers to exploit **CRLF injection** that could further lead to HTTP Response Splitting, XSS, and more.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **vector:** CRLF characters prefixed with null byte
- **weakness:** **CRLF injection**
- **product:** cpp-httplib
- **impact:** HTTP Response Splitting, XSS
- **attacker:** attackers
- **version:** v0.17.3 through v0.18.3

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Here's an analysis of the provided content:

The content from `github.com_a1de0be9_20250624_165657.html` discusses a fix for an "HTTP Response Splitting Vulnerability" in the `cpp-httplib` library.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** HTTP Response Splitting. The fix aims to address a vulnerability where an attacker could potentially inject malicious content into HTTP responses. The provided code changes include checks to validate header names and values, preventing the insertion of invalid characters that could lead to response splitting.
*   **Mitigation or fix:** The commit introduces validation for header names and values using the `is_field_name` and `is_field_value` functions. These functions check if the provided header names and values conform to RFC specifications. The code also includes test cases to verify the fix.
*   **More detail than the official CVE description:** The content explicitly mentions the vulnerability type (HTTP Response Splitting) and provides code-level details about the fix. The official description placeholder is missing.
