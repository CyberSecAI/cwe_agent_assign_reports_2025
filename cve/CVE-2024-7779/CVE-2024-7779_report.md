# Summary

| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-1333 | Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-400 | Uncontrolled Resource Consumption | 0.7 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis

The primary relationship that influenced the decision was the direct match of the vulnerability description to the definition of CWE-1333, "Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity". The retriever results strongly support this mapping. The vulnerability description directly mentions "Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)" which aligns with the description of CWE-1333 consuming excessive CPU cycles.

## Vulnerability Chain

The vulnerability chain starts with the **inefficient regular expression** (CWE-1333). This leads to excessive CPU consumption, which results in a denial-of-service condition (CWE-400).
- **Root Cause:** CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity
- **Impact:** CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption

## Summary of Analysis

The initial analysis identified CWE-1333 as the primary weakness due to the explicit mention of "Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)". This aligns directly with CWE-1333's description of inefficient regular expression complexity leading to excessive CPU cycles. The retriever results also strongly supported this mapping with a score of 1.0.

CWE-400 was considered as a secondary impact of the vulnerability, as the excessive CPU consumption can lead to a denial-of-service condition. The relationship between CWE-1333 and CWE-400 is that the former *can cause* the latter.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-1333 is a Base level CWE, which is preferred for root cause analysis.
