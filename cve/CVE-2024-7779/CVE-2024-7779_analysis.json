The retriever results strongly support this mapping. The vulnerability description directly mentions \"Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)\" which aligns with the description of CWE-1333 consuming excessive CPU cycles.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1333[\"CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe1333 -->|CAN_CAUSE| cwe400\n    \n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1333 primary\n    class cwe400 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **inefficient regular expression** (CWE-1333). This leads to excessive CPU consumption, which results in a denial-of-service condition (CWE-400).\n- **Root Cause:** CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\n- **Impact:** CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-1333 as the primary weakness due to the explicit mention of \"Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)\". This aligns directly with CWE-1333's description of inefficient regular expression complexity leading to excessive CPU cycles. The retriever results also strongly supported this mapping with a score of 1.0.\n\nCWE-400 was considered as a secondary impact of the vulnerability, as the excessive CPU consumption can lead to a denial-of-service condition. The relationship between CWE-1333 and CWE-400 is that the former *can cause* the latter.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-1333 is a Base level CWE, which is preferred for root cause analysis.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to
