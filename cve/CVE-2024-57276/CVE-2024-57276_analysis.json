CWE-428 is a child of CWE-668, **Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere**, indicating a broader context of resource exposure. CWE-732, while named for permission assignment, often indicates missing checks, aligning with authorization weaknesses.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe428[\"CWE-428: Unquoted Search Path or Element\"]\n    cwe732[\"CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    \n    cwe428 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n    cwe428 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe732\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe428 primary\n    class cwe732 secondary\n    class cwe668 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **unquoted service path** (CWE-428), which allows for the potential execution of unintended code. This is compounded by **insecure permissions** (CWE-732) on the service executable, allowing attackers to replace it with a malicious one. This leads to privilege escalation, as the service runs with NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM privileges.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis identifies two key weaknesses: the **unquoted service path** and the **insecure permissions**. The primary weakness is the **unquoted service path**, as it sets the stage for the attack. The **insecure permissions** then allow an attacker to replace the executable. The evidence strongly supports CWE-428 **Unquoted Search Path or Element** as the primary CWE. CWE-732 **Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource** is a secondary CWE, reflecting the **insecure permissions** that enable the malicious executable to be placed.\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"In Electronic Arts Dragon Age Origins 1.05, the DAUpdaterSVC service contains an **unquoted service path** vulnerability.
