  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-2067 Content\n\nThis content **RELATES** to a vulnerability, but it's not directly tied to a CVE ID as the CVE description is a placeholder. It details a SQL injection vulnerability in \"Projectworlds Life Insurance Management System in PHP Project V1.0\". Here's a breakdown of the information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\n*   Insufficient user input validation of the 'key' parameter in the `/search.php` file. Malicious SQL queries can be injected directly into SQL queries without proper cleaning or validation.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   SQL Injection\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   Unauthorized database access\n*   Sensitive data leakage\n*   Data tampering\n*   Comprehensive system control\n*   Service interruption\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   The 'key' parameter in a POST request to `/search.php`.\n*   No login or authorization is required.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   An attacker needs to be able to send crafted POST requests to the `/search.php` endpoint. No authentication is required.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   Use prepared statements and parameter binding.\n*   Input validation and filtering.\n*   Minimize database user permissions.\n*   Regular security audits.\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   **Vulnerable File:** `/search.php`\n*   **Version:** V1.0\n*   **Software Link:** <https://projectworlds.in/life-insurance-management-system-in-php/>\n*   **Payload Examples:**  Includes time-based blind SQL injection and UNION query payloads.\n*   **POC:** Provides a `sqlmap` command example for exploitation.\n*   **Screenshots:** Includes screenshots from `sqlmap` output.\n*   **Vendor Homepage:** <https://projectworlds.in/free-projects/php-projects/online-examination/>\n*   **Submitter:** lql120",

There are no clear parent-child, chain, or peer relationships directly impacting the selection of CWE-89 in this specific case. The analysis focused on identifying the most specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability's root cause, leading to the direct selection of CWE-89 without needing to consider hierarchical or chain relationships.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe89 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') (CWE-89)** due to insufficient input validation of the 'key' parameter.\n2.  **Impact:** Unauthorized database access, sensitive data leakage, data tampering, comprehensive system control, service interruption.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified **SQL injection** as the primary **weakness** based on the vulnerability description and CVE reference content summary. The manipulation of the argument \"key\" in the `/search.php` file directly leads to **SQL injection**.\n\nThe evidence is strong, based on the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section, which explicitly mentions \"**weakness: SQL injection**\" and \"**vector:** manipulation of the argument key.\" Further supporting evidence is found in the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary,\" which details the root cause as \"Insufficient user input validation of the 'key' parameter,\" and the **weakness** as \"**SQL Injection**\".\n\nThe Retriever Results further confirm this assessment, with CWE-89 being the top-ranked CWE with a score of 1.000. The graph relationships did not significantly influence the decision, as the evidence strongly supports CWE-89 as the direct and most specific classification.\n\nThe selection of CWE-89 is at the optimal level of specificity because it precisely describes the root cause of the vulnerability: the **improper neutralization** of special elements in an SQL command, leading to **SQL injection**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.
