This is a high-level Class that describes the broad category of resource exhaustion vulnerabilities. A more specific Base CWE that falls under CWE-400 is CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling, which describes the specific scenario where resources are allocated without proper limits.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe400 primary\n    class cwe770 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain involves the receipt of multiple consecutive PairReqNoInputNoOutput requests, leading to a state where the device becomes incapable of completing the pairing process, effectively causing a denial-of-service. The root cause is that the device does not properly handle or limit the number of pairing requests, leading to resource exhaustion.\n  - The device **fails to limit or throttle** incoming pairing requests (the **ROOT CAUSE**).\n  - The device then **consumes resources** with each pairing request.\n  - The device **runs out of resources**, so is incapable of completing further pairing requests.\n  - A denial of service **impact** occurs.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description indicates that the Microchip RN4870 device becomes incapable of completing the pairing process after receiving more than one consecutive PairReqNoInputNoOutput request. This suggests that the device is exhausting some resource, which prevents it from processing further pairing requests. This is consistent with CWE-400, Uncontrolled Resource Consumption. The evidence for this is the statement that \"the device becomes incapable of completing the pairing process\" after multiple requests.\n\nGiven that there is no direct evidence specifying the kind of resource being exhausted (CPU, memory, etc.) I will assign CWE-400 as the primary weakness. A more specific weakness, CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling, is a strong candidate as a secondary weakness because it is a likely root cause of resource exhaustion.\n\nI considered CWE-1334: Unauthorized Error Injection Can Degrade Hardware Redundancy, but this CWE describes the injection of errors to degrade hardware redundancy, which doesn't fit the description of this vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-696: Incorrect Behavior Order\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs multiple related behaviors, but the behaviors are performed in the wrong order in ways which may produce resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-134: Use of Externally-Controlled Format String\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a function that accepts a format string as an argument, but the format string originates from an external source.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly anticipate or handle exceptional conditions that rarely occur during normal operation of the product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
