  "description": "A vulnerability was found in PHPGurukul COVID19 Testing Management System 1.0. It has been classified as critical. Affected is an unknown function of the file /new-user-testing.php. The manipulation of the argument mobilenumber leads to **sql injection**. It is possible to launch the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. Other parameters might be affected as well.",
