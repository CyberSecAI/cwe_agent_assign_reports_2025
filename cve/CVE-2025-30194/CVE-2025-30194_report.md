# Analysis Report for CVE-2025-30194

# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2025-30194

## Description

When DNSdist is configured to provide DoH via the nghttp2 provider, an attacker can cause a denial of service by crafting a DoH exchange that triggers an **illegal memory access** (**double-free**) and crash of DNSdist, causing a denial of service. The remedy is upgrade to the patched 1.9.9 version. A workaround is to temporarily switch to the h2o provider until DNSdist has been upgraded to a fixed version. We would like to thank Charles Howes for bringing this issue to our attention.

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary

| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-415 | Double Free | 1.0 | Variant | Primary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis

The primary identified CWE is CWE-415 (**Double Free**). This is a variant-level CWE, offering a specific classification. Given the vulnerability description explicitly mentions a "double-free", selecting CWE-415 is appropriate. There are no clear parent-child or chain relationships that influence the selection in this case, as the description is very specific about the nature of the memory corruption.

```

## Vulnerability Chain

The vulnerability chain is straightforward:

1.  A specially crafted DoH exchange is sent to the DNSdist server.
2.  The crafted exchange triggers a **double-free** condition (CWE-415).
3.  The **double-free** leads to memory corruption and a crash, resulting in a denial of service.

The root cause is the **double-free** condition. The impact is a denial of service.

## Summary of Analysis

The analysis is based on the explicit mention of a **double-free** in the vulnerability description and supporting CVE details.

> "When DNSdist is configured to provide DoH via the nghttp2 provider, an attacker can cause a denial of service by crafting a DoH exchange that triggers an **illegal memory access** (**double-free**) and crash of DNSdist, causing a denial of service."

The evidence directly points to CWE-415 (**Double Free**). All retriever results considered the same, but given the clear evidence, CWE-415 is the most appropriate and specific choice. The selection is at the variant level of abstraction, which is suitable given the specificity of the vulnerability.

## CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
An algorithm in a product has an inefficient worst-case computational complexity that may be detrimental to system performance and can be triggered by an attacker, typically using crafted manipulations that ensure that the worst case is being reached.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions
