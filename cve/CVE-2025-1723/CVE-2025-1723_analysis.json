CWE-613 is a Base level CWE and a child of CWE-672 (Operation on Resource After Expiration).

The **root cause** is the **session mishandling**. The CVE summary states: \"ensuring that enrollment data is accessible only to the user whose session is currently authenticated\" which confirms that the session handling is the core of this vulnerability. This is a Base level CWE which is the preferred level of abstraction.\n\nCWE-287 (Improper Authentication) was considered as a secondary CWE because the impact of the vulnerability is account takeover, which could imply authentication issues. However, the root cause is session management and not directly an authentication flaw. Therefore, CWE-287 is only a potential consequence of the session mishandling.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such
