Additionally, both are children of **CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations Within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer)**, indicating a broader class of memory safety issues. The selection of these Base-level CWEs provides a detailed classification.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe125 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe125 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **Read/Write vulnerability** in the image decoding module, leading to potential out-of-bounds read and write operations (**CWE-125** and **CWE-787**). The ultimate impact is a potential affect on availability.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe vulnerability description indicates a **Read/Write vulnerability** in the image decoding module. The content summary from CVE-2024-54109 reinforces this, identifying the root cause as a \"Read/Write vulnerability in the image decoding module.\"\n\nThe primary CWE selected is **CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write)**, as the vulnerability involves writing data outside the intended buffer. A secondary CWE selected is **CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read)**, as the vulnerability involves reading data outside the intended buffer.\n\nThe retriever results also suggest considering **CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read)** and **CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write)**.\n\nThe relationship graph shows that both **CWE-787** and **CWE-125** are children of **CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations Within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer)**.\n\nThe selection of **CWE-787** and **CWE-125** at the Base level of abstraction offers a balanced representation of the **Read/Write vulnerability**.\n\nRelevant CWE

Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-123: Write-what-where Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nAny condition where the attacker has the ability to write an arbitrary value to an arbitrary location, often as the result of a buffer

well-formed - i.e., to comply with a certain syntax - but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input complies with the syntax.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 588.06\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs a calculation that can\n         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic\n         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than\n         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is\n         incremented to a value that is too large to store in the\n         associated representation. When this occurs, the value may\n         become a very small or negative number.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity",
