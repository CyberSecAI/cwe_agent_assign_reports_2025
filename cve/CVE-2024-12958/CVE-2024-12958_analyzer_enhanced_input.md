## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-12958 (Based on the content title and filename)

**Root Cause:**
- A SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `update_pro_details.php` file.
- The vulnerability is caused by the direct use of the `q` parameter in SQL queries without proper sanitization or validation. This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the lack of input sanitization which allows for SQL injection through the `q` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Database Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database.
- **Sensitive Data Leakage:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database.
- **Data Tampering:** Attackers can modify or delete data within the database.
- **System Control:** Attackers can potentially gain comprehensive system control.
- **Service Interruption:** Attackers could cause a disruption of services.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited through a crafted GET request targeting the `update_pro_details.php` file, specifically manipulating the `q` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected server.
- No specific prior access is mentioned in the provided information, suggesting this vulnerability can be exploited remotely without prior authentication.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is demonstrated with SQLmap, using specific payloads such as boolean-based blind injection, time-based blind injection, and UNION queries.
- Example payloads include:
    - `q=-4321' OR 2227=2227-- suOg`
    - `q=1' AND (SELECT 1204 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))eKSC)-- hyuq`
    - `q=1' UNION ALL SELECT NULL,CONCAT(0x716a7a7871,0x4750736d4e6a7958514a5841546943486b756a784f61436b6274417162797555774a7a596d4a434a,0x716a7a7671),NULL,NULL,NULL-- -`

**Suggested Fixes:**
- **Prepared Statements:** Implementation of prepared statements with parameter binding is suggested to separate SQL code from user input.
- **Input Validation:** Implement strict validation and filtering of user input data to conform to the expected format.
- **Regular Security Audits:** Regularly perform security audits to identify and fix potential vulnerabilities.
