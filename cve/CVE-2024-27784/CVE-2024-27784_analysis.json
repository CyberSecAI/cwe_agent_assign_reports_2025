While it's discouraged, the provided vulnerability description and key phrases directly mention it as the **weakness**. The Retriever Results also lists it as the top result. CWE-532 [Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File] and CWE-497 [Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere] are base-level CWEs and could be considered as more specific alternatives if the evidence strongly pointed towards those specific exposure mechanisms.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe532[\"CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File\"]\n    cwe497[\"CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\"]\n    \n    cwe532 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe497 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe532,cwe497 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **Multiple Exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized actor vulnerabilities [CWE-200]** due to insufficient access controls within API endpoints or logs. This leads to the exposure and retrieval of sensitive information by an authenticated remote attacker. The impact is the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-200 [Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor] as the primary weakness based on the vulnerability description. The key phrase explicitly states \"**weakness:** **Multiple Exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized actor vulnerabilities [CWE-200]**\". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also indicates \"**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor).\" Although CWE-200 is a class-level CWE and is generally discouraged, the description explicitly mentions it, and there isn't enough specific information to choose a more specific base-level CWE with complete confidence. The retriever results also lists CWE-200 as the top result with a score of 0.327.\n\nCWE-532 [Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File] and CWE-497 [Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere] are considered as secondary candidates due to the mention of \"log files\" and \"API endpoint\" in the vulnerability description, but there isn't enough information to promote them as the primary CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-200 is commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error.
