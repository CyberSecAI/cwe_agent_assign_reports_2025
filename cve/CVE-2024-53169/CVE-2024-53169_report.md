# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-53169

## Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved nvme-fabrics fix kernel crash while shutting down controller The nvme keep-alive operation, which executes at a periodic interval, could potentially sneak in while shutting down a fabric controller. This may lead to a race between the fabric controller admin queue destroy code path (invoked while shutting down controller) and hw/hctx queue dispatcher called from the nvme keep-alive async request queuing operation. This race could lead to the kernel crash shown below Call Trace autoremove_wake_function+0x0/0xbc (unreliable) __blk_mq_sched_dispatch_requests+0x114/0x24c blk_mq_sched_dispatch_requests+0x44/0x84 blk_mq_run_hw_queue+0x140/0x220 nvme_keep_alive_work+0xc8/0x19c [nvme_core] process_one_work+0x200/0x4e0 worker_thread+0x340/0x504 kthread+0x138/0x140 start_kernel_thread+0x14/0x18 While shutting down fabric controller, if nvme keep-alive request sneaks in then it would be flushed off. The nvme_keep_alive_end_io function is then invoked to handle the end of the keep-alive operation which decrements the admin->q_usage_counter and assuming this is the last/only request in the admin queue then the admin->q_usage_counter becomes zero. If that happens then blk-mq destroy queue operation (blk_mq_destroy_ queue()) which could be potentially running simultaneously on another cpu (as this is the controller shutdown code path) would forward progress and deletes the admin queue. So, now from this point onward we are not supposed to access the admin queue resources. However the issue heres that the nvme keep-alive thread running hw/hctx queue dispatch operation hasnt yet finished its work and so it could still potentially access the admin queue resource while the admin queue had been already deleted and that causes the above crash. The above kernel crash is regression caused due to changes implemented in commit a54a93d0e359 (nvme move stopping keep-alive into nvme_uninit_ctrl()). Ideally we should stop keep-alive before destroyin g the admin queue and freeing the admin tagset so that it wouldnt sneak in during the shutdown operation. However we removed the keep alive stop operation from the beginning of the controller shutdown code path in commit a54a93d0e359 (nvme move stopping keep-alive into nvme_uninit_ctrl()) and added it under nvme_uninit_ctrl() which executes very late in the shutdown code path after the admin queue is destroyed and its tagset is removed. So this change created the possibility of keep-alive sneaking in and interfering with the shutdown operation and causing observed kernel crash. To fix the observed crash, we decided to move nvme_stop_keep_alive() from nvme_uninit_ctrl() to nvme_remove_admin_tag_set(). This change would ensure that we dont forward progress and delete the admin queue until the keep- alive operation is finished (if its in-flight) or cancelled and that would help contain the **race condition** explained above and hence avoid the crash. Moving nvme_stop_keep_alive() to nvme_remove_admin_tag_set() instead of adding nvme_stop_keep_alive() to the beginning of the controller shutdown code path in nvme_stop_ctrl(), as was the case earlier before commit a54a93d0e359 (nvme move stopping keep-alive into nvme_uninit_ctrl()), would help save one callsite of nvme_stop_keep_alive().

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that influenced the decision was the hierarchical relationship between CWE-362 and its potential base-level children, and CWE-667 and its base-level children. While more specific CWEs exist, the evidence points towards a general race condition rather than a specific type. CWE-362 and CWE-667 are Classes, and the retriever results suggest considering base-level children, but the description doesn't provide enough specificity to pinpoint a more precise weakness.mermaid

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with a **race condition** (CWE-362) between the fabric controller admin queue destroy code path and the hw/hctx queue dispatcher. This **race condition** leads to a situation where the nvme keep-alive thread accesses the admin queue resource after it has been deleted, resulting in a kernel crash. The root cause is the **improper synchronization** of access to the admin queue, and **improper locking** (CWE-667) could also be a contributing factor.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the kernel crash. The vulnerability description clearly indicates a **race condition** between two code paths, which aligns with CWE-362. The keyphrase analysis further supports this classification, with CWE-362 consistently scoring highest across different aspects of the vulnerability.

The analysis also considered CWE-667 (Improper Locking) as a potential contributing factor, as **improper synchronization** often involves issues with locking mechanisms. However, the description does not provide explicit evidence of locking errors, so CWE-667 is considered a secondary candidate.

The selection of CWE-362 and CWE-667 is based on the evidence provided in the vulnerability description, particularly the emphasis on a **race condition** and the potential for **improper synchronization**. While more specific CWEs exist, the available information does not allow for a more precise classification. These selections are at the Class level, but the retriever results indicate that a lower-level child might be appropriate, but there's not enough information to go lower.

**Description**:
The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review

## CWE-366: Race Condition within a Thread
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
If two threads of execution use a resource simultaneously, there exists the possibility that resources may be used while invalid, in turn making the state of execution undefined.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
