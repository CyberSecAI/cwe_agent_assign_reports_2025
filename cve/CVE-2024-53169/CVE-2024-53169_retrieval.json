  "vulnerability_info": "VulnerabilityInfo(cve_id='CVE-2024-53169', description='In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved nvme-fabrics fix kernel crash while shutting down controller The nvme keep-alive operation, which executes at a periodic interval, could potentially sneak in while shutting down a fabric controller. This may lead to a race between the fabric controller admin queue destroy code path (invoked while shutting down controller) and hw/hctx queue dispatcher called from the nvme keep-alive async request queuing operation. This race could lead to the kernel crash shown below Call Trace autoremove_wake_function+0x0/0xbc (unreliable) __blk_mq_sched_dispatch_requests+0x114/0x24c blk_mq_sched_dispatch_requests+0x44/0x84 blk_mq_run_hw_queue+0x140/0x220 nvme_keep_alive_work+0xc8/0x19c [nvme_core] process_one_work+0x200/0x4e0 worker_thread+0x340/0x504 kthread+0x138/0x140 start_kernel_thread+0x14/0x18 While shutting down fabric controller, if nvme keep-alive request sneaks in then it would be flushed off. The nvme_keep_alive_end_io function is then invoked to handle the end of the keep-alive operation which decrements the admin->q_usage_counter and assuming this is the last/only request in the admin queue then the admin->q_usage_counter becomes zero. If that happens then blk-mq destroy queue operation (blk_mq_destroy_ queue()) which could be potentially running simultaneously on another cpu (as this is the controller shutdown code path) would forward progress and deletes the admin queue. So, now from this point onward we are not supposed to access the admin queue resources. However the issue heres that the nvme keep-alive thread running hw/hctx queue dispatch operation hasnt yet finished its work and so it could still potentially access the admin queue resource while the admin queue had been already deleted and that causes the above crash. The above kernel crash is regression caused due to changes implemented in commit a54a93d0e359 (nvme move stopping keep-alive into nvme_uninit_ctrl()). Ideally we should stop keep-alive before destroyin g the admin queue and freeing the admin tagset so that it wouldnt sneak in during the shutdown operation. However we removed the keep alive stop operation from the beginning of the controller shutdown code path in commit a54a93d0e359 (nvme move stopping keep-alive into nvme_uninit_ctrl()) and added it under nvme_uninit_ctrl() which executes very late in the shutdown code path after the admin queue is destroyed and its tagset is removed. So this change created the possibility of keep-alive sneaking in and interfering with the shutdown operation and causing observed kernel crash. To fix the observed crash, we decided to move nvme_stop_keep_alive() from nvme_uninit_ctrl() to nvme_remove_admin_tag_set(). This change would ensure that we dont forward progress and delete the admin queue until the keep- alive operation is finished (if its in-flight) or cancelled and that would help contain the **race condition** explained above and hence avoid the crash. Moving nvme_stop_keep_alive() to nvme_remove_admin_tag_set() instead of adding nvme_stop_keep_alive() to the beginning of the controller shutdown code path in nvme_stop_ctrl(), as was the case earlier before commit a54a93d0e359 (nvme move stopping keep-alive into nvme_uninit_ctrl()), would help save one callsite of nvme_stop_keep_alive().', key_phrases={'rootcause': ['race between fabric controller admin queue destroy code path and hw/hctx queue dispatcher', 'race condition'], 'weakness': '', 'impact': 'kernel crash', 'vector': '', 'attacker': '', 'product': 'Linux kernel', 'version': '', 'component': 'nvme-fabrics'}, reference_content=\"Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\\n\\n**Root Cause:**\\n\\nThe root cause is a race condition in the NVMe (Non-Volatile Memory Express) driver when shutting down a fabric controller. This race occurs between the code that destroys the controller's admin queue and the NVMe keep-alive operation, which runs periodically.\\n\\n**Vulnerabilities:**\\n\\n*   **Race Condition:** The core issue is a race condition between two operations:\\n    1.  The destruction of the admin queue during controller shutdown.\\n    2.  The NVMe keep-alive operation accessing the admin queue.\\n*   **Use-After-Free:** The race condition leads to a use-after-free vulnerability.  The keep-alive operation can attempt to access the admin queue after it has been freed by the controller shutdown process, resulting in a kernel crash.\\n*   **Incorrect Keep-Alive Stop:** The flawed logic was introduced by commit `a54a93d0e359` which moved the `nvme_stop_keep_alive()` function to a point in the shutdown sequence that occurs too late, after the admin queue is destroyed. This allowed the keep-alive operation to still be in flight while the admin queue was being destroyed.\\n\\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\\n\\n*   **Kernel Crash:**  Exploitation of the race condition leads to a kernel crash. The crash is caused by the keep-alive thread accessing memory that has already been freed.\\n*   **Denial of Service:**  The kernel crash would result in a denial-of-service condition, as the system would become unusable.\\n\\n**Attack Vectors:**\\n\\n*   **Controller Shutdown:** The vulnerability is triggered during the shutdown process of an NVMe fabric controller.\\n*   **Keep-Alive Operation:** The keep-alive operation, which is a background task, must be active and execute during the shutdown of the controller.\\n\\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\\n\\n*   An attacker would need the ability to initiate the shutdown of an NVMe fabric controller.\\n*   No special position/capabilities are needed, it is enough to trigger the shutdown sequence.\\n*   The attacker doesn't need to be local or remote. The vulnerability is in the driver.\\n\\n**Additional Details:**\\n\\n*   The provided commit messages and code diffs explicitly detail the race condition and the flawed logic that was introduced by commit `a54a93d0e359`.\\n*   The fix involves moving the `nvme_stop_keep_alive()` function to the `nvme_remove_admin_tag_set()` function, which is called before the admin queue is destroyed. This ensures that the keep-alive operation is stopped before the admin queue is freed.\\n\\n**Summary:**\\n\\nThis is a race condition leading to a use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's NVMe driver that can be triggered during the shutdown of a fabric controller. The vulnerability is caused by a flawed timing of the keep-alive stop, allowing the keep-alive thread to access freed memory and crash the kernel.\", similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {}, 'top_cwes_by_threshold': {}}}, similarity_summary=SimilarityInsight(consensus_cwe='', top_cwes=[], confidence_levels={}, total_samples=0), analysis='', analysis_with_relationships='', criticism='', resolution='', relevant_cwes=[{'metadata': {'doc_id': '362', 'name': \"Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\", 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'rootcause:race between fabric controller admin queue destroy code path and hw/hctx queue dispatcher', 'keyphrase': 'race between fabric controller admin queue destroy code path and hw/hctx queue dispatcher', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'rootcause:race condition', 'keyphrase': 'race condition', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'impact:kernel crash', 'keyphrase': 'kernel crash', 'type': 'impact'}, {'id': 'product:Linux kernel', 'keyphrase': 'Linux kernel', 'type': 'product'}, {'id': 'component:nvme-fabrics', 'keyphrase': 'nvme-fabrics', 'type': 'component'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(2242.915860339166)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '667', 'name': 'Improper Locking', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'rootcause:race between fabric controller admin queue destroy code path and hw/hctx queue dispatcher', 'keyphrase': 'race between fabric controller admin queue destroy code path and hw/hctx queue dispatcher', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'rootcause:race condition', 'keyphrase': 'race condition', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'impact:kernel crash', 'keyphrase': 'kernel crash', 'type': 'impact'}, {'id': 'product:Linux kernel', 'keyphrase': 'Linux kernel', 'type': 'product'}, {'id': 'component:nvme-fabrics', 'keyphrase': 'nvme-fabrics', 'type': 'component'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(2164.419136596087)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '606', 'name': 'Unchecked Input for Loop Condition', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product does not properly check inputs that are used for loop conditions, potentially leading to a denial of service or other consequences because of excessive looping.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'rootcause:race between fabric controller admin queue destroy code path and hw/hctx queue dispatcher', 'keyphrase': 'race between fabric controller admin queue destroy code path and hw/hctx queue dispatcher', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'rootcause:race condition', 'keyphrase': 'race condition', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'impact:kernel crash', 'keyphrase': 'kernel crash', 'type': 'impact'}, {'id': 'product:Linux kernel', 'keyphrase': 'Linux kernel', 'type': 'product'}, {'id': 'component:nvme-fabrics', 'keyphrase': 'nvme-fabrics', 'type': 'component'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(2138.077120240073)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '367', 'name': 'Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': \"The product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check.

    "enhanced_query": "# Vulnerability Description\n\n    In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved nvme-fabrics fix kernel crash while shutting down controller The nvme keep-alive operation, which executes at a periodic interval, could potentially sneak in while shutting down a fabric controller. This may lead to a race between the fabric controller admin queue destroy code path (invoked while shutting down controller) and hw/hctx queue dispatcher called from the nvme keep-alive async request queuing operation. This race could lead to the kernel crash shown below Call Trace autoremove_wake_function+0x0/0xbc (unreliable) __blk_mq_sched_dispatch_requests+0x114/0x24c blk_mq_sched_dispatch_requests+0x44/0x84 blk_mq_run_hw_queue+0x140/0x220 nvme_keep_alive_work+0xc8/0x19c [nvme_core] process_one_work+0x200/0x4e0 worker_thread+0x340/0x504 kthread+0x138/0x140 start_kernel_thread+0x14/0x18 While shutting down fabric controller, if nvme keep-alive request sneaks in then it would be flushed off. The nvme_keep_alive_end_io function is then invoked to handle the end of the keep-alive operation which decrements the admin->q_usage_counter and assuming this is the last/only request in the admin queue then the admin->q_usage_counter becomes zero. If that happens then blk-mq destroy queue operation (blk_mq_destroy_ queue()) which could be potentially running simultaneously on another cpu (as this is the controller shutdown code path) would forward progress and deletes the admin queue. So, now from this point onward we are not supposed to access the admin queue resources. However the issue heres that the nvme keep-alive thread running hw/hctx queue dispatch operation hasnt yet finished its work and so it could still potentially access the admin queue resource while the admin queue had been already deleted and that causes the above crash. The above kernel crash is regression caused due to changes implemented in commit a54a93d0e359 (nvme move stopping keep-alive into nvme_uninit_ctrl()). Ideally we should stop keep-alive before destroyin g the admin queue and freeing the admin tagset so that it wouldnt sneak in during the shutdown operation. However we removed the keep alive stop operation from the beginning of the controller shutdown code path in commit a54a93d0e359 (nvme move stopping keep-alive into nvme_uninit_ctrl()) and added it under nvme_uninit_ctrl() which executes very late in the shutdown code path after the admin queue is destroyed and its tagset is removed. So this change created the possibility of keep-alive sneaking in and interfering with the shutdown operation and causing observed kernel crash. To fix the observed crash, we decided to move nvme_stop_keep_alive() from nvme_uninit_ctrl() to nvme_remove_admin_tag_set(). This change would ensure that we dont forward progress and delete the admin queue until the keep- alive operation is finished (if its in-flight) or cancelled and that would help contain the **race condition** explained above and hence avoid the crash. Moving nvme_stop_keep_alive() to nvme_remove_admin_tag_set() instead of adding nvme_stop_keep_alive() to the beginning of the controller shutdown code path in nvme_stop_ctrl(), as was the case earlier before commit a54a93d0e359 (nvme move stopping keep-alive into nvme_uninit_ctrl()), would help save one callsite of nvme_stop_keep_alive().\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'race between fabric controller admin queue destroy code path and hw/hctx queue dispatcher'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1.
