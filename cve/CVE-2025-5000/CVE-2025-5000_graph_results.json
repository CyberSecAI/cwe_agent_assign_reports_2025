  "query": "A vulnerability was found in Linksys FGW3000-AH and FGW3000-HK up to 1.0.17.000000. It has been classified as critical. This affects the function control_panel_sw of the file /cgi-bin/sysconf.cgi of the component HTTP POST Request Handler. The manipulation of the argument filename leads to command injection. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",
