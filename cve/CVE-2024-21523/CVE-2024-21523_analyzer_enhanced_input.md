## Vulnerability Description
All versions of the package images are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) due to **providing unexpected input types** to several different functions. This makes it possible to reach an assert macro, leading to a process crash. **Note** By providing some specific integer values (like 0) to the size function, it is possible to obtain a Segmentation fault error, leading to the process crash.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **providing unexpected input types**
- **impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) and Segmentation fault and process crash
- **product:** package images
- **version:** All versions

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-21523:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation within the `node-images` library. Specifically, several functions do not properly handle unexpected input types (e.g., objects instead of numbers) or specific integer values (like 0).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Lack of input validation:**  The code fails to validate the types and values of arguments passed to various functions like `New`, `SetWidth`, `SetHeight`, `Resize`, `Rotate`, and `FillColor`. This leads to assertions failing and program crashes.
- **Segmentation fault:** Passing a zero value to the `size` function leads to a segmentation fault, indicating a memory access violation.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Exploitation of these vulnerabilities results in a crash of the Node.js process, effectively causing a denial of service. This makes the application unavailable to legitimate users.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Remote exploitation:** The vulnerability can be triggered remotely, as the affected functions are part of the API exposed by the `node-images` library.
- **Crafted input:**  Attackers can exploit this by providing unexpected input types (like objects) or specific values (like 0) to the vulnerable functions within the `node-images` library.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to supply input to the `node-images` library. This would typically involve interacting with the application using the library and controlling the values passed to the library's functions, which are typically arguments to function calls.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability was discovered by Alessio Della Libera.
- The vulnerability is present in version `3.2.4` of the `images` package for Node.js, and potentially earlier versions.
- There is currently no fix available for this vulnerability.

The vulnerable code is located in the `Image.cc` file of the `node-images` repository. The specific lines where the assertions fail are detailed in the provided PoC output. The gist file also contains a `poc.js` file with sample code to reproduce the issue using different functions, providing specific examples of the vulnerability.
