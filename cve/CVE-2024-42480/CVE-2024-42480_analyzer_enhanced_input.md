## Vulnerability Description
Kamaji is the Hosted Control Plane Manager for Kubernetes. In versions 1.0.0 and earlier, Kamaji uses an **open at the top range definition in RBAC for etcd roles** leading to some TCPs API servers being able to read, write, and delete the data of other control planes. This vulnerability is fixed in edge-24.8.2.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **open at the top range definition in RBAC for etcd roles**
- **impact:** read, write, and delete the data of other control planes
- **attacker:** TCPs API servers
- **product:** Kamaji
- **version:** 1.0.0 and earlier

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-42480:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the use of an "open at the top" range definition in the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) configuration for etcd roles within the Kamaji project. Specifically, the `rangeEnd` variable was set to `\0`, which in etcd signifies "everything that comes after" the specified key. This allowed a TCP (Tenant Control Plane) API server to potentially read, write, and delete data belonging to other control planes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Insecure RBAC Configuration:** The use of `\0` as the range end in etcd RBAC rules created overly broad permissions.
-   **Lack of Disjoint Permissions:** The RBAC roles created for each TCP were not properly isolated, leading to potential cross-tenant data access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Full Control Over Other TCPs Data:** An attacker who gains access to one control plane can potentially obtain full control over other TCP's data if they know the names of other TCPs using the same datastore.
-   **Data Breach and Manipulation:** The ability to read, write, and delete data from other TCPs can lead to data breaches, data corruption, and denial of service attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Compromise of a TCP:** An attacker could first compromise a Tenant Control Plane.
2.  **Knowledge of other TCPs names:**  The attacker needs to know the names of other TCPs that use the same datastore.
3.  **Access to API Server Certificates:** The attacker needs to obtain the user certificates used by the compromised control plane or the ability to configure the kube-apiserver deployment.
4.  **Modification of `etcd-prefix` Flag:** The attacker must be able to modify the Kubernetes API Server `--etcd-prefix` flag to point to another TCP's datastore key.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Initial Access:** The attacker needs initial access to at least one Tenant Control Plane (TCP).
-   **Configuration Control:** The attacker needs the ability to modify the Kubernetes API server's configuration, specifically the `--etcd-prefix` flag, or be able to obtain the user certificates.
-   **Knowledge of the system:**  The attacker needs to know the name of the other TCPs to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is present in Kamaji versions <= 1.0.0.
- The vulnerability has been fixed in the `edge-24.8.2` version.
- The fix involves using `etcdclient.GetPrefixRangeEnd(key)` to generate the range end, which ensures that the range is limited to the specific key prefix and does not include keys of other control planes.
