  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved usb gadget configfs Prevent **OOB read/write** in usb_string_copy() Userspace provided string s could trivially have the length zero. Left unchecked this will firstly result in an OOB read in the form `if (str[0 - 1] == \\n) followed closely by an OOB write in the form `str[0 - 1] = \\0`. There is already a validating check to catch strings that are too long. Lets supply an additional check for invalid strings that are too short.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n\n- The `usb_string_copy()` function in the Linux kernel's USB gadget configfs implementation did not properly validate the length of user-provided strings. Specifically, it failed to check for zero-length strings.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n\n- **Out-of-bounds Read:** If a zero-length string was provided, the code would attempt to read `str[0 - 1]`, resulting in an out-of-bounds read. This happens when checking for a newline character (`\\n`).\n- **Out-of-bounds Write:** Following the out-of-bounds read, the code would also attempt to write `str[0 - 1] = '\\0'`, resulting in an out-of-bounds write.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n- The out-of-bounds read/write could lead to memory corruption, potentially causing a kernel crash or other undefined behavior. In a more severe scenario, this could potentially be exploited for privilege escalation.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n- A user with the ability to interact with the USB gadget configfs interface can provide a crafted zero-length string.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n- The attacker must have the ability to interact with the USB gadget configfs interface.\n- No specific position/location is required, as long as the user can send the crafted input to the affected driver.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n- The fix adds a check to ensure the string length is greater than 0 which will return `-EINVAL` when a zero length string is provided. This prevents the out-of-bounds access.\n- The patch was backported to multiple stable branches of the Linux kernel, highlighting the wide impact of the issue.",

The root cause is the missing check for zero-length strings, which results in an out-of-bounds read and write. The primary weakness is the **out-of-bounds write (CWE-787)**, as it directly leads to memory corruption. **CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read)** is a secondary weakness, as it precedes the write. **CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input)** explains why the read/write occurs.\n\nThe selection of **CWE-787** is justified by the fact that the code attempts to write to a memory location outside the allocated buffer. This aligns with the description of **CWE-787**. The **OOB read/write** weakness is clearly documented in the Vulnerability Description Key Phrases and CVE Reference Links Content Summary.\n\nThe suggested CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because **CWE-787** and **CWE-125** are both base level CWEs, which are preferred. **CWE-1284** explains how the vulnerability started.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected*: While an integer underflow could potentially be related, the provided description focuses on out-of-bounds access due to missing length validation, making **CWE-191** less directly relevant.\n\n## CWE-134: Use of Externally-Controlled Format String\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a function that accepts a format string as an argument, but the format string originates from an external source.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected*: This CWE is not relevant because the vulnerability is not related to format string usage.\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected*: While incorrect buffer size calculation can lead to out-of-bounds writes, the specific vulnerability is due to missing validation of the input string length, not the initial size calculation.\n\n## CWE-193: Off-by-one Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product calculates or uses an incorrect maximum or minimum value that is 1 more, or 1 less,

causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected*: This CWE is not the best fit as the problem is not specifically an off-by-one error, but the absence of a check for a zero-length string.\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Selected as Secondary*: The vulnerability description explicitly mentions an out-of-bounds read, making this CWE relevant as a secondary weakness.\n\n## CWE-130: Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product parses a formatted message or structure, but it does not handle or incorrectly handles a length field that is inconsistent with the actual length of the associated data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected*: While there's a length issue, it's not about inconsistency between length fields and actual data length, but a missing check for zero length.\n\n## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected*: This vulnerability doesn't involve uninitialized pointers.\n\n## CWE-1285: Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input that is expected to specify an index, position, or offset into an indexable resource such as a buffer or file, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the specified index/position/offset has the required properties.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Selected as Secondary*: This is relevant because the code does not validate the length of the provided string. But **CWE-1284** is more specific.\n\n## CWE-252: Unchecked Return Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not check",
