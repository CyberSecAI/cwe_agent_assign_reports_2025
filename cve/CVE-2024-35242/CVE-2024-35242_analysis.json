  "description": "Composer is a dependency manager for PHP. On the 2.x branch prior to versions 2.2.24 and 2.7.7, the `composer install` command running inside a git/hg repository which has specially crafted branch names can lead to **command injection**. This requires cloning untrusted repositories. Patches are available in version 2.2.24 for 2.2 LTS or 2.7.7 for mainline. As a workaround, avoid cloning potentially compromised repositories.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-35242:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from the way Composer handles version guessing when dealing with Git and Mercurial (hg) repositories. Specifically, when determining the version of a package, Composer executes shell commands using branch names as part of the command arguments. If an attacker can control these branch names, they can inject arbitrary commands, leading to command injection.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Command Injection:** The core weakness is the lack of proper sanitization or escaping of branch names when constructing shell commands. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code into the command string.\n*   **Insecure use of `str_replace`**: The code uses `str_replace` to inject branch names into the command. This is vulnerable to command injection as special characters in branch names are not escaped.\n*  **Use of shell commands**: The application uses shell commands to determine version information. This makes it vulnerable to command injection.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system running Composer. This can lead to:\n\n*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The attacker can gain full control of the system, enabling them to install malware, steal sensitive information, or disrupt services.\n*   **Data Breach:** The attacker can access and exfiltrate sensitive data stored on the system.\n*   **System Compromise:** The attacker can modify or delete system files, causing significant damage.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Malicious Repository:** An attacker can create a Git or Hg repository with specially crafted branch names.\n*   **Cloning Untrusted Repositories:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user clones a malicious repository and executes `composer install`.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Repository Control:** The attacker needs control over a Git or Hg repository.\n*   **User Interaction:** The attack requires a user to clone the attacker's malicious repository and run `composer install`.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n*   The fix involves passing the SCM command as an array, instead of as a string, which prevents the shell from interpreting special characters and commands from the branch names.\n*   The vulnerability is present in versions of Composer prior to 2.2.24 and 2.7.7.\n*   The vulnerability is rated as High severity.\n*  The vulnerability affects both git and hg repositories.\n* The vulnerability can be triggered by cloning an untrusted repository.\n\nThis analysis is based on the provided content, which includes the commit diffs, and the security advisory.",

CWE-78 is a child of CWE-77, which is a class-level CWE and represents a broader category of command injection. Since the vulnerability involves the injection of OS commands specifically, CWE-78 is chosen for its greater specificity.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')\"]\n    \n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe77 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper handling of branch names** within Git/Hg repositories by Composer. This leads to the **construction of a command string with malicious elements**, which results in **OS Command Injection** and ultimately, **arbitrary command execution** on the system.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is primarily based on the provided evidence, which clearly indicates that the vulnerability is a command injection issue due to **improper neutralization of special elements** in branch names when constructing OS commands. The evidence from \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" states that \"The core weakness is the lack of proper sanitization or escaping of branch names when constructing shell commands.\" The **weakness** is **command injection** due to \"specially crafted branch names\". The retriever results also list CWE-77 and CWE-78 as the top candidates. Given the specific context of OS commands being injected, CWE-78 is a more precise and appropriate classification than its parent CWE-77.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-88: Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs a string for a command to be executed by a separate component\nin another control sphere, but it does not properly delimit the\nintended arguments, options, or switches within that command string.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
