Several variants exist as children, such as CWE-80, CWE-81, and CWE-84. However, the description does not give enough information to use a Variant and the root cause is **Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation** aka Cross-site Scripting.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe80[\"CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\"]\n    cwe81[\"CWE-81: Improper Neutralization of Script in an Error Message Web Page\"]\n    cwe84[\"CWE-84: Improper Neutralization of Encoded URI Schemes in a Web Page\"]\n    \n    cwe80 -->|CHILDOF| cwe79\n    cwe81 -->|CHILDOF| cwe79\n    cwe84 -->|CHILDOF| cwe79\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe79 primary\n    class cwe80,cwe81,cwe84 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation** (CWE-79), which leads directly to the impact of Stored XSS.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states \"**Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation** (XSS or **Cross-site Scripting**)\" as the root cause. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also supports this by detailing multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities. However, the summary description indicates that the vulnerability is \"Stored XSS\".
