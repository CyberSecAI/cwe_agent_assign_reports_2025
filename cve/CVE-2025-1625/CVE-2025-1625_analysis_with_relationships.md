# Enhanced Analysis for CVE-2025-1625

# Summary

| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-79 | Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE. The plugin **does not validate and escape some of its Counter block options before outputting them back in a page/post where the block is embed**, which is a clear case of improper neutralization of input leading to XSS. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship considered here is the parent-child relationship. CWE-79 is a Base level CWE, which is the preferred level of abstraction. There are variant level CWEs that are children of CWE-79 (like CWE-80), but the description doesn't provide enough specifics to determine if it's related to HTML tags, so it would be better to stick to the base CWE.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **failure to validate and escape** user-supplied input in the Qi Blocks WordPress plugin, specifically within the Counter block options. This **missing input validation and escaping** (root cause) leads directly to the injection of malicious scripts. When a page or post containing this block is viewed, the injected script is executed, resulting in stored Cross-Site Scripting.

Root Cause: **Improper Neutralization of Input**
Impact: Stored Cross-Site Scripting

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is strongly based on the provided evidence, specifically the vulnerability description and the CVE reference summary. The key phrase "does not validate and escape some of its Counter block options before outputting them back" is a clear indicator of **Improper Neutralization of Input**, which aligns directly with CWE-79.

The retriever results also support this, with CWE-79 being one of the top candidates. The graph relationships confirm that we are selecting the appropriate base level CWE. We're not going to select a child CWE like CWE-80 because we have no evidence that the XSS is specifically related to HTML tags.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
**Abstraction Level**: Compound
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.

*Not Selected:* There is no evidence of CSRF in the vulnerability description.

## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

*Not Selected:* While the vulnerability description mentions a failure to "escape" output, CWE-116 is too general. The specific issue is the lack of neutralization of input before it's used in a web page, which is better captured by CWE-79.

## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.67
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected:* There is no evidence of missing authorization in the vulnerability description.

## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.66
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Selected:* This is the primary CWE.

## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.66
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected:* There is no evidence of unrestricted file uploads in the vulnerability description.

## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.66
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected:* There is no evidence that the application uses an incomplete list of disallowed inputs. It simply **does not validate and escape some of its Counter block options**.

## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.66
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected:* There is no evidence of the application using externally controllable web parameters in the vulnerability description.

## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.66
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as "<", ">", and "&" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected:* While this is a child of CWE-79, there is no evidence provided that the XSS is specifically related to HTML tags.

## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.66
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected:* There is no evidence of authorization bypass through user-controlled keys in the vulnerability description.

## CWE-862: Missing Authorization
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.66
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

*Not Selected:* There is no evidence of missing authorization checks.
