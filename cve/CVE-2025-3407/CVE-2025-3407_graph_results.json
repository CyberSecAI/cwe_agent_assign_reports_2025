  "query": "A vulnerability was found in Nothings stb up to f056911. It has been declared as critical. Affected by this vulnerability is the function stbhw_build_tileset_from_image. The manipulation of the argument h_count/v_count leads to out-of-bounds read. The attack can be launched remotely. This product takes the approach of rolling releases to provide continious delivery. Therefore, version details for affected and updated releases are not available. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",
