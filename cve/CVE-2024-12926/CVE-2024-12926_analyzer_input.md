## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content details a SQL injection vulnerability in the "Project Management System In PHP And MYSQL With Source Code".

- **Root cause:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input, specifically the `name` parameter, in the `/pages/forms/advanced.php` file. The application directly uses this unsanitized input within SQL queries.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** The core weakness is a SQL injection vulnerability. The application fails to validate or sanitize the `name` parameter before using it in a SQL query.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to unauthorized database access, sensitive data leakage, data tampering, complete system control, and service interruption.
