  "description": "A vulnerability classified as critical was found in Codezips Project Management System 1.0. Affected by this vulnerability is an unknown functionality of the file /pages/forms/advanced.php. The manipulation of the argument name leads to **sql injection**. The attack can be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. Other parameters might be affected as well.",

  "reference_content": "The provided content details a SQL injection vulnerability in the \"Project Management System In PHP And MYSQL With Source Code\".\n\n- **Root cause:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input, specifically the `name` parameter, in the `/pages/forms/advanced.php` file. The application directly uses this unsanitized input within SQL queries.\n- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** The core weakness is a SQL injection vulnerability. The application fails to validate or sanitize the `name` parameter before using it in a SQL query.\n- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to unauthorized database access, sensitive data leakage, data tampering, complete system control, and service interruption.\n- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through an HTTP POST request to `/pages/forms/advanced.php`. The attacker injects malicious SQL code into the `name` parameter.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application endpoint.\n\nThe provided content includes a detailed proof-of-concept (POC) demonstrating the vulnerability using `updatexml` function in the SQL injection. It also provides suggested fixes such as using prepared statements, input validation, and regular security audits.",

There are no specific child CWEs of CWE-89 that are more applicable.

The Retriever Results strongly support CWE-89 as the primary CWE.
