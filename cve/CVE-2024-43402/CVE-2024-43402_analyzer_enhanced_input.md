# Vulnerability Description

    Rust is a programming language. The fix for CVE-2024-24576, where `stdprocessCommand` incorrectly escaped arguments when invoking batch files on Windows, was incomplete. Prior to Rust version 1.81.0, it was possible to bypass the fix when the batch file name had trailing whitespace or periods (which are ignored and stripped by Windows). To determine whether to apply the `cmd.exe` escaping rules, the original fix for the vulnerability checked whether the command name ended with `.bat` or `.cmd`. At the time that seemed enough, as we refuse to invoke batch scripts with no file extension. Windows removes trailing whitespace and periods when parsing file paths. For example, `.bat. .` is interpreted by Windows as `.bat`, but the original fix didnt check for that. Affected users who are using Rust 1.77.2 or greater can remove the trailing whitespace (ASCII 0x20) and trailing periods (ASCII 0x2E) from the batch file name to bypass the **incomplete fix** and enable the mitigations. Users are affected if their code or one of their dependencies invoke a batch script on Windows with trailing whitespace or trailing periods in the name, and pass untrusted arguments to it. Rust 1.81.0 will update the standard library to apply the CVE-2024-24576 mitigations to all batch files invocations, regardless of the trailing chars in the file name.

    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'incomplete escape of arguments in batch files'

Relevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:

### 1. CWE-61: UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following (Score: 1203.98)

The product, when opening a file or directory, does not sufficiently account for when the file is a symbolic link that resolves to a target outside of the intended control sphere. This could allow an attacker to cause the product to operate on unauthorized files....

### 2. CWE-158: Improper Neutralization of Null Byte or NUL Character (Score: 1178.65)

The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes NUL characters or null bytes when they are sent to a downstream component....

### 3. CWE-88: Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection') (Score: 1170.68)

The product constructs a string for a command to be executed by a separate component
in another control sphere, but it does not properly delimit the
intended arguments, options, or switches within that command string....

### 4. CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs (Score: 1168.97)

The product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete....

### 5. CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following') (Score: 1166.85)

The product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource....
