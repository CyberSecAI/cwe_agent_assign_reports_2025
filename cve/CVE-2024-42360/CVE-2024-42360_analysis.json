  "description": "SequenceServer lets you rapidly set up a BLAST+ server with an intuitive user interface for personal or group use. Several HTTP endpoints did not properly sanitize user input and/or query parameters. This could be exploited to inject and run unwanted shell commands. This vulnerability has been fixed in 3.1.2.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-42360:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n- The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user inputs and query parameters in several HTTP endpoints of the SequenceServer application. This lack of proper input validation allows for the injection of shell commands.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Command Injection (CWE-77):** The core vulnerability is that the application executes shell commands using user-supplied data without adequate sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious commands into the arguments.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Successful exploitation enables attackers to execute arbitrary shell commands on the server hosting the application. This could lead to various impacts, including:\n    - Data breaches or exfiltration of sensitive information.\n    - System compromise, leading to full control over the server.\n    - Denial of service.\n    - Modification or deletion of data.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- HTTP endpoints: The attack vector is via HTTP requests to vulnerable endpoints. The attacker can manipulate query parameters or other input fields within these HTTP requests to inject malicious shell commands.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable SequenceServer application. This suggests that they need network access to the application. The attacker does not need any special user privileges to perform the attack.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The provided commit diff shows changes to validate sequence IDs and range parameters, indicating a direct effort to address the vulnerability by implementing more robust input validation.\n- The security advisory specifies that the vulnerability affects versions of SequenceServer prior to 3.1.2, and that version 3.1.2 includes a fix.\n- The advisory also mentions that there are no known workarounds, which makes patching the application the most effective way to remediate the vulnerability.",

The vulnerability description clearly indicates that the **improper input sanitization** leads to **command injection**, specifically OS commands. CWE-77 is a class-level CWE and a parent of CWE-78, representing a more general form of command injection. Given the specific context of OS commands being injected, CWE-78 is a more precise classification.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')\"]\n    \n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe77 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper input sanitization**, which is the root cause. This leads to the ability to inject and execute arbitrary OS commands on the server, resulting in potential data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service.\n\nImproper Input Sanitization -> OS Command Injection (CWE-78) -> Arbitrary Command Execution\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description explicitly mentions that the issue is related to **improper input sanitization** that allows for the injection and execution of unwanted shell commands. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms that the root cause is insufficient sanitization of user inputs, which leads to **command injection**.\n\nThe retriever results indicate that CWE-77 and CWE-78 are the most relevant CWEs, with CWE-78 being the more specific one. The relationship analysis shows that CWE-78 is a child of CWE-77. Given the description of the vulnerability, it is clear that the injected commands are OS commands, making CWE-78 the more accurate choice.\n\nThe provided evidence strongly supports the classification of this vulnerability as CWE-78, with a confidence score of 1.0. The evidence includes the vulnerability description, the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary,\" and the retriever results.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web server receives a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-93: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses CRLF (carriage return line feeds) as a special element, e.g. to separate lines or records, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CRLF sequences from inputs.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
