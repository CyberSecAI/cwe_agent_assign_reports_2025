# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-42360

## Vulnerability Description
SequenceServer lets you rapidly set up a BLAST+ server with an intuitive user interface for personal or group use. Several HTTP endpoints did not properly sanitize user input and/or query parameters. This could be exploited to inject and run unwanted shell commands. This vulnerability has been fixed in 3.1.2.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **improper input sanitization**
- **weakness:** **command injection**
- **impact:** execute unwanted shell commands
- **product:** SequenceServer
- **version:** before 3.1.2
- **component:** multiple HTTP endpoints

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-42360:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user inputs and query parameters in several HTTP endpoints of the SequenceServer application. This lack of proper input validation allows for the injection of shell commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection (CWE-77):** The core vulnerability is that the application executes shell commands using user-supplied data without adequate sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious commands into the arguments.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Successful exploitation enables attackers to execute arbitrary shell commands on the server hosting the application. This could lead to various impacts, including:
    - Data breaches or exfiltration of sensitive information.
    - System compromise, leading to full control over the server.
    - Denial of service.
    - Modification or deletion of data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP endpoints: The attack vector is via HTTP requests to vulnerable endpoints. The attacker can manipulate query parameters or other input fields within these HTTP requests to inject malicious shell commands.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable SequenceServer application. This suggests that they need network access to the application. The attacker does not need any special user privileges to perform the attack.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided commit diff shows changes to validate sequence IDs and range parameters, indicating a direct effort to address the vulnerability by implementing more robust input validation.
- The security advisory specifies that the vulnerability affects versions of SequenceServer prior to 3.1.2, and that version 3.1.2 includes a fix.
- The advisory also mentions that there are no known workarounds, which makes patching the application the most effective way to remediate the vulnerability.
