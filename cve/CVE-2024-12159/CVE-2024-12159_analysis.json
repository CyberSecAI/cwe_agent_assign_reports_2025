This aligns with CWE-425 (Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')), which describes the scenario where a web application does not adequately enforce authorization on restricted URLs, scripts, or files. The impact of this vulnerability aligns with CWE-359 (Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor).\n\nThe selection of CWE-425 is based on the fact that the **print_php_information.php** file should not be publicly accessible, indicating a **missing authorization** check. This aligns with the description of CWE-425, where authorization is not properly enforced. While CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) is also relevant, CWE-425 is a more specific Base-level CWE that better captures the nature of the vulnerability.\n\nCWE-359 is included as a secondary CWE since the impact of the vulnerability is the exposure of sensitive information.\n\nI considered the retriever scores, and the top CWEs include CWE-863, CWE-116, CWE-434, CWE-352, and CWE-306, but these do not accurately capture the root cause described in the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.\n\n\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
