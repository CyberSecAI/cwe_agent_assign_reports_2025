  "query": "A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in gaizhenbiao/chuanhuchatgpt, as of commit 20b2e02. The server uses the regex pattern `r]+>` to parse user input. In Pythons default regex engine, this pattern can take polynomial time to match certain crafted inputs. An attacker can exploit this by uploading a malicious JSON payload, causing the server to consume 100% CPU for an extended period. This can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition, potentially affecting the entire server.",
