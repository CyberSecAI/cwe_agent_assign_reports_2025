# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-30733

## Vulnerability Description
Vulnerability in the RDBMS Listener component of Oracle Database Server. Supported versions that are affected are 19.3-19.26, 21.3-21.17 and 23.4-23.7. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via Oracle Net to compromise RDBMS Listener. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized access to critical data or complete access to all RDBMS Listener accessible data. CVSS 3.1 Base Score 6.5 (Confidentiality impacts). CVSS Vector (CVSS3.1/AVN/ACL/PRN/UIR/SU/CH/IN/AN).

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-30733 based on provided content

**CVE Description:** The provided content details a memory leak in Oracle Transparent Network Substrate (TNS) protocol, allowing potential exposure of sensitive system memory to unauthenticated remote users.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a read of uninitialized memory within the Oracle TNS protocol when handling requests, specifically when a TCPS listener is configured.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Memory Leak/Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is a memory leak that exposes potentially sensitive data (environment variables, client information) due to reading uninitialized memory.
*   **Misconfiguration:** The vulnerability is exploitable when the `LOCAL_OS_AUTHENTICATION` setting is set to `OFF`, allowing external unauthenticated access.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:**  Exposure of sensitive system memory, potentially including environment variables and client data.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Remote, Unauthenticated:** An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending a specific request to a vulnerable Oracle database server over the network without authentication (if `LOCAL_OS_AUTHENTICATION` is disabled).
*   **TCPS Listener:** The vulnerability is triggered when the server is configured with a TCPS listener.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Oracle database server.
*   **No Authentication Required (with misconfiguration):** If `LOCAL_OS_AUTHENTICATION` is set to `OFF`, no authentication is required.

**Mitigation or fix:**
*   **Enable `LOCAL_OS_AUTHENTICATION`:**  The primary mitigation is to enable the `LOCAL_OS_AUTHENTICATION` setting to prevent unauthenticated external access.
*   **Patching:** Oracle released a patch in April 2025 (CPUAPR2025) to address the vulnerability.

**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**

*   The vulnerability was previously reported in a blog post in 2013, suggesting a potential regression.
*   Driftnet observed around 40 exposed servers globally, primarily running Windows.
*   The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specific request: `(DESCRIPTION=(CONNECT_DATA=(COMMAND=version)))`
*   Driftnet reported the issue to Oracle on February 28, 2025, and Oracle responded quickly with a fix.
*   The CVSS v3.1 Base Score is 6.5, but the authors note the limitations of CVSS scoring.
*   The blog post includes statistics on server locations, listener ports, and database versions affected.
