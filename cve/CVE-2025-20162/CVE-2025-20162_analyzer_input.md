# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-20162

## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability in the DHCP snooping security feature of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a full interface queue wedge, which could result in a denial of service (DoS) condition. This vulnerability is due to **improper handling of DHCP request packets**. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending DHCP request packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause packets to wedge in the queue, creating a DoS condition for downstream devices of the affected system and requiring that the system restart to drain the queue. Note This vulnerability can be exploited with either unicast or broadcast DHCP packets on a VLAN that does not have DHCP snooping enabled.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **improper handling of DHCP request packets**
- **impact:** denial of service (DoS) condition
- **vector:** DHCP request packets
- **attacker:** unauthenticated remote attacker
- **product:** Cisco IOS XE Software
- **component:** DHCP snooping security feature

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper handling of DHCP request packets.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A vulnerability in the DHCP snooping security feature of Cisco IOS XE Software.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated, remote attacker can cause a full interface queue wedge, leading to a denial of service (DoS) condition. This can cause packets to wedge in the queue, creating a DoS condition for downstream devices and requiring a system restart to drain the queue.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attacker can send DHCP request packets to an affected device. This vulnerability can be exploited with either unicast or broadcast DHCP packets on a VLAN that does not have DHCP snooping enabled.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Unauthenticated, remote attacker.
*   **Mitigation or fix:**
    *   Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability.
    *   Administrators can enable DHCP snooping on all VLANs using the `ip dhcp snooping vlan ?` command.
    *   Administrators can set a maximum hold-queue value greater than the currently configured value for the affected interface to allow traffic to pass until the device can be reloaded.
    *   Administrators can use a Cisco IOS Embedded Event Manager (EEM) policy to monitor and detect interface queue wedges.
