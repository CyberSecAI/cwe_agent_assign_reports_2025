  "description": "A vulnerability in the DHCP snooping security feature of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a full interface queue wedge, which could result in a denial of service (DoS) condition. This vulnerability is due to **improper handling of DHCP request packets**. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending DHCP request packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause packets to wedge in the queue, creating a DoS condition for downstream devices of the affected system and requiring that the system restart to drain the queue. Note This vulnerability can be exploited with either unicast or broadcast DHCP packets on a VLAN that does not have DHCP snooping enabled.",

CWE-20 is a class-level CWE, while CWE-129 is a variant. Given the information, we cannot pinpoint the exact type of input validation issue, so the higher-level CWE-20 is more appropriate.

Ultimately, this results in an **uncontrolled resource consumption** (CWE-400), causing a denial-of-service condition.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis indicates a vulnerability due to **improper handling of DHCP request packets**. The primary CWE is CWE-20 (**Improper Input Validation**), as the root cause lies in the software's failure to properly validate the input. The evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference links points to this **weakness**. The vulnerability can be exploited by sending DHCP request packets, leading to a full interface queue wedge and a denial-of-service condition for downstream devices. The selection of CWE-20 is further supported by the retriever results, although it is a Class-level CWE. However, given the general nature of the **improper handling**, a more specific CWE cannot be selected.
