# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-22104

## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ibmvnic Use kernel helpers for hex dumps Previously, when the driver was printing hex dumps, the buffer was cast to an 8 byte long and printed using string formatters. If the buffer size was not a multiple of 8 then a read buffer overflow was possible. Therefore, create a new ibmvnic function that loops over a buffer and calls hex_dump_to_buffer instead. This patch address KASAN reports like the one below ibmvnic 30000003 env3 Login Buffer ibmvnic 30000003 env3 01000000af000000 ibmvnic 30000003 env3 2e6d62692e736261 ibmvnic 30000003 env3 65050003006d6f63 ================================================================== BUG KASAN slab-out-of-bounds in ibmvnic_login+0xacc/0xffc [ibmvnic] Read of size 8 at addr c0000001331a9aa8 by task ip/17681 Allocated by task 17681 ibmvnic_login+0x2f0/0xffc [ibmvnic] ibmvnic_open+0x148/0x308 [ibmvnic] __dev_open+0x1ac/0x304 The buggy address is located 168 bytes inside of allocated 175-byte region [c0000001331a9a00, c0000001331a9aaf) ================================================================= ibmvnic 30000003 env3 000000000033766e
