# Raw Analyzer Response for CVE-2025-0187

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-770 | Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE: The **improper handling of form-data** with a large filename leads to excessive resource allocation without limits. |
| CWE-400 | Uncontrolled Resource Consumption | 0.7 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary CWE: The **improper handling of form-data** with a large filename leads to resource exhaustion and denial of service. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship is that CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) is a child of CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption). CWE-770 directly addresses the **lack of limits on resource allocation**, while CWE-400 describes the broader impact of **uncontrolled resource consumption** leading to DoS. Choosing CWE-770 provides more specific information about the vulnerability's root cause, as it explicitly mentions the **absence of limits or throttling**.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **improper handling of form-data** (CWE-770), which leads to excessive resource allocation. This, in turn, results in the server becoming overwhelmed and unresponsive, leading to a Denial of Service (CWE-400).
  - **Root Cause:** CWE-770 (**Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling**)
  - **Impact:** CWE-400 (**Uncontrolled Resource Consumption**)

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis focused on identifying the **root cause** of the Denial of Service vulnerability. The description clearly indicates that the vulnerability stems from **improper handling of form-data** with a large filename, leading to the server becoming overwhelmed. The retriever results suggested CWE-770 (**Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling**) and CWE-400 (**Uncontrolled Resource Consumption**).

CWE-770 is the more specific and appropriate choice because the vulnerability's description states that the server becomes overwhelmed due to the **improper handling of form-data** with a large filename, indicating that there are no limits or throttling mechanisms in place. This aligns directly with CWE-770's definition, which focuses on the absence of restrictions on resource allocation. CWE-400 is also considered because it describes the broader impact of resource exhaustion, but it is less specific about the root cause.

The evidence supporting CWE-770 is derived from the vulnerability description: "The vulnerability is due to **improper handling of form-data** with a large filename in the file upload request." This directly implies that the system is allocating resources without limits when processing the file upload request.

The hierarchical relationship between CWE-770 and CWE-400 further supports the choice of CWE-770 as the primary CWE. CWE-770 is a child of CWE-400, indicating that it represents a more specific type of resource consumption issue.

The final decision is based on the evidence from the description, the retriever results, and the hierarchical relationship between CWE-770 and CWE-400. CWE-770 is chosen as the primary CWE due to its specificity and direct alignment with the root cause of the vulnerability.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.66
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-941: Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.64
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product creates a communication channel to initiate an outgoing request to an actor, but it does not correctly specify the intended destination for that actor.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.64
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource, thereby enabling an actor to influence the amount of resources consumed, eventually leading to the exhaustion of available resources.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-400 is intended for incorrect behaviors in which the product is expected to track and restrict how many resources it consumes, but CWE-400 is often misused because it is conflated with the "technical impact" of vulnerabilities in which resource consumption occurs. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).

## CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.64
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allocates a reusable resource or group of resources on behalf of an actor without imposing any restrictions on the size or number of resources that can be allocated, in violation of the intended security policy for that actor.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.63
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web server receives a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.63

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
