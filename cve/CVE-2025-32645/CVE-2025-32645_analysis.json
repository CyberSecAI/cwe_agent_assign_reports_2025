Broken Access Control (OWASP Top 10 A1).\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\nA malicious actor can force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\nNot specified beyond being a CSRF attack.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\nUnauthenticated.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n- Remove and replace the software (Custom Posts Order plugin).\n- Deactivating the software does not remove the threat unless a vPatch is deployed.\n- No official fix available as of April 9, 2025.\n\n**Additional details:**\n- The software (Custom Posts Order plugin) is likely abandoned (last updated over a year ago).\n- Vulnerable versions: <= 4.4\n- CVSS score: 7.1 (Low severity)\n- Researcher: 0xd4rk5id3\n- Reported February 13, 2025, published by Patchstack April 9, 2025.\n\nThe content provides more detail than the placeholder CVE description.",

CWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')] is a secondary weakness, as the CSRF may be exploited to inject malicious scripts. CWE-352 is a compound weakness, composed of multiple other weaknesses related to request validation and session management. CWE-79, on the other hand, is a base-level weakness describing improper neutralization of input.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    \n    cwe352 -->|CAN_LEAD_TO| cwe79\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe352 primary\n    class cwe79 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** vulnerability, which allows an attacker to induce a user to perform actions against a web application that they are currently authenticated to. The CSRF vulnerability can then be exploited to inject malicious input, leading to Stored **XSS**, because the input is not properly neutralized.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that the \"Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in Hiren Patel Custom Posts Order allows Stored **XSS**\". This indicates that an attacker can use CSRF to inject malicious code into the system, resulting in stored **XSS**.\n\nCWE-352 [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)] is selected as the primary CWE because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions CSRF as the initial attack vector. The weakness \"cross-site scripting\" led to CWE-352 as the top match.\n\nCWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')] is selected as a secondary CWE because the CSRF vulnerability leads to stored **XSS**, which occurs due to improper neutralization of input. The weakness \"XSS\" led to CWE-79 as the top match.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-352 is a compound weakness that accurately represents the CSRF vulnerability, while CWE-79 is a base-level weakness that describes the improper neutralization of input leading to stored **XSS**. The evidence, combined with the retriever results, confirms that these CWEs are the most appropriate for this vulnerability.",
