## Vulnerability Description
An issue in Solar-Log 1000 before v2.8.2 and build 52-23.04.2013 was discovered to store plaintext passwords in the export.html, email.html, and sms.html files.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **plaintext password storage**
- **product:** Solar-Log 1000
- **version:** before v2.8.2 and build 52-23.04.2013
- **component:** export.html and email.html and sms.html files

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the storage of sensitive credentials (passwords for FTP, SMTP, and SMS services) in plaintext within configuration files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Unprotected Storage of Credentials:** Passwords for various services are stored in plaintext in accessible files.
- **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability leads to the disclosure of sensitive information.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers with access to the device can obtain plaintext passwords.
- **Compromise of Services:**  The stolen credentials can be used to compromise the associated FTP, SMTP, and SMS services.
- **Data Breach/Manipulation:**  Attackers could potentially gain access to data, modify system configurations, or send fraudulent messages.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Direct Access:** The primary attack vector involves direct access to the device's file system, where the vulnerable configuration files are stored.
- **Network Access:**  If the device is accessible on the network, an attacker might be able to exploit this vulnerability remotely. However, the description suggests that the device IP is needed for access.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Access to the Device:** Attackers need to gain access to the device's file system, either physically or through network access (if exposed).
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Files:** Attackers need to be aware of the specific files (`/export.html`, `/email.html`, `/sms.html`) where the plaintext credentials are stored.
- **Basic HTTP knowledge:** Attacker needs to be able to browse to the configuration pages to view the plaintext passwords

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in Solar-Log 1000 devices with firmware versions prior to 2.8.2 Build 52 - 23.04.2013
- The provided github content explicitly mentions "plaintext passwords are stored, potentially enabling unauthorized access to sensitive information"
- The content also notes that the filter "Server: IPC@CHIP" is useful when searching using the Shodan search engine
