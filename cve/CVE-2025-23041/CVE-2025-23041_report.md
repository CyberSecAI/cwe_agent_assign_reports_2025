# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2025-23041

## Description

Umbraco.Forms is a web form framework written for the nuget ecosystem. **Character limits configured by editors for short and long answer fields are validated only client-side, not server-side**. This issue has been patched in versions 8.13.16, 10.5.7, 13.2.2, and 14.1.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Rootcause:** Character limits configured by editors for short and long answer fields are validated only client-side, not server-side
- **Product:** Umbraco.Forms

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-1284 | Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input | 0.8 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE. The application **does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties**. |
| CWE-20 | Improper Input Validation | 0.6 | Class | Allowed | Secondary Candidate. Because it's a parent of CWE-1284, it's less specific. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship influencing the decision is the parent-child relationship between CWE-20 and CWE-1284. CWE-1284 is a more specific case of CWE-20. The vulnerability involves the **lack of server-side validation of character limits**, which directly relates to the improper handling of a specified quantity (the character limit) in the input.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **missing server-side validation** (**rootcause**), leading to the possibility of exceeding the intended field lengths.
Root Cause: **Missing server-side validation of input length**
Weakness: **Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input (CWE-1284)**
Impact: Exceeding field length limitations.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is primarily based on the provided vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary. The description clearly states that the character limits are only validated client-side and not server-side. This **lack of server-side validation** is the core issue.

The graph relationships influenced the selection by highlighting the parent-child relationship between CWE-20 and CWE-1284. While CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) is a broader category, CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input) is more specific and directly relates to the **improper handling of the character limit**.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-1284 directly addresses the **improper validation of a quantity (character length)**, which is the root cause of the vulnerability.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter

The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.67
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-134: Use of Externally-Controlled Format String
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.67
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a function that accepts a format string as an argument, but the format string originates from an external source.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.67
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
