## Analysis of CVE-2025-4363 Content

This content **RELATES** to a vulnerability, but it is not directly tied to a CVE with ID CVE-2025-4363 as the CVE description is a placeholder. It details a SQL injection vulnerability in itsourcecode Gym Management System V1.0. The content provides more detail than a typical CVE description.

Here's a breakdown of the extracted information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   Insufficient user input validation of the 'rid' parameter in `/ajax.php?action=end_membership`. The parameter is directly used in SQL queries without proper cleaning or validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   SQL Injection

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Unauthorized database access
*   Sensitive data leakage
*   Data tampering
*   Comprehensive system control
*   Service interruption

**Attack vectors:**

*   The `/ajax.php?action=end_membership` file is vulnerable.
*   The 'rid' parameter is the entry point for the attack.
*   No login or authorization is required.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
*   No authentication is required.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   Use prepared statements and parameter binding.
*   Input validation and filtering.
*   Minimize database user permissions.
*   Regular security audits.

**Payload Examples:**

*   Boolean-based blind SQL injection: `rid=(SELECT (CASE WHEN (9716=9716) THEN 10 ELSE (SELECT 3638 UNION SELECT 8705) END))`
*   Time-based blind SQL injection: `rid=10 AND (SELECT 5453 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))tXoL)`

**Affected Software:**

*   itsourcecode Gym Management System V1.0
