  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-4363 Content\n\nThis content **RELATES** to a vulnerability, but it is not directly tied to a CVE with ID CVE-2025-4363 as the CVE description is a placeholder. It details a SQL injection vulnerability in itsourcecode Gym Management System V1.0. The content provides more detail than a typical CVE description.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the extracted information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\n*   Insufficient user input validation of the 'rid' parameter in `/ajax.php?action=end_membership`. The parameter is directly used in SQL queries without proper cleaning or validation.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   SQL Injection\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   Unauthorized database access\n*   Sensitive data leakage\n*   Data tampering\n*   Comprehensive system control\n*   Service interruption\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   The `/ajax.php?action=end_membership` file is vulnerable.\n*   The 'rid' parameter is the entry point for the attack.\n*   No login or authorization is required.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint.\n*   No authentication is required.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   Use prepared statements and parameter binding.\n*   Input validation and filtering.\n*   Minimize database user permissions.\n*   Regular security audits.\n\n**Payload Examples:**\n\n*   Boolean-based blind SQL injection: `rid=(SELECT (CASE WHEN (9716=9716) THEN 10 ELSE (SELECT 3638 UNION SELECT 8705) END))`\n*   Time-based blind SQL injection: `rid=10 AND (SELECT 5453 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))tXoL)`\n\n**Affected Software:**\n\n*   itsourcecode Gym Management System V1.0\n*   Software Link: <https://itsourcecode.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Gym-Management-System-Project-in-PHP.zip>",
