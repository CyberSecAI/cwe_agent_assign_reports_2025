CWE-285 is a Class-level CWE for \"Improper Authorization,\" which is more specific than the Pillar-level CWE-284 \"Improper Access Control\". The description explicitly mentions \"**improper authorization**,\" guiding the selection toward CWE-285.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe285 primary\n    class cwe284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain consists of a single point: **improper authorization**. The provided description doesn't detail any preceding or subsequent weaknesses; it focuses solely on the authorization issue.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability based on the provided description. The key phrase \"**improper authorization**\" strongly suggests a problem with how the application manages user permissions and access to functionality. While CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) is a broader category, CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) is more specific and appropriate given the explicit mention of authorization issues.\n\nThe evidence is primarily based on the vulnerability description, which directly states \"**improper authorization**.\" The retriever results also list CWE-285, further supporting this selection.\n\nThe selection of CWE-285 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the stated authorization issue, without being overly broad (like CWE-284) or delving into implementation-specific details that are not provided in the description.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
