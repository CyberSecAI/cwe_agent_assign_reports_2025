  "query": "A vulnerability in the Redfish API of Cisco UCS B-Series, Cisco UCS Managed C-Series, and Cisco UCS X-Series Servers could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with administrative privileges to perform command injection attacks on an affected system and elevate privileges to root. This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation. An attacker with administrative privileges could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted commands through the Redfish API on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to elevate privileges to root.",
