  "description": "Werkzeug is a Web Server Gateway Interface web application library. Applications using `werkzeug.formparser.MultiPartParser` corresponding to a version of Werkzeug prior to 3.0.6 to parse `multipart/form-data` requests (e.g. all flask applications) are vulnerable to a relatively simple but effective **resource exhaustion** (denial of service) attack. A specifically crafted form submission request can cause the parser to allocate and block 3 to 8 times the upload size in main memory. There is no upper limit a single upload at 1 Gbit/s can exhaust 32 GB of RAM in less than 60 seconds. Werkzeug version 3.0.6 fixes this issue.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2024-49767:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n- The vulnerability lies in how Werkzeug, a Python web library, handles `multipart/form-data` requests. A specially crafted form body can bypass the `Request.max_form_memory_size` setting, leading to resource exhaustion.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Bypass of `max_form_memory_size`:** The core issue is that the `max_form_memory_size` setting, designed to limit the memory used when parsing form data, can be circumvented. This setting is intended to limit the size of individual (data) parts in a multipart form.\n- **Incomplete Resource Limitation:** While `Request.max_content_length` and deployment-level resource limits exist, they are not sufficient to mitigate this specific vulnerability which bypasses the `max_form_memory_size` setting.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation can lead to a denial of service, as the server consumes excessive resources parsing the malicious form data and it is unable to serve legitimate requests. The vulnerability is classified as a moderate severity issue, with a CVSS v4 score indicating a low impact on availability.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Network:** The attack vector is over the network (AV:N), meaning an attacker can exploit this remotely, without needing any special network access.\n- **Multipart Form Data:** The attack involves sending a specially crafted `multipart/form-data` request that bypasses the memory limits.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **No Privileges Required (PR:N):** An attacker does not need any special access or privileges to trigger the vulnerability.\n- **No User Interaction Required (UI:N):** The attack requires no interaction from a user other than sending the malicious request.\n- **Low Attack Complexity (AC:L):** The attack is of low complexity, meaning it is relatively easy to perform.\n\n**Technical Details:**\n- The fix involves applying the `max_form_memory_size` check not only in the `MultipartDecoder` (which handles individual events) but also in the `MultiPartParser` (which handles parsing the entire stream) to properly limit memory usage across multiple data events.\n- The fix is implemented in Werkzeug version 3.0.6 and Quart version 0.19.7.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n- The vulnerability is identified as GHSA-q34m-jh98-gwm2 in GitHub advisories.\n- NetApp products that use Werkzeug are also affected, and NetApp has released an advisory (NTAP-20250103-0007) for the vulnerability, listing affected products.\n- The fix for this vulnerability was also implemented in the Quart framework.\n\nIn summary, this vulnerability allows attackers to cause a denial-of-service by sending a crafted multipart form request that bypasses memory limits. The fix involves applying stricter checks on memory usage during form parsing.",

The product allocates memory based on a large size value from the untrusted data, but does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing excessive memory allocation. |\n| CWE-400 | Uncontrolled Resource Consumption | 0.5 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary Candidate. The product does not properly control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource, leading to resource exhaustion. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary weakness is CWE-770, which describes the allocation of resources without limits or throttling. CWE-789 is a more specific variant of CWE-770, describing memory allocation with excessive size values. CWE-400 is a broader class describing uncontrolled resource consumption, but it is discouraged for use when more specific CWEs are available.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe789[\"CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n\n    cwe789 -->|CHILDOF| cwe770\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe770 primary\n    class cwe789 secondary\n    class cwe400 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper handling of multipart/form-data requests**, leading to **uncontrolled memory allocation** (CWE-770), potentially due to an **excessive size value** (CWE-789) that bypasses intended limits. This then leads to **resource exhaustion** and ultimately a **denial of service**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-770 as the primary weakness due to the **lack of limits on resource allocation**. This aligns with the vulnerability description, which states that a crafted form submission request can cause the parser to allocate and block 3 to 8 times the upload size in main memory. The evidence \"A specifically crafted form submission request can cause the parser to allocate and block 3 to 8 times the upload size in main memory\" supports this.\n\nThe retriever results also suggested CWE-789, which is a variant of CWE-770, and describes memory allocation with excessive size values. While the vulnerability involves excessive memory allocation, the root cause is the **lack of limits on the allocation itself**, making CWE-770 the more accurate primary classification.\n\nCWE-400 was considered but ultimately deemed less specific than CWE-770, which directly addresses the allocation issue. MITRE guidance discourages the use of CWE-400 when more specific CWEs are available.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-770 at the Base level and CWE-789 as a Variant providing more details on the type of resource being exhausted.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates a reusable resource or group of resources on behalf of an actor without imposing any restrictions on the size or number of resources that can be allocated, in violation of the intended security policy for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nAn algorithm in a product has an inefficient worst-case computational complexity that may be detrimental to system performance and can be triggered by an attacker, typically using crafted manipulations that ensure that the worst case is being reached.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-1286: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input that is expected to be well-formed -
