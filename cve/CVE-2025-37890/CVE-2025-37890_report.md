# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2025-37890

## Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved net_sched hfsc Fix a UAF vulnerability in class with netem as child qdisc As described in Gerrards report [1], we have a UAF case when an hfsc class has a netem child qdisc. The crux of the issue is that hfsc is assuming that checking for cl->qdisc->q.qlen == 0 guarantees that it hasnt inserted the class in the vttree or eltree (which is not true for the netem duplicate case). This patch checks the n_active class variable to make sure that the code wont insert the class in the vttree or eltree twice, catering for the reentrant case.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Component:** net_sched hfsc class
- **Weakness:** UAF vulnerability, use after free
- **Product:** Linux kernel

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-416 | Use After Free | 1.0 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that influenced the decision was the direct match of the vulnerability description to the characteristics of CWE-416. While other CWEs like race conditions (CWE-362, CWE-367) and double free (CWE-415) were considered due to the concurrent nature and memory manipulation aspects, the explicit mention of "**UAF vulnerability, use after free**" strongly points to CWE-416 as the most accurate and specific classification.

```

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain is relatively simple:
1.  A **use after free** condition (CWE-416) exists in the net_sched hfsc class of the Linux kernel.
2.  The impact is potential memory corruption and unpredictable behavior due to accessing freed memory.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment, based on the provided evidence, directly aligns with CWE-416 (Use After Free). The vulnerability description explicitly mentions "**UAF vulnerability, use after free**," which makes it the most appropriate classification. The high retriever score for CWE-416 further supports this decision. The provided evidence is strong enough to select CWE-416 with high confidence.

**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-667: Improper Locking
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.

## CWE-252: Unchecked Return Value
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not check the return value from a method or function, which can prevent it from detecting unexpected states and conditions.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-617: Reachable Assertion
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product contains an assert() or similar statement that can be triggered by an attacker, which leads to an application exit or other behavior that is more severe than necessary.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-696: Incorrect Behavior Order
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product performs multiple related behaviors, but the behaviors are performed in the wrong order in ways which may produce resultant weaknesses.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense
