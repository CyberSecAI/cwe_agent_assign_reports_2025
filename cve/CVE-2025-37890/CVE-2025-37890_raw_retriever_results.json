  "query": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved net_sched hfsc Fix a UAF vulnerability in class with netem as child qdisc As described in Gerrards report [1], we have a UAF case when an hfsc class has a netem child qdisc. The crux of the issue is that hfsc is assuming that checking for cl->qdisc->q.qlen == 0 guarantees that it hasnt inserted the class in the vttree or eltree (which is not true for the netem duplicate case). This patch checks the n_active class variable to make sure that the code wont insert the class in the vttree or eltree twice, catering for the reentrant case.
