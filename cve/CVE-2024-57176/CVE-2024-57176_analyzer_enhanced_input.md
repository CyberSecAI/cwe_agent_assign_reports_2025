## Vulnerability Description
An issue in the shiroFilter function of White-Jotter project v0.2.2 allows attackers to execute a **directory traversal** and access sensitive endpoints via a crafted URL.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **directory traversal**
- **impact:** execute a directory traversal and access sensitive endpoints
- **vector:** crafted URL
- **attacker:** attackers
- **product:** White-Jotter project
- **version:** v0.2.2
- **component:** shiroFilter function

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The content relates to an incorrect access control vulnerability. Here's the extracted information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   A configuration error in the `ShiroConfiguration.java` file of the White-Jotter project v0.2.2. Specifically, the improper definition of filter chains in the `shiroFilterFactoryBean`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Incorrect access control due to flawed URL path matching rules in the Shiro configuration.
*   Directory traversal vulnerability allowing bypass of authentication filters.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Unauthorized access to resources that require authentication, such as `/api/admin/content/article`.

**Attack vectors:**

*   Constructing malicious URLs using directory traversal techniques (e.g., `/api/aaa;/../admin/content/article`) to bypass path matching rules.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   No authentication required. An unauthenticated attacker can exploit the vulnerability.
*   Knowledge of the application's URL structure and the Shiro configuration.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   The content does not provide specific mitigation steps, but implies the need to correctly configure the Shiro filter chain to prevent directory traversal bypasses.

**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**

*   The vulnerability exists in the White-Jotter project, a front-end and back-end separation project with 2.5k stars on GitHub.
*   The project uses Apache Shiro for authentication and authorization.
*   The vulnerability is demonstrated by successfully accessing `/api/admin/content/article` using a crafted URL (`/api/aaa;/../admin/content/article`) without authentication, while a direct access attempt with proper authentication fails.
*   The code snippet of `shiroFilter` function in `ShiroConfiguration.java` is provided.
*   Screenshots demonstrating successful bypass and server logs are included.
