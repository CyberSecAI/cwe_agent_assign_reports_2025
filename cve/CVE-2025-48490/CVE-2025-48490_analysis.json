  "description": "Laravel Rest Api is an API generator. Prior to version 2.13.0, a validation bypass vulnerability was discovered where **multiple validations defined for the same attribute could be silently overridden**. Due to how the framework merged validation rules across multiple contexts (such as index, store, and update actions), malicious actors could exploit this behavior by crafting requests that bypass expected validation rules, potentially injecting unexpected or dangerous parameters into the application. This could lead to unauthorized data being accepted or processed by the API, depending on the context in which the validation was bypassed. This issue has been patched in version 2.13.0.",

While the retriever results suggested several CWEs related to authentication and authorization, the core issue lies in the **improper validation** of input due to the **overriding** of validation rules. CWE-20 is a parent of more specific input validation CWEs, but none of those fit the specific scenario of validation rules being overridden. CWE-181 is related as it involves the order of validation.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe181[\"CWE-181: Incorrect Behavior Order: Validate Before Filter\"]\n    \n    cwe181 -->|PEEROF| cwe20\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe20 primary\n    class cwe181 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **incorrect** merging of validation rules, leading to **improper input validation**, which ultimately allows attackers to **bypass validation** and inject malicious parameters.\n  - **Root Cause:** Incorrect Merging of Validation Rules\n  - **Weakness:** CWE-20 Improper Input Validation\n  - **Impact:** Bypass of Validation, Injection of Malicious Parameters\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **root cause** of the vulnerability: \"**multiple validations defined for the same attribute could be silently overridden**\". This directly leads to **improper input validation**, making CWE-20 the most appropriate primary CWE, even though it's discouraged. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also supports this, stating the \"**weaknesses**\" as \"**Validation bypass, multiple validation rules for the same attribute could be overridden, potentially allowing malicious actors to inject unexpected or dangerous parameters.**\"\n\nCWE-181 was included because the validation happened in an incorrect order, that is, the **multiple validations defined for the same attribute could be silently overridden**, but it's a secondary candidate as that's not the core issue.\n\nThe selection of CWE-20 is at the optimal level of specificity because while there are more specific input validation CWEs, none of them describe the specific scenario of **validation rules being overridden** due to **incorrect** merging.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1286: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input that is expected to be well-formed - i.e., to comply with a certain syntax - but it does

Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism

data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-285: Improper Authorization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 576.81\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-285 is high-level and lower-level CWEs can frequently be used instead. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).\n\n## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 576.54\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review",
