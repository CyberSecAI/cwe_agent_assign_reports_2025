  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved nilfs2 fix nilfs_empty_dir() misjudgment and long loop on I/O errors The error handling in nilfs_empty_dir() when a directory folio/page read fails is incorrect, as in the old ext2 implementation, and if the folio/page cannot be read or nilfs_check_folio() fails, it will falsely determine the directory as empty and corrupt the file system. In addition, since nilfs_empty_dir() does not immediately return on a failed folio/page read, but continues to loop, this can cause a long loop with I/O if i_size of the directorys inode is also corrupted, causing the log writer thread to wait and hang, as reported by syzbot. Fix these issues by making nilfs_empty_dir() immediately return a false value (0) if it fails to get a directory folio/page.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**CVE Description:**\nThe provided text describes a vulnerability in the `nilfs_empty_dir()` function within the NILFS2 file system implementation in the Linux kernel.\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability stems from incorrect error handling within the `nilfs_empty_dir()` function. Specifically:\n\n1.  **Misjudgment of Empty Directories:** When a directory folio/page read fails (due to I/O errors or `nilfs_check_folio()` failure), the function would incorrectly determine the directory to be empty.\n2.  **Long Loop on I/O Errors:** The function didn't immediately return on a failed folio/page read, but instead continued to loop, potentially causing a long loop with I/O if the directory's inode `i_size` was also corrupted.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Incorrect Error Handling:** The primary issue is the failure to handle I/O read errors and `nilfs_check_folio()` failures correctly within `nilfs_empty_dir()`. This leads to false positives for empty directories.\n*   **Infinite Loop Potential:** Continuing to loop on failed folio/page reads, especially if the inode's `i_size` is also corrupted, can lead to an infinite loop condition, causing the log writer thread to hang.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **File System Corruption:** Incorrectly determining a non-empty directory as empty could lead to file system corruption.\n*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The long loop caused by I/O errors and a corrupted `i_size` can hang the log writer thread, leading to a denial-of-service condition.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\nThe vulnerability can be triggered through:\n\n*   **I/O Errors:** Introducing I/O errors during directory folio/page reads.\n*   **Corrupted Inode i_size:** Corrupting the `i_size` of a directory's inode.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   The attacker would need to be able to trigger I/O errors or corrupt the file system in a way that leads to the conditions described in the bug report. This might require root or system-level privileges, or a way to inject errors into the block layer of the system.\n*   The vulnerability would be present within the kernel, so exploitation would likely be local.\n\n**Fix:**\nThe fix involves modifying the `nilfs_empty_dir()` function to immediately return a false value (0) if it fails to get a directory folio/page, preventing both the misjudgment of empty directories and the long loop.\n\n```diff\n--- a/fs/nilfs2/dir.c\n+++ b/fs/nilfs2/dir.c\n@@ -627,7 +627,7 @@\n int nilfs_empty_dir(struct inode *inode)\n {\n \tkaddr = nilfs_get_page(inode, i, &page);\n-\tif (IS_ERR(kaddr))\n-\t\tcontinue;\n+\tif (IS_ERR(kaddr))\t\n+\t\treturn 0;\n \tde = (struct nilfs_dir_entry *)kaddr;\n \tkaddr += nilfs_last_byte(inode, i) - NILFS_DIR_REC_LEN(1);\n```\n\nThis change ensures that the function returns `0` (false) immediately upon a page read error, resolving the identified issues.",
