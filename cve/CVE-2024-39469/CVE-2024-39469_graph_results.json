  "query": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved nilfs2 fix nilfs_empty_dir() misjudgment and long loop on I/O errors The error handling in nilfs_empty_dir() when a directory folio/page read fails is incorrect, as in the old ext2 implementation, and if the folio/page cannot be read or nilfs_check_folio() fails, it will falsely determine the directory as empty and corrupt the file system. In addition, since nilfs_empty_dir() does not immediately return on a failed folio/page read, but continues to loop, this can cause a long loop with I/O if i_size of the directorys inode is also corrupted, causing the log writer thread to wait and hang, as reported by syzbot. Fix these issues by making nilfs_empty_dir() immediately return a false value (0) if it fails to get a directory folio/page.",
