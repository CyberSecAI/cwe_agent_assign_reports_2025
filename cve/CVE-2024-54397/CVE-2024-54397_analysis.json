The vulnerability description explicitly mentions both **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** and **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**, indicating that both weaknesses are present. There is no explicit parent-child relationship directly applicable in this specific context, but both CWE-352 and CWE-79 are related to web application security. The abstraction levels are appropriate, with CWE-352 being a Compound weakness and CWE-79 being a Base weakness.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe352 primary\n    class cwe79 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**, which allows an attacker to induce a user to perform actions they did not intend to perform. This can lead to stored **XSS** (Cross-Site Scripting) by allowing the attacker to inject malicious scripts into the application's data store, which are then executed when other users view the data.\n\nCWE-352 (Root Cause) -> CWE-79 (Impact)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the explicit statements in the vulnerability description, which mentions both **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** and stored **XSS**. The description states \"Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in Antonio Gocaj Go Animate allows Stored **XSS**.\"\n\nThis provides direct evidence for both CWE-352 and CWE-79. The graph relationships show that these are independent vulnerabilities in this instance. The retriever scores support the selection of these CWEs. Both CWEs are at an appropriate level of specificity, with CWE-352 as a Compound weakness and CWE-79 as a Base weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.

It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 3160.62\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
