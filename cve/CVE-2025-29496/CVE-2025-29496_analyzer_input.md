# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-29496

## Vulnerability Description
libming v0.4.8 was discovered to contain a segmentation fault via the decompileDUPLICATECLIP function. This vulnerability allows attackers to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) via a crafted SWF file.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** segmentation fault and Denial of Service
- **vector:** crafted SWF file
- **attacker:** attackers
- **product:** libming
- **version:** v0.4.8
- **component:** decompileDUPLICATECLIP function

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2025-29496 (assuming the CVE description would relate to vulnerabilities in libming):

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The content details multiple root causes:

*   **Out-of-memory errors:** Occur in `parseABC_NS_SET_INFO` and `parseABC_STRING_INFO` when allocating large memory blocks during parsing of ABC (ActionScript Bytecode) data.
*   **Memory leaks:** Found in `parseSWF_ENABLEDEBUGGER2`, `parseSWF_PLACEOBJECT3`, `parseSWF_INITACTION`, `parseSWF_MORPHFILLSTYLES`. Memory allocated for strings or other data is not properly deallocated.
*   **Invalid memory access:** Segmentation faults (SEGV) in `decompileRETURN`, `decompileCALLMETHOD`, `decompileGETPROPERTY`, `decompileGETMEMBER`, `decompileIMPLEMENTS`, `decompileDUPLICATECLIP` due to reading from the zero page.
*   **Allocation size too big:**  `parseSWF_DEFINEBINARYDATA` attempts to allocate an excessively large memory block.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Memory exhaustion:**  Out-of-memory errors can lead to denial of service.
*   **Memory leaks:**  Gradual consumption of memory, potentially leading to application instability or denial of service.
*   **Segmentation faults:**  Indicate crashes due to invalid memory access.
*   **Improper memory management:** The core issue underlying many of the vulnerabilities.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Caused by memory exhaustion or crashes.
*   **Application instability:** Memory leaks can lead to unpredictable behavior.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Malicious SWF files:**  Crafted SWF files containing specific ABC bytecode or data structures can trigger the vulnerabilities.
*   **Fuzzing:** The PoCs suggest fuzzing can be used to discover these issues.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Ability to create or obtain malicious SWF files:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a vulnerable SWF file to the target application.
*   **No special privileges required:** Exploitation appears to be triggered by processing the SWF file itself.

**Mitigation or fix:**

The content does not provide specific fixes, but the identified vulnerabilities suggest the following mitigation strategies:

*   **Memory allocation limits:** Implement limits on the maximum amount of memory that can be allocated.
*   **Robust error handling:**  Handle memory allocation failures gracefully.
*   **Memory leak fixes:**  Review and correct memory management in the identified functions (`parseSWF_ENABLEDEBUGGER2`, etc.).
*   **Address memory access issues:** Investigate and fix the causes of the segmentation faults in the decompilation functions.
*   **Input validation:** Validate the size and content of SWF files to prevent excessively large allocations.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The content provides significantly more detail than a typical CVE description would. It includes ASAN (AddressSanitizer) reports and links to PoCs (Proof of Concepts).
*   There are 15 identified vulnerabilities in this report.
*   The PoCs are available at: <https://github.com/goodmow/PoC>
