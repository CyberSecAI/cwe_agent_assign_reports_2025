  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved crypto ecdsa - Harden against **integer overflows in DIV_ROUND_UP()** Herbert notes that DIV_ROUND_UP() may overflow unnecessarily if an ecdsa implementations ->key_size() callback returns an unusually large value. Herbert instead suggests (for a division by 8) X / 8 + !!(X & 7) Based on this formula, introduce a generic DIV_ROUND_UP_POW2() macro and use it in lieu of DIV_ROUND_UP() for ->key_size() return values. Additionally, use the macro in ecc_digits_from_bytes(), whose nbytes parameter is a ->key_size() return value in some instances, or a user-specified ASN.1 length in the case of ecdsa_get_signature_rs().",

If this overflow occurs, it can lead to an **incorrect calculation of buffer size** (CWE-131). This incorrect buffer size calculation could potentially result in a buffer overflow (related to CWE-119) if the undersized buffer is subsequently used in memory operations.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description, which highlights **integer overflows in DIV_ROUND_UP()**. The retriever results also strongly suggest CWE-190 as a primary candidate.\n\nThe evidence from the vulnerability description includes: \"Harden against **integer overflows in DIV_ROUND_UP()**\".\n\nCWE-190 is selected as the primary CWE because it directly addresses the root cause mentioned in the vulnerability description. CWE-131 is considered a secondary CWE because an **incorrect calculation of buffer size** is a potential consequence of the integer overflow. The selection of CWE-190 is at the appropriate level of specificity (Base) as it accurately represents the weakness.\n\nCWEs considered but not used:\n\n*   CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input): While related to input validation, the core issue is the integer overflow during the calculation, not the lack of validation.\n*   CWE-191 (Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)): The description specifically mentions overflows, not underflows.\n*   CWE-193 (Off-by-one Error): This is less precise than CWE-190 as it doesn't directly address the integer overflow issue.\n*   CWE-789 (Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value): While a potential consequence, the root cause is the integer overflow itself.\n*   CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read): This is a potential consequence of a buffer overflow, but the root cause is the integer overflow leading to incorrect size calculations.\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-197: Numeric Truncation Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTruncation errors occur when a primitive is cast to a primitive of a smaller size and data is lost in the conversion.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nWhen converting from one data type to another, such as long to integer, data can be omitted or translated in a way that produces unexpected values.
