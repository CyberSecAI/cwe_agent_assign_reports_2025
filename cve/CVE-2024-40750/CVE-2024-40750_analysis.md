# Analysis for CVE-2024-40750

# Summary

| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-319 | Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-522 | Insufficiently Protected Credentials | 0.7 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary Candidate |
| CWE-312 | Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis

The primary relationship influencing the decision is the parent-child relationship between CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials) and CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information). CWE-319 is a more specific case of CWE-522, making it a better fit as the primary CWE. CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information) was considered as an alternative or additional CWE, but the focus of the vulnerability is on the transmission rather than the storage of the password.

## Vulnerability Chain

The vulnerability chain starts with the **insecure transmission of Wi-Fi passwords in cleartext** (CWE-319). This leads to the exposure of sensitive information, which could then be used by attackers to gain unauthorized access to Wi-Fi networks. The chain is as follows:
1.  **Cleartext Transmission (CWE-319):** The router sends Wi-Fi credentials without encryption.
2.  **Compromised Credentials (CWE-522):** Due to the cleartext transmission, credentials become vulnerable.
3.  **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers intercept the credentials and gain network access (impact).

## Summary of Analysis

The analysis strongly supports the classification of this vulnerability as CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information). The vulnerability description explicitly states that the Linksys Velop Pro 6E devices send cleartext Wi-Fi passwords over the public Internet. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this by stating that the root cause of the vulnerability is the transmission of Wi-Fi login details in plaintext to Amazon AWS servers.

While CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials) is also relevant, it is a broader category. Since the vulnerability is specifically about cleartext transmission, CWE-319 is the more accurate and specific choice. CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information) was considered but is less relevant as the primary issue is with transmission, not storage.

The decision is based on direct evidence from the vulnerability description and the CVE reference summary. The relationship analysis highlights that CWE-319 is a child of CWE-522, making it the more precise classification.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-290: Authentication Bypass by Spoofing
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
This attack-focused weakness is caused by incorrectly implemented authentication schemes that are subject to spoofing attacks.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
