  "description": "The Restaurant Menu - Food Ordering System - Table Reservation plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugins shortcode(s) in all versions up to, and including, 2.4.0 due to **insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",

  "reference_content": "- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes within the plugin's shortcodes.\n- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.\n- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages. These scripts will execute whenever a user accesses the affected page. This can lead to various malicious activities, such as redirecting users to malicious sites, stealing cookies, or performing actions on behalf of the user.\n- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation occurs through the plugin's shortcodes. An attacker injects malicious code as an attribute value of the shortcode.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with contributor-level permissions or higher. This allows them to create or edit posts/pages and add the malicious shortcode with injected scripts.",

While several other CWEs were considered, CWE-79 directly addresses the **insufficient input sanitization and output escaping** leading to stored XSS. The base level of abstraction is appropriate as it provides a specific description of the vulnerability's root cause.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe116[\"CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n\n    cwe79 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe116 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe79 primary\n    class cwe116,cwe74 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **insufficient input sanitization and output escaping** of user-supplied attributes. This leads directly to the ability to inject arbitrary web scripts, resulting in a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The chain is:\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping**\n2.  **Weakness:** CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n3.  **Impact:** Arbitrary web script execution\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on clear evidence within the vulnerability description and CVE reference. The root cause is explicitly stated as **insufficient input sanitization and output escaping**, which aligns perfectly with CWE-79. The attacker's ability to inject arbitrary web scripts confirms the XSS vulnerability.\n\nThe selection of CWE-79 is at the optimal level of specificity because it precisely describes the **improper neutralization of input during web page generation**, which is the core issue. Higher-level CWEs like CWE-74, while related, are less specific and do not capture the web-specific nature of the vulnerability.\n\nThe evidence supporting this decision includes:\n\n*   \"**insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes**\"\n*   \"authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts\"\n*   \"Stored Cross-Site Scripting\"\n*   \"Root cause of vulnerability: Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes within the plugin's shortcodes.\"\n*   \"Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.\"\n*   \"Impact of exploitation: An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages.\"\n\n**Other CWEs Considered:**\n\n*   **CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output:** This CWE was considered because the description mentions output escaping. However, CWE-79 is a more specific match as it directly addresses XSS, which is the vulnerability in question.\n*   **CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization:** This CWE was considered because the attacker needs to be an authenticated user. However, the core issue is not with authorization, but with the **improper handling of user input**, making CWE-79 a more appropriate choice.\n*   **CWE-96: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Statically Saved Code ('Static Code Injection'):** This was considered because the vulnerability involves stored XSS. However, CWE-79 more accurately describes the root cause, which is the **lack of proper input sanitization** leading to the XSS vulnerability.",
