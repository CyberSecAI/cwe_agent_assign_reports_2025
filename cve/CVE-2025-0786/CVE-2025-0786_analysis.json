Specifically, the vulnerability involves the manipulation of the `flowId` argument leading to **SQL Injection**, which aligns directly with CWE-89's description of constructing SQL commands using externally-influenced input without proper neutralization. No parent-child, chain, or peer relationships were necessary to consider in this case, as the description directly and accurately fits CWE-89.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe89 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **SQL Injection** vulnerability due to improper neutralization of the `flowId` argument.\n2.  **Impact:** Remote attacker can manipulate SQL commands.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, specifically the vulnerability description stating that manipulation of the `flowId` argument leads to **SQL Injection**.
