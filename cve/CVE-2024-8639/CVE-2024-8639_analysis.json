  "description": "Use after free in Autofill in Google Chrome on Android prior to 128.0.6613.137 allowed a remote attacker to potentially exploit heap corruption via a crafted HTML page. (Chromium security severity High)",
  "key_phrases": {
    "rootcause": "use after free",
    "weakness": "",
    "impact": "potentially exploit heap corruption",
    "vector": "crafted HTML page",
    "attacker": "remote attacker",

    "version": "prior to 128.0.6613.137",
    "component": "Autofill"
  },
  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n* **Root Cause:** Use-after-free vulnerability.\n* **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** A memory location is accessed after it has been freed, leading to a use-after-free condition.\n* **Impact of Exploitation:**  The vulnerability is marked as \"High\" severity, indicating that a successful exploit could lead to significant consequences, such as arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or data corruption. The specific impact may depend on the exact context where the use-after-free occurs.\n* **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability is located in the Autofill component of Chrome. The specifics of how an attacker would trigger this vulnerability are not described in the provided content.\n* **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**  The attacker would likely need to interact with the autofill functionality in a specific way to trigger the use-after-free condition. The exact position or level of access is not explicitly mentioned in the content.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n* The vulnerability was reported by \"lime(@limeSec\\_) from TIANGONG Team of Legendsec at QI-ANXIN Group\" on 2024-08-28.\n* The vulnerability is addressed in Chrome version 128.0.6613.137/.138.\n* Access to detailed bug information is restricted until a majority of users have updated to the patched version.",

There are several related CWEs that could potentially follow a use-after-free, such as CWE-754 (Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions), CWE-364 (Signal Handler Race Condition), and CWE-362 (Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')).
