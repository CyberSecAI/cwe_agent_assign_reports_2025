CWE-259 is a more specific Variant of CWE-798, representing the specific case of hardcoded passwords. CWE-1392 represents the use of default credentials, and while hardcoded, the description doesn't indicate they are default.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    cwe259[\"CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password\"]\n    cwe1392[\"CWE-1392: Use of Default Credentials\"]\n    \n    cwe259 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n    cwe1392 -->|PEEROF| cwe798\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe798 primary\n    class cwe259 secondary\n    class cwe1392 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **hardcoded credentials** (CWE-798), which allows an attacker to log in remotely to the Telnet service and perform arbitrary commands.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that the Telnet service contains **hardcoded credentials**, which allows attackers to log in remotely and execute arbitrary commands. This directly aligns with CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials). The evidence is strong, as the description explicitly mentions the **hardcoded credentials** and the associated impact.\n\nCWE-798 is chosen as the primary CWE because it accurately represents the root cause of the vulnerability. The \"Retriever Results\" also list CWE-798 as a highly relevant CWE. The evidence includes the Vulnerability Description mentioning **hardcoded credentials** and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirming the same.\n\nCWE-259 (Use of Hard-coded Password) is considered a secondary candidate because it is a more specific variant of CWE-798. However, since the description doesn't explicitly state whether the **hardcoded credentials** are passwords or cryptographic keys, CWE-798 is a more appropriate primary choice. If it was only a password, then CWE-259 would be the Primary CWE.\n\nCWE-1392 (Use of Default Credentials) was considered because **hardcoded credentials** are often default credentials. However, the description does not indicate that the **hardcoded credentials** are default, so it's not the best fit.\n\nCWE-78 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')) was considered due to the ability to perform arbitrary commands. However, the root cause is the **hardcoded credentials**, not a command injection vulnerability. Therefore, CWE-78 is not an appropriate mapping.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n##
