## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ep93xx clock Fix **off by one** in ep93xx_div_recalc_rate() The psc->div[] array has psc->num_div elements. These values come from when we call clk_hw_register_div(). Its adc_divisors and ARRAY_SIZE(adc_divisors)) and so on. So this condition needs to be >= instead of > to prevent an out of bounds read.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **off by one**
- **impact:** out of bounds read
- **product:** Linux kernel
- **component:** ep93xx_div_recalc_rate()

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE Description:**
The provided content refers to commit `c7f06284a6427475e3df742215535ec3f6cd9662` which is a fix for an out-of-bounds read in the `ep93xx_div_recalc_rate` function in the Linux kernel.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `ep93xx_div_recalc_rate` function uses an index to access the `psc->div[]` array.
- The check `if (index > psc->num_div)` was incorrect and should have been `if (index >= psc->num_div)`.
- This off-by-one error could lead to reading past the end of the array.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds read vulnerability

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The primary impact is an out-of-bounds read, which could lead to unpredictable behavior such as a system crash or potentially information leakage.

**Attack vectors:**
- By controlling the value of `val` (which determines `index`), an attacker could potentially trigger the out-of-bounds read.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need to control or manipulate the clock configuration registers which affect the value of the `index`.
- This would likely require some level of privilege to access and manipulate clock related hardware.

**Additional Notes**
The provided content also includes the commits that backported this fix to various stable branches of the linux kernel.
The fix was backported to the following commits:
