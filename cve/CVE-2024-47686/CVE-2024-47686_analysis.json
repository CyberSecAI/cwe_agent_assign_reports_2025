These values come from when we call clk_hw_register_div(). Its adc_divisors and ARRAY_SIZE(adc_divisors)) and so on. So this condition needs to be >= instead of > to prevent an out of bounds read.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**CVE Description:**\nThe provided content refers to commit `c7f06284a6427475e3df742215535ec3f6cd9662` which is a fix for an out-of-bounds read in the `ep93xx_div_recalc_rate` function in the Linux kernel.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n- The `ep93xx_div_recalc_rate` function uses an index to access the `psc->div[]` array.\n- The check `if (index > psc->num_div)` was incorrect and should have been `if (index >= psc->num_div)`.\n- This off-by-one error could lead to reading past the end of the array.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- Out-of-bounds read vulnerability\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- The primary impact is an out-of-bounds read, which could lead to unpredictable behavior such as a system crash or potentially information leakage.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- By controlling the value of `val` (which determines `index`), an attacker could potentially trigger the out-of-bounds read.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- The attacker would need to control or manipulate the clock configuration registers which affect the value of the `index`.\n- This would likely require some level of privilege to access and manipulate clock related hardware.\n\n**Additional Notes**\nThe provided content also includes the commits that backported this fix to various stable branches of the linux kernel.\nThe fix was backported to the following commits:\n- `27f493e141823db052586010c1532b70b164507c`\n- `66e78ade976dbd9bea09166aa8d66afc0963cde4`\n- `7a5bd2fb92388c51d267f6ce57c40f1cca8af1e0`\n- `ae59eaf36a1ad396e9f657ec9b8b52da6206ed5f`\n\nThis information provides more detail than the standard CVE description, explaining the root cause, impact, and how the vulnerability can be triggered.",
