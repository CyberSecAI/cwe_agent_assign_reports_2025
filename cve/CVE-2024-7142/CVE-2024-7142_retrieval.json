This issue impacts: PAN-OS 8.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 8.1.18; PAN-OS 9.0 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.0.12; PAN-OS 9.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.1.4; PAN-OS 10.0 versions earlier than PAN-OS 10.0.1.\n\n- CVE-2021-3036: An information exposure through log file vulnerability exists in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software where secrets in PAN-OS XML API requests are logged in cleartext to the web server logs when the API is used incorrectly. This vulnerability applies only to PAN-OS appliances that are configured to use the PAN-OS XML API and exists only when a client includes a duplicate API parameter in API requests. Logged information includes the cleartext username, password, and API key of the administrator making the PAN-OS XML API request.\n\n- CVE-2021-3037: An information exposure through log file vulnerability exists in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software where the connection details for a scheduled configuration export are logged in system logs. Logged information includes the cleartext username, password, and IP address used to export the PAN-OS configuration to the destination server.\n\n- CVE-2021-32801: Nextcloud server is an open source, self hosted personal cloud. In affected versions logging of exceptions may have resulted in logging potentially sensitive key material for the Nextcloud Encryption-at-Rest functionality. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server is upgraded to 20.0.12, 21.0.4 or 22.1.0. If upgrading is not an option users are advised to disable system logging to resolve this issue until such time that an upgrade can be performed Note that ff you do not use the Encryption-at-Rest functionality of Nextcloud you are not affected by this bug.\n\n- CVE-2021-3425: A flaw was found in the AMQ Broker that discloses JDBC encrypted usernames and passwords when provided in the AMQ Broker application logfile when using the jdbc persistence functionality.

However, these secrets appear in the Impala logs, therefore Impala users with access to the logs can use another authenticated user's sessions with specially constructed requests. This means the attacker is able to execute statements for which they don't have the necessary privileges otherwise. Impala deployments with Apache Sentry or Apache Ranger authorization enabled may be vulnerable to privilege escalation if an authenticated attacker is able to hijack a session or query from another authenticated user with privileges not assigned to the attacker. Impala deployments with audit logging enabled may be vulnerable to incorrect audit logging as a user could undertake actions that were logged under the name of a different authenticated user. Constructing an attack requires a high degree of technical sophistication and access to the Impala system as an authenticated user. Mitigation: If an Impala deployment uses Apache Sentry, Apache Ranger or audit logging, then users should upgrade to a version of Impala with the fix for IMPALA-10600. The Impala 4.0 release includes this fix. This hides session secrets from the logs to eliminate the risk of any attack using this mechanism. In lieu of an upgrade, restricting access to logs that expose secrets will reduce the risk of an attack. Restricting access to the Impala deployment to trusted users will also reduce the risk of an attack. Log redaction techniques can be used to redact secrets from the logs.\n\n- CVE-2021-3528: A flaw was found in noobaa-operator in versions before 5.7.0, where internal RPC AuthTokens between the noobaa operator and the noobaa core are leaked into log files.

Rosco prior to versions 1.29.2, 1.28.4, and 1.27.3 does not property mask secrets generated via packer builds. This can lead to exposure of sensitive AWS credentials in packer log files. Versions 1.29.2, 1.28.4, and 1.27.3 of Rosco contain fixes for this issue. A workaround is available. It's recommended to use short lived credentials via role assumption and IAM profiles. Additionally, credentials can be set in `/home/spinnaker/.aws/credentials` and `/home/spinnaker/.aws/config` as a volume mount for Rosco pods vs. setting credentials in roscos bake config properties. Last even with those it's recommend to use IAM Roles vs. long lived credentials. This drastically mitigates the risk of credentials exposure. If users have used static credentials, it's recommended to purge any bake logs for AWS, evaluate whether AWS_ACCESS_KEY, SECRET_KEY and/or other sensitive data has been introduced in log files and bake job logs. Then, rotate these credentials and evaluate potential improper use of those credentials.\n\n- CVE-2021-3684: A vulnerability was found in OpenShift Assisted Installer. During generation of the Discovery ISO, image pull secrets were leaked as plaintext in the installation logs. An authenticated user could exploit this by re-using the image pull secret to pull container images from the registry as the associated user.\n\n- CVE-2022-0021: An information exposure through log file vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app on Windows that logs the cleartext credentials of the connecting GlobalProtect user when authenticating using Connect Before Logon feature.

Cisco ADSM must be deployed in a shared workstation environment for this issue to be exploited. This vulnerability is due to the storage of unencrypted credentials in certain logs. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing the logs on an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view the credentials of other users of the shared device.\n\n- CVE-2022-31098: Weave GitOps is a simple open source developer platform for people who want cloud native applications, without needing Kubernetes expertise. A vulnerability in the logging of Weave GitOps could allow an authenticated remote attacker to view sensitive cluster configurations, aka KubeConfg, of registered Kubernetes clusters, including the service account tokens in plain text from Weave GitOps's pod logs on the management cluster. An unauthorized remote attacker can also view these sensitive configurations from external log storage if enabled by the management cluster. This vulnerability is due to the client factory dumping cluster configurations and their service account tokens when the cluster manager tries to connect to an API server of a registered cluster, and a connection error occurs. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by either accessing logs of a pod of Weave GitOps, or from external log storage and obtaining all cluster configurations of registered clusters. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to use those cluster configurations to manage the registered Kubernetes clusters. This vulnerability has been fixed by commit 567356f471353fb5c676c77f5abc2a04631d50ca. Users should upgrade to Weave GitOps core version v0.8.1-rc.6 or newer.

In Keti a user able to create Policy Sets can run arbitrary code by sending malicious Groovy scripts which will escape the configured Groovy sandbox. This vulnerability is known to exist in the latest commit at the time of writing this CVE (commit a1c8dbe). For more details see the referenced GHSL-2021-063.\n\n- CVE-2021-44228: Apache Log4j2 2.0-beta9 through 2.15.0 (excluding security releases 2.12.2, 2.12.3, and 2.3.1) JNDI features used in configuration, log messages, and parameters do not protect against attacker controlled LDAP and other JNDI related endpoints. An attacker who can control log messages or log message parameters can execute arbitrary code loaded from LDAP servers when message lookup substitution is enabled. From log4j 2.15.0, this behavior has been disabled by default. From version 2.16.0 (along with 2.12.2, 2.12.3, and 2.3.1), this functionality has been completely removed. Note that this vulnerability is specific to log4j-core and does not affect log4net, log4cxx, or other Apache Logging Services projects.\n\n- CVE-2020-10199: Sonatype Nexus Repository before 3.21.2 allows JavaEL Injection (issue 1 of 2).\n\n- CVE-2020-17530: Forced OGNL evaluation, when evaluated on raw user input in tag attributes, may lead to remote code execution. Affected software : Apache Struts 2.0.0 - Struts 2.5.25.\n\n- CVE-2022-24818: GeoTools is an open source Java library that provides tools for geospatial data. The GeoTools library has a number of data sources that can perform unchecked JNDI lookups, which in turn can be used to perform class deserialization and result in arbitrary code execution. Similar to the Log4J case, the vulnerability can be triggered if the JNDI names are user-provided, but requires admin-level login to be triggered. The lookups are now restricted in GeoTools 26.4, GeoTools 25.6, and GeoTools 24.6. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that any downstream application should not allow usage of remotely provided JNDI strings.\n\n- CVE-2022-24847: GeoServer is an open source software server written in Java that allows users to share and edit geospatial data. The GeoServer security mechanism can perform an unchecked JNDI lookup, which in turn can be used to perform class deserialization and result in arbitrary code execution. The same can happen while configuring data stores with data sources located in JNDI, or while setting up the disk quota mechanism. In order to perform any of the above changes, the attack needs to have obtained admin rights and use either the GeoServer GUI, or its REST API. The lookups are going to be restricted in GeoServer 2.21.0, 2.20.4, 1.19.6. Users unable to upgrade should restrict access to the `geoserver/web` and `geoserver/rest` via a firewall and ensure that the GeoWebCache is not remotely accessible.\n\n- CVE-2022-26134: In affected versions of Confluence Server and Data Center, an OGNL injection vulnerability exists that would allow an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on a Confluence Server or Data Center instance. The affected versions are from 1.3.0 before 7.4.17, from 7.13.0 before 7.13.7, from 7.14.0 before 7.14.3, from 7.15.0 before 7.15.2, from 7.16.0 before 7.16.4, from 7.17.0 before 7.17.4, and from 7.18.0 before 7.18.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-22947: In spring cloud gateway versions prior to 3.1.1+ and 3.0.7+ , applications are vulnerable to a code injection attack when the Gateway Actuator endpoint is enabled, exposed and unsecured.

In versions prior to 1.9.0, the default configuration of client side sessions results in unencrypted, but signed, data being set as cookie values. This means that if something sensitive goes into the session, it could be read by something with access to the cookies. For this to be a vulnerability, some kind of sensitive data would need to be stored in the session and the session cookie would have to leak. For example, the cookies are not configured with httpOnly and an adjacent XSS vulnerability within the site allowed capture of the cookies. As of version 1.9.0, a securely randomly generated signing key is used. As a workaround, one may supply an encryption key, as per the documentation recommendation.\n\n- CVE-2021-31855: KDE Messagelib through 5.17.0 reveals cleartext of encrypted messages in some situations.

This is fixed in 2022.3.3.\n\n- CVE-2022-41933: XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. When the `reset a forgotten password` feature of XWiki was used, the password was then stored in plain text in database. This only concerns XWiki 13.1RC1 and newer versions. Note that it only concerns the reset password feature available from the \"Forgot your password\" link in the login view: the features allowing a user to change their password, or for an admin to change a user password are not impacted. This vulnerability is particularly dangerous in combination with other vulnerabilities allowing to perform data leak of personal data from users, such as GHSA-599v-w48h-rjrm. Note that this vulnerability only concerns the users of the main wiki: in case of farms, the users registered on subwiki are not impacted thanks to a bug we discovered when investigating this. The problem has been patched in version 14.6RC1, 14.4.3 and 13.10.8. The patch involves a migration of the impacted users as well as the history of the page, to ensure no password remains in plain text in the database. This migration also involves to inform the users about the possible disclosure of their passwords: by default, two emails are automatically sent to the impacted users. A first email to inform about the possibility that their password have been leaked, and a second email using the reset password feature to ask them to set a new password. It's also possible for administrators to set some properties for the migration: it's possible to decide if the user password should be reset (default) or if the passwords should be kept but only hashed. Note that in the first option, the users won't be able to login anymore until they set a new password if they were impacted. Note that in both options, mails will be sent to users to inform them and encourage them to change their passwords.\n\n- CVE-2022-4312:  A cleartext storage of sensitive information vulnerability exists in PcVue versions 8.10 through 15.2.3. This could allow an unauthorized user with access the email and short messaging service (SMS) accounts configuration files to discover the associated simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP) account credentials and the SIM card PIN code. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an unauthorized user access to the underlying email account and SIM card. \n\n- CVE-2022-1794: The CODESYS OPC DA Server prior V3.5.18.20 stores PLC passwords as plain text in its configuration file so that it is visible to all authorized Microsoft Windows users of the system.\n\n- CVE-2022-22458:  IBM Security Verify Governance, Identity Manager 10.0.1 stores user credentials in plain clear text which can be read by a remote authenticated user.

Insecure cryptography can be exploited to expose sensitive information, modify data in unexpected ways, spoof identities of other users or devices, or other impacts.\n\n\nIt is very difficult to produce a secure algorithm, and even high-profile algorithms by accomplished cryptographic experts have been broken. Well-known techniques exist to break or weaken various kinds of cryptography. Accordingly, there are a small number of well-understood and heavily studied algorithms that should be used by most products. Using a non-standard or known-insecure algorithm is dangerous because a determined adversary may be able to break the algorithm and compromise whatever data has been protected.\n\n\nSince the state of cryptography advances so rapidly, it is common for an algorithm to be considered \"unsafe\" even if it was once thought to be strong. This can happen when new attacks are discovered, or if computing power increases so much that the cryptographic algorithm no longer provides the amount of protection that was originally thought.\n\n\nFor a number of reasons, this weakness is even more challenging to manage with hardware deployment of cryptographic algorithms as opposed to software implementation. First, if a flaw is discovered with hardware-implemented cryptography, the flaw cannot be fixed in most cases without a recall of the product, because hardware is not easily replaceable like software. Second, because the hardware product is expected to work for years, the adversary's computing power will only increase over time.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-30273: SCADA-based protocol supports a legacy encryption mode that uses Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA) in ECB mode, which leaks patterns in messages and cannot protect integrity\n\n- CVE-2022-30320: Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) uses a protocol with a cryptographically insecure hashing algorithm for passwords.\n\n- CVE-2008-3775: Product uses \"ROT-25\" to obfuscate the password in the registry.\n\n- CVE-2007-4150: product only uses \"XOR\" to obfuscate sensitive data\n\n- CVE-2007-5460: product only uses \"XOR\" and a fixed key to obfuscate sensitive data\n\n- CVE-2005-4860: Product substitutes characters with other characters in a fixed way, and also leaves certain input characters unchanged.\n\n- CVE-2002-2058: Attackers can infer private IP addresses by dividing each octet by the MD5 hash of '20'.\n\n- CVE-2008-3188: Product uses DES when MD5 has been specified in the configuration, resulting in weaker-than-expected password hashes.\n\n- CVE-2005-2946: Default configuration of product uses MD5 instead of stronger algorithms that are available, simplifying forgery of certificates.\n\n- CVE-2007-6013: Product uses the hash of a hash for authentication, allowing attackers to gain privileges if they can obtain the original hash.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-15128: In OctoberCMS before version 1.0.468, encrypted cookie values were not tied to the name of the cookie the value belonged to. This meant that certain classes of attacks that took advantage of other theoretical vulnerabilities in user facing code (nothing exploitable in the core project itself) had a higher chance of succeeding. Specifically, if your usage exposed a way for users to provide unfiltered user input and have it returned to them as an encrypted cookie (ex. storing a user provided search query in a cookie) they could then use the generated cookie in place of other more tightly controlled cookies; or if your usage exposed the plaintext version of an encrypted cookie at any point to the user they could theoretically provide encrypted content from your application back to it as an encrypted cookie and force the framework to decrypt it for them. Issue has been fixed in build 468 (v1.0.468).\n\n- CVE-2020-4965: IBM Jazz Team Server products use weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms that could allow an attacker to decrypt highly sensitive information.

CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n\n- CVE-2021-37588: In Charm 0.43, any two users can collude to achieve the ability to decrypt YCT14 data.\n\n- CVE-2021-43774: A risky-algorithm issue was discovered on Fujifilm DocuCentre-VI C4471 1.8 devices. An attacker that obtained access to the administrative web interface of a printer (e.g., by using the default credentials) can download the address book file, which contains the list of users (domain users, FTP users, etc.) stored on the printer, together with their encrypted passwords. The passwords are protected by a weak cipher, such as ROT13, which requires minimal effort to instantly retrieve the original password, giving the attacker a list of valid domain or FTP usernames and passwords.\n\n- CVE-2021-43989: mySCADA myPRO Versions 8.20.0 and prior stores passwords using MD5, which may allow an attacker to crack the previously retrieved password hashes.\n\n- CVE-2021-45512: Certain NETGEAR devices are affected by weak cryptography. This affects D7000v2 before 1.0.0.62, D8500 before 1.0.3.50, EX3700 before 1.0.0.84, EX3800 before 1.0.0.84, EX6120 before 1.0.0.54, EX6130 before 1.0.0.36, EX7000 before 1.0.1.90, R6250 before 1.0.4.42, R6400v2 before 1.0.4.98, R6700v3 before 1.0.4.98, R6900P before 1.3.2.124, R7000 before 1.0.11.106, R7000P before 1.3.2.124, R7100LG before 1.0.0.56, R7900 before 1.0.4.26, R8000 before 1.0.4.58, R8300 before 1.0.2.134, R8500 before 1.0.2.134, RS400 before 1.5.0.48, WNR3500Lv2 before 1.2.0.62, and XR300 before 1.0.3.50.\n\n- CVE-2021-45696: An issue was discovered in the sha2 crate 0.9.7 before 0.9.8 for Rust. Hashes of long messages may be incorrect when the AVX2-accelerated backend is used.\n\n- CVE-2022-0377: Users of the LearnPress WordPress plugin before 4.1.5 can upload an image as a profile avatar after the registration. After this process the user crops and saves the image. Then a \"POST\" request that contains user supplied name of the image is sent to the server for renaming and cropping of the image. As a result of this request, the name of the user-supplied image is changed with a MD5 value. This process can be conducted only when type of the image is JPG or PNG. An attacker can use this vulnerability in order to rename an arbitrary image file. By doing this, they could destroy the design of the web site.\n\n- CVE-2022-1252: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm in GitHub repository gnuboard/gnuboard5 prior to and including 5.5.5. A vulnerability in gnuboard v5.5.5 and below uses weak encryption algorithms leading to sensitive information exposure. This allows an attacker to derive the email address of any user, including when the 'Let others see my information.' box is ticked off. Or to send emails to any email address, with full control of its contents \n\n- CVE-2022-1434: The OpenSSL 3.0 implementation of the RC4-MD5 ciphersuite incorrectly uses the AAD data as the MAC key. This makes the MAC key trivially predictable. An attacker could exploit this issue by performing a man-in-the-middle attack to modify data being sent from one endpoint to an OpenSSL 3.0 recipient such that the modified data would still pass the MAC integrity check. Note that data sent from an OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint to a non-OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint will always be rejected by the recipient and the connection will fail at that point. Many application protocols require data to be sent from the client to the server first. Therefore, in such a case, only an OpenSSL 3.0 server would be impacted when talking to a non-OpenSSL 3.0 client. If both endpoints are OpenSSL 3.0 then the attacker could modify data being sent in both directions. In this case both clients and servers could be affected, regardless of the application protocol. Note that in the absence of an attacker this bug means that an OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint communicating with a non-OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint will fail to complete the handshake when using this ciphersuite. The confidentiality of data is not impacted by this issue, i.e. an attacker cannot decrypt data that has been encrypted using this ciphersuite - they can only modify it. In order for this attack to work both endpoints must legitimately negotiate the RC4-MD5 ciphersuite. This ciphersuite is not compiled by default in OpenSSL 3.0, and is not available within the default provider or the default ciphersuite list. This ciphersuite will never be used if TLSv1.3 has been negotiated. In order for an OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint to use this ciphersuite the following must have occurred: 1) OpenSSL must have been compiled with the (non-default) compile time option enable-weak-ssl-ciphers 2) OpenSSL must have had the legacy provider explicitly loaded (either through application code or via configuration) 3) The ciphersuite must have been explicitly added to the ciphersuite list 4) The libssl security level must have been set to 0 (default is 1) 5) A version of SSL/TLS below TLSv1.3 must have been negotiated 6) Both endpoints must negotiate the RC4-MD5 ciphersuite in preference to any others that both endpoints have in common Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.3 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1,3.0.2).\n\n- CVE-2022-20805: A vulnerability in the automatic decryption process in Cisco Umbrella Secure Web Gateway (SWG) could allow an authenticated, adjacent attacker to bypass the SSL decryption and content filtering policies on an affected system. This vulnerability is due to how the decryption function uses the TLS Sever Name Indication (SNI) extension of an HTTP request to discover the destination domain and determine if the request needs to be decrypted. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request over TLS from a client to an unknown or controlled URL. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to bypass the decryption process of Cisco Umbrella SWG and allow malicious content to be downloaded to a host on a protected network. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2022-2097: AES OCB mode for 32-bit x86 platforms using the AES-NI assembly optimised implementation will not encrypt the entirety of the data under some circumstances. This could reveal sixteen bytes of data that was preexisting in the memory that wasn't written. In the special case of \"in place\" encryption, sixteen bytes of the plaintext would be revealed. Since OpenSSL does not support OCB based cipher suites for TLS and DTLS, they are both unaffected. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.5 (Affected 3.0.0-3.0.4). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1q (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1p).\n\n- CVE-2022-2781: In affected versions of Octopus Server it was identified that the same encryption process was used for both encrypting session cookies and variables.\n\n- CVE-2022-28164: Brocade SANnav before SANnav 2.2.0 application uses the Blowfish symmetric encryption algorithm for the storage of passwords. This could allow an authenticated attacker to decrypt stored account passwords.\n\n- CVE-2022-28382: An issue was discovered in certain Verbatim drives through 2022-03-31. Due to the use of an insecure encryption AES mode (Electronic Codebook, aka ECB), an attacker may be able to extract information even from encrypted data, for example by observing repeating byte patterns. The firmware of the USB-to-SATA bridge controller INIC-3637EN uses AES-256 with the ECB mode. This operation mode of block ciphers (e.g., AES) always encrypts identical plaintext data, in this case blocks of 16 bytes, to identical ciphertext data. For some data, for instance bitmap images, the lack of the cryptographic property called diffusion, within ECB, can leak sensitive information even in encrypted data. Thus, the use of the ECB operation mode can put the confidentiality of specific information at risk, even in an encrypted form. This affects Keypad Secure USB 3.2 Gen 1 Drive Part Number #49428, Store 'n' Go Secure Portable HDD GD25LK01-3637-C VER4.0, Executive Fingerprint Secure SSD GDMSFE01-INI3637-C VER1.1, and Fingerprint Secure Portable Hard Drive Part Number #53650.\n\n- CVE-2022-29960: Emerson OpenBSI through 2022-04-29 uses weak cryptography. It is an engineering environment for the ControlWave and Bristol Babcock line of RTUs. DES with hardcoded cryptographic keys is used for protection of certain system credentials, engineering files, and sensitive utilities.\n\n- CVE-2022-30320: Saia Burgess Controls (SBC) PCD through 2022-05-06 uses a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm. According to FSCT-2022-0063, there is a Saia Burgess Controls (SBC) PCD S-Bus weak credential hashing scheme issue. The affected components are characterized as: S-Bus (5050/UDP) authentication. The potential impact is: Authentication bypass. The Saia Burgess Controls (SBC) PCD controllers utilize the S-Bus protocol (5050/UDP) for a variety of engineering purposes. It is possible to configure a password in order to restrict access to sensitive engineering functionality. Authentication is done by using the S-Bus 'write byte' message to a specific address and supplying a hashed version of the password. The hashing algorithm used is based on CRC-16 and as such not cryptographically secure. An insecure hashing algorithm is used. An attacker capable of passively observing traffic can intercept the hashed credentials and trivially find collisions allowing for authentication without having to bruteforce a keyspace defined by the actual strength of the password. This allows the attacker access to sensitive engineering functionality such as uploading/downloading control logic and manipulating controller configuration.\n\n- CVE-2022-35513: The Blink1Control2 application <= 2.2.7 uses weak password encryption and an insecure method of storage.\n\n- CVE-2022-38493: Rhonabwy 0.9.99 through 1.1.x before 1.1.7 doesn't check the RSA private key length before RSA-OAEP decryption. This allows attackers to cause a Denial of Service via a crafted JWE (JSON Web Encryption) token.\n\n- CVE-2022-39237: syslabs/sif is the Singularity Image Format (SIF) reference implementation. In versions prior to 2.8.1the `github.com/sylabs/sif/v2/pkg/integrity` package did not verify that the hash algorithm(s) used are cryptographically secure when verifying digital signatures. A patch is available in version >= v2.8.1 of the module. Users are encouraged to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may independently validate that the hash algorithm(s) used for metadata digest(s) and signature hash are cryptographically secure.\n\n- CVE-2022-28166: In Brocade SANnav version before SANN2.2.0.2 and Brocade SANNav before 2.1.1.8, the implementation of TLS/SSL Server Supports the Use of Static Key Ciphers (ssl-static-key-ciphers) on ports 443 & 18082.\n\n- CVE-2022-30187: Azure Storage Library Information Disclosure Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-23839: OpenSSL 1.0.2 supports SSLv2. If a client attempts to negotiate SSLv2 with a server that is configured to support both SSLv2 and more recent SSL and TLS versions then a check is made for a version rollback attack when unpadding an RSA signature. Clients that support SSL or TLS versions greater than SSLv2 are supposed to use a special form of padding. A server that supports greater than SSLv2 is supposed to reject connection attempts from a client where this special form of padding is present, because this indicates that a version rollback has occurred (i.e. both client and server support greater than SSLv2, and yet this is the version that is being requested). The implementation of this padding check inverted the logic so that the connection attempt is accepted if the padding is present, and rejected if it is absent. This means that such as server will accept a connection if a version rollback attack has occurred. Further the server will erroneously reject a connection if a normal SSLv2 connection attempt is made. Only OpenSSL 1.0.2 servers from version 1.0.2s to 1.0.2x are affected by this issue. In order to be vulnerable a 1.0.2 server must: 1) have configured SSLv2 support at compile time (this is off by default), 2) have configured SSLv2 support at runtime (this is off by default), 3) have configured SSLv2 ciphersuites (these are not in the default ciphersuite list) OpenSSL 1.1.1 does not have SSLv2 support and therefore is not vulnerable to this issue. The underlying error is in the implementation of the RSA_padding_check_SSLv23() function. This also affects the RSA_SSLV23_PADDING padding mode used by various other functions. Although 1.1.1 does not support SSLv2 the RSA_padding_check_SSLv23() function still exists, as does the RSA_SSLV23_PADDING padding mode. Applications that directly call that function or use that padding mode will encounter this issue. However since there is no support for the SSLv2 protocol in 1.1.1 this is considered a bug and not a security issue in that version. OpenSSL 1.0.2 is out of support and no longer receiving public updates. Premium support customers of OpenSSL 1.0.2 should upgrade to 1.0.2y. Other users should upgrade to 1.1.1j. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2y (Affected 1.0.2s-1.0.2x).\n\n- CVE-2021-20379: IBM Guardium Data Encryption (GDE) 3.0.0.3 and 4.0.0.4 uses weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms that could allow an attacker to decrypt highly sensitive information.

NTPsec 1.2.0 allows ntpkeygen to generate keys with '#' characters. ntpd then either pads, shortens the key, or fails to load these keys entirely, depending on the key type and the placement of the '#'. This results in the administrator not being able to use the keys as expected or the keys are shorter than expected and easier to brute-force, possibly resulting in MITM attacks between ntp clients and ntp servers. For short AES128 keys, ntpd generates a warning that it is padding them.\n\n- CVE-2021-22356: There is a weak secure algorithm vulnerability in Huawei products.

Versions 2.2 and earlier for release builds and versions 425 and earlier for nightly builds suffer from use of a weak cryptographic algorithm (RSA/ECB/PKCS1Padding). The issue will be patched in v2.3 for release builds and 426 onwards for nightly builds. As a workaround, one may disable an advance security feature if not required.\n\n- CVE-2021-41278: Functions SDK for EdgeX is meant to provide all the plumbing necessary for developers to get started in processing/transforming/exporting data out of the EdgeX IoT platform. In affected versions broken encryption in app-functions-sdk \u201cAES\u201d transform in EdgeX Foundry releases prior to Jakarta allows attackers to decrypt messages via unspecified vectors. The app-functions-sdk exports an \u201caes\u201d transform that user scripts can optionally call to encrypt data in the processing pipeline. No decrypt function is provided. Encryption is not enabled by default, but if used, the level of protection may be less than the user may expects due to a broken implementation. Version v2.1.0 (EdgeX Foundry Jakarta release and later) of app-functions-sdk-go/v2 deprecates the \u201caes\u201d transform and provides an improved \u201caes256\u201d transform in its place. The broken implementation will remain in a deprecated state until it is removed in the next EdgeX major release to avoid breakage of existing software that depends on the broken implementation. As the broken transform is a library function that is not invoked by default, users who do not use the AES transform in their processing pipelines are unaffected. Those that are affected are urged to upgrade to the Jakarta EdgeX release and modify processing pipelines to use the new \"aes256\" transform.\n\n- CVE-2021-42583: A Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm exists in Max Mazurov Maddy before 0.5.2, which is an unnecessary risk that may result in the exposure of sensitive information.\n\n- CVE-2021-43550: The use of a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm is an unnecessary risk that may result in the exposure of sensitive information, which affects the communications between Patient Information Center iX (PIC iX) Versions C.02 and C.03 and Efficia CM Series Revisions A.01 to C.0x and 4.0.\n\n- CVE-2022-20117: In (TBD) of (TBD), there is a possible way to decrypt local data encrypted by the GSC due to improperly used crypto.

Without use of quotas, resource limits, or other protection mechanisms, it can be easy for an attacker to consume many resources by rapidly making many requests, or causing larger resources to be used than is needed.

This is due to the insufficient management of available filesystem resources. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability through the Virtual Host Monitoring section by requesting random virtual-host historical data and exhausting available filesystem resources. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause database errors and cause the device to become unresponsive to web-based management. (Manual intervention is required to free filesystem resources and return the application to an operational state.)\n\n- CVE-2021-22174: Crash in USB HID dissector in Wireshark 3.4.0 to 3.4.2 allows denial of service via packet injection or crafted capture file\n\n- CVE-2020-22785: Etherpad < 1.8.3 is affected by a missing lock check which could cause a denial of service.

Sydent does not limit the size of requests it receives from HTTP clients. A malicious user could send an HTTP request with a very large body, leading to memory exhaustion and denial of service. Sydent also does not limit response size for requests it makes to remote Matrix homeservers. A malicious homeserver could return a very large response, again leading to memory exhaustion and denial of service. This affects any server which accepts registration requests from untrusted clients. This issue has been patched by releases 89071a1, 0523511, f56eee3. As a workaround request sizes can be limited in an HTTP reverse-proxy. There are no known workarounds for the problem with overlarge responses.\n\n- CVE-2021-29932: An issue was discovered in the parse_duration crate through 2021-03-18 for Rust. It allows attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU and memory consumption) via a duration string with a large exponent.\n\n- CVE-2021-32699: Wings is the control plane software for the open source Pterodactyl game management system. All versions of Pterodactyl Wings prior to `1.4.4` are vulnerable to system resource exhaustion due to improper container process limits being defined. A malicious user can consume more resources than intended and cause downstream impacts to other clients on the same hardware, eventually causing the physical server to stop responding. Users should upgrade to `1.4.4` to mitigate the issue. There is no non-code based workaround for impacted versions of the software. Users running customized versions of this software can manually set a PID limit for containers created.\n\n- CVE-2021-3478: There's a flaw in OpenEXR's scanline input file functionality in versions before 3.0.0-beta. An attacker able to submit a crafted file to be processed by OpenEXR could consume excessive system memory. The greatest impact of this flaw is to system availability.\n\n- CVE-2021-38463: The affected product does not properly control the allocation of resources. A user may be able to allocate unlimited memory buffers using API functions.\n\n- CVE-2021-38465: The webinstaller is a Golang web server executable that enables the generation of an Auvesy image agent. Resource consumption can be achieved by generating large amounts of installations, which are then saved without limitation in the temp folder of the webinstaller executable.\n\n- CVE-2021-3912: OctoRPKI tries to load the entire contents of a repository in memory, and in the case of a GZIP bomb, unzip it in memory, making it possible to create a repository that makes OctoRPKI run out of memory (and thus crash).\n\n- CVE-2021-41546: A vulnerability has been identified in RUGGEDCOM ROX MX5000 (All versions < V2.14.1), RUGGEDCOM ROX RX1400 (All versions < V2.14.1), RUGGEDCOM ROX RX1500 (All versions < V2.14.1), RUGGEDCOM ROX RX1501 (All versions < V2.14.1), RUGGEDCOM ROX RX1510 (All versions < V2.14.1), RUGGEDCOM ROX RX1511 (All versions < V2.14.1), RUGGEDCOM ROX RX1512 (All versions < V2.14.1), RUGGEDCOM ROX RX1524 (All versions < V2.14.1), RUGGEDCOM ROX RX1536 (All versions < V2.14.1), RUGGEDCOM ROX RX5000 (All versions < V2.14.1). Affected devices write crashdumps without checking if enough space is available on the filesystem. Once the crashdump fills the entire root filesystem, affected devices fail to boot successfully. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to cause a permanent Denial-of-Service.\n\n- CVE-2021-21274: Synapse is a Matrix reference homeserver written in python (pypi package matrix-synapse). Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and VoIP. In Synapse before version 1.25.0, a malicious homeserver could redirect requests to their .well-known file to a large file. This can lead to a denial of service attack where homeservers will consume significantly more resources when requesting the .well-known file of a malicious homeserver. This affects any server which accepts federation requests from untrusted servers. Issue is resolved in version 1.25.0. As a workaround the `federation_domain_whitelist` setting can be used to restrict the homeservers communicated with over federation.\n\n- CVE-2021-21294: Http4s (http4s-blaze-server) is a minimal, idiomatic Scala interface for HTTP services. Http4s before versions 0.21.17, 0.22.0-M2, and 1.0.0-M14 have a vulnerability which can lead to a denial-of-service. Blaze-core, a library underlying http4s-blaze-server, accepts connections unboundedly on its selector pool. This has the net effect of amplifying degradation in services that are unable to handle their current request load, since incoming connections are still accepted and added to an unbounded queue. Each connection allocates a socket handle, which drains a scarce OS resource. This can also confound higher level circuit breakers which work based on detecting failed connections. http4s provides a general \"MaxActiveRequests\" middleware mechanism for limiting open connections, but it is enforced inside the Blaze accept loop, after the connection is accepted and the socket opened. Thus, the limit only prevents the number of connections which can be simultaneously processed, not the number of connections which can be held open. In 0.21.17, 0.22.0-M2, and 1.0.0-M14, a new \"maxConnections\" property, with a default value of 1024, has been added to the `BlazeServerBuilder`. Setting the value to a negative number restores unbounded behavior, but is strongly disrecommended. The NIO2 backend does not respect `maxConnections`. Its use is now deprecated in http4s-0.21, and the option is removed altogether starting in http4s-0.22. There are several possible workarounds described in the refrenced GitHub Advisory GHSA-xhv5-w9c5-2r2w.\n\n- CVE-2021-23053: On version 15.1.x before 15.1.3, 14.1.x before 14.1.3.1, and 13.1.x before 13.1.3.6, when the brute force protection feature of BIG-IP Advanced WAF or BIG-IP ASM is enabled on a virtual server and the virtual server is under brute force attack, the MySQL database may run out of disk space due to lack of row limit on undisclosed tables in the MYSQL database.

The ExecSync request runs commands in a container and logs the output of the command. This output is then read by CRI-O after command execution, and it is read in a manner where the entire file corresponding to the output of the command is read in. Thus, if the output of the command is large it is possible to exhaust the memory or the disk space of the node when CRI-O reads the output of the command. The highest threat from this vulnerability is system availability.\n\n- CVE-2022-20143: In addAutomaticZenRule of ZenModeHelper.java, there is a possible permanent denial of service due to resource exhaustion.

Versions older than `v0.38.0` of js-libp2p are vulnerable to targeted resource exhaustion attacks. These attacks target libp2p\u2019s connection, stream, peer, and memory management. An attacker can cause the allocation of large amounts of memory, ultimately leading to the process getting killed by the host\u2019s operating system. While a connection manager tasked with keeping the number of connections within manageable limits has been part of js-libp2p, this component was designed to handle the regular churn of peers, not a targeted resource exhaustion attack. Users are advised to update their js-libp2p dependency to `v0.38.0` or greater. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2022-23492: go-libp2p is the offical libp2p implementation in the Go programming language. Version `0.18.0` and older of go-libp2p are vulnerable to targeted resource exhaustion attacks. These attacks target libp2p\u2019s connection, stream, peer, and memory management. An attacker can cause the allocation of large amounts of memory, ultimately leading to the process getting killed by the host\u2019s operating system. While a connection manager tasked with keeping the number of connections within manageable limits has been part of go-libp2p, this component was designed to handle the regular churn of peers, not a targeted resource exhaustion attack. Users are advised to upgrade their version of go-libp2p to version `0.18.1` or newer. Users unable to upgrade may consult the denial of service (dos) mitigation page for more information on how to incorporate mitigation strategies, monitor your application, and respond to attacks.\n\n- CVE-2022-23913: In Apache ActiveMQ Artemis prior to 2.20.0 or 2.19.1, an attacker could partially disrupt availability (DoS) through uncontrolled resource consumption of memory.\n\n- CVE-2022-2406: The legacy Slack import feature in Mattermost version 6.7.0 and earlier fails to properly limit the sizes of imported files, which allows an authenticated attacker to crash the server by importing large files via the Slack import REST API.\n\n- CVE-2022-28871: A Denial-of-Service (DoS) vulnerability was discovered in F-Secure Atlant whereby the fsicapd component used in certain F-Secure products while scanning larger packages/fuzzed files consume too much memory eventually can crash the scanning engine. The exploit can be triggered remotely by an attacker.\n\n- CVE-2022-31075: KubeEdge is an open source system for extending native containerized application orchestration capabilities to hosts at Edge. Prior to versions 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4, EdgeCore may be susceptible to a DoS attack on CloudHub if an attacker was to send a well-crafted HTTP request to `/edge.crt`. If an attacker can send a well-crafted HTTP request to CloudHub, and that request has a very large body, that request can crash the HTTP service through a memory exhaustion vector. The request body is being read into memory, and a body that is larger than the available memory can lead to a successful attack. Because the request would have to make it through authorization, only authorized users may perform this attack. The consequence of the exhaustion is that CloudHub will be in denial of service. KubeEdge is affected only when users enable the CloudHub module in the file `cloudcore.yaml`. This bug has been fixed in Kubeedge 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4. As a workaround, disable the CloudHub switch in the config file `cloudcore.yaml`.\n\n- CVE-2022-31078: KubeEdge is an open source system for extending native containerized application orchestration capabilities to hosts at Edge. Prior to versions 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4, the CloudCore Router does not impose a limit on the size of responses to requests made by the REST handler. An attacker could use this weakness to make a request that will return an HTTP response with a large body and cause DoS of CloudCore. In the HTTP Handler API, the rest handler makes a request to a pre-specified handle. The handle will return an HTTP response that is then read into memory. The consequence of the exhaustion is that CloudCore will be in a denial of service. Only an authenticated user of the cloud can make an attack. It will be affected only when users enable `router` module in the config file `cloudcore.yaml`. This bug has been fixed in Kubeedge 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4. As a workaround, disable the router switch in the config file `cloudcore.yaml`.\n\n- CVE-2022-31079: KubeEdge is an open source system for extending native containerized application orchestration capabilities to hosts at Edge. Prior to versions 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4, the Cloud Stream server and the Edge Stream server reads the entire message into memory without imposing a limit on the size of this message. An attacker can exploit this by sending a large message to exhaust memory and cause a DoS. The Cloud Stream server and the Edge Stream server are under DoS attack in this case. The consequence of the exhaustion is that the CloudCore and EdgeCore will be in a denial of service. Only an authenticated user can cause this issue. It will be affected only when users enable `cloudStream` module in the config file `cloudcore.yaml` and enable `edgeStream` module in the config file `edgecore.yaml`. This bug has been fixed in Kubeedge 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4. As a workaround, disable cloudStream module in the config file `cloudcore.yaml` and disable edgeStream module in the config file `edgecore.yaml`.\n\n- CVE-2022-3147: Mattermost version 7.0.x and earlier fails to sufficiently limit the in-memory sizes of concurrently uploaded JPEG images, which allows authenticated users to cause resource exhaustion on specific system configurations, resulting in server-side Denial of Service.\n\n- CVE-2022-33749: XAPI open file limit DoS It is possible for an unauthenticated client on the network to cause XAPI to hit its file-descriptor limit. This causes XAPI to be unable to accept new requests for other (trusted) clients, and blocks XAPI from carrying out any tasks that require the opening of file descriptors.\n\n- CVE-2022-3423: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling in GitHub repository nocodb/nocodb prior to 0.92.0. \n\n- CVE-2022-35915: OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for secure smart contract development. The target contract of an EIP-165 `supportsInterface` query can cause unbounded gas consumption by returning a lot of data, while it is generally assumed that this operation has a bounded cost. The issue has been fixed in v4.7.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-41932: XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. It's possible to make XWiki create many new schemas and fill them with tables just by using a crafted user identifier in the login form. This may lead to degraded database performance. The problem has been patched in XWiki 13.10.8, 14.6RC1 and 14.4.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-2134: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling in GitHub repository inventree/inventree prior to 0.8.0.\n\n- CVE-2022-43686: In Concrete CMS (formerly concrete5) below 8.5.10 and between 9.0.0 and 9.1.2, the authTypeConcreteCookieMap table can be filled up causing a denial of service (high load).\n\n- CVE-2022-41725: A denial of service is possible from excessive resource consumption in net/http and mime/multipart. Multipart form parsing with mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm can consume largely unlimited amounts of memory and disk files. This also affects form parsing in the net/http package with the Request methods FormFile, FormValue, ParseMultipartForm, and PostFormValue. ReadForm takes a maxMemory parameter, and is documented as storing \"up to maxMemory bytes +10MB (reserved for non-file parts) in memory\". File parts which cannot be stored in memory are stored on disk in temporary files. The unconfigurable 10MB reserved for non-file parts is excessively large and can potentially open a denial of service vector on its own. However, ReadForm did not properly account for all memory consumed by a parsed form, such as map entry overhead, part names, and MIME headers, permitting a maliciously crafted form to consume well over 10MB. In addition, ReadForm contained no limit on the number of disk files created, permitting a relatively small request body to create a large number of disk temporary files. With fix, ReadForm now properly accounts for various forms of memory overhead, and should now stay within its documented limit of 10MB + maxMemory bytes of memory consumption. Users should still be aware that this limit is high and may still be hazardous. In addition, ReadForm now creates at most one on-disk temporary file, combining multiple form parts into a single temporary file. The mime/multipart.File interface type's documentation states, \"If stored on disk, the File's underlying concrete type will be an *os.File.\". This is no longer the case when a form contains more than one file part, due to this coalescing of parts into a single file. The previous behavior of using distinct files for each form part may be reenabled with the environment variable GODEBUG=multipartfiles=distinct. Users should be aware that multipart.ReadForm and the http.Request methods that call it do not limit the amount of disk consumed by temporary files. Callers can limit the size of form data with http.MaxBytesReader.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-400 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-665 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-400 (ChildOf)",

However, when these credentials are easily predictable or even fixed (as with default or hard-coded passwords and keys), then the attacker can defeat the mechanism without relying on brute force.\n\n\nCredentials may be weak for different reasons, such as:\n\n\n  - Hard-coded (i.e., static and unchangeable by the administrator)\n\n  - Default (i.e., the same static value across different deployments/installations, but able to be changed by the administrator)\n\n  - Predictable (i.e., generated in a way that produces unique credentials across deployments/installations, but can still be guessed with reasonable efficiency)\n\nEven if a new, unique credential is intended to be generated for each product installation, if the generation is predictable, then that may also simplify guessing attacks.\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- [REF-1374]: Chain: JavaScript-based cryptocurrency library can fall back to the insecure Math.random() function instead of reporting a failure (CWE-392), thus reducing the entropy (CWE-332) and leading to generation of non-unique cryptographic keys for Bitcoin wallets (CWE-1391)\n\n- CVE-2022-30270: Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) uses default credentials for some SSH accounts\n\n- CVE-2022-29965: Distributed Control System (DCS) uses a deterministic algorithm to generate utility passwords\n\n- CVE-2022-30271: Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) uses a hard-coded SSH private key that is likely to be used in typical deployments\n\n- CVE-2021-38759: microcontroller board has default password, allowing admin access\n\n- CVE-2021-41192: data visualization/sharing package uses default secret keys or cookie values if they are not specified in environment variables\n\n- CVE-2020-8994: UART interface for AI speaker uses empty password for root shell\n\n- CVE-2020-27020: password manager does not generate cryptographically strong passwords, allowing prediction of passwords using guessable details such as time of generation\n\n- CVE-2020-8632: password generator for cloud application has small length value, making it easier for brute-force guessing\n\n- CVE-2020-5365: network-attached storage (NAS) system has predictable default passwords for a diagnostics/support account\n\n- CVE-2020-5248: IT asset management app has a default encryption key that is the same across installations\n\n- CVE-2018-3825: cloud cluster management product has a default master encryption key\n\n- CVE-2012-3503: Installation script has a hard-coded secret token value, allowing attackers to bypass authentication\n\n- CVE-2010-2306: Intrusion Detection System (IDS) uses the same static, private SSL keys for multiple devices and installations, allowing decryption of SSL traffic\n\n- CVE-2001-0618: Residential gateway uses the last 5 digits of the 'Network Name' or SSID as the default WEP key, which allows attackers to get the key by sniffing the SSID, which is sent in the clear\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-3875: A vulnerability classified as critical was found in Click Studios Passwordstate and Passwordstate Browser Extension Chrome. This vulnerability affects unknown code of the component API. The manipulation leads to authentication bypass by assumed-immutable data. The attack can be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component. The identifier of this vulnerability is VDB-216244.\n\n- CVE-2021-3979: A key length flaw was found in Red Hat Ceph Storage. An attacker can exploit the fact that the key length is incorrectly passed in an encryption algorithm to create a non random key, which is weaker and can be exploited for loss of confidentiality and integrity on encrypted disks.\n\n- CVE-2021-42949: The component controlla_login function in HotelDruid Hotel Management Software v3.0.3 generates a predictable session token, allowing attackers to bypass authentication via bruteforce attacks.\n\n- CVE-2022-23555: authentik is an open-source Identity Provider focused on flexibility and versatility. Versions prior to 2022.11.4 and 2022.10.4 are vulnerable to Improper Authentication. Token reuse in invitation URLs leads to access control bypass via the use of a different enrollment flow than in the one provided. The vulnerability allows an attacker that knows different invitation flows names (e.g. `enrollment-invitation-test` and `enrollment-invitation-admin`) via either different invite links or via brute forcing to signup via a single invitation url for any valid invite link received (it can even be a url for a third flow as long as it's a valid invite) as the token used in the `Invitations` section of the Admin interface does NOT change when a different `enrollment flow` is selected via the interface and it is NOT bound to the selected flow, so it will be valid for any flow when used. This issue is patched in authentik 2022.11.4,2022.10.4 and 2022.12.0. Only configurations that use invitations and have multiple enrollment flows with invitation stages that grant different permissions are affected. The default configuration is not vulnerable, and neither are configurations with a single enrollment flow. As a workaround, fixed data can be added to invitations which can be checked in the flow to deny requests. Alternatively, an identifier with high entropy (like a UUID) can be used as flow slug, mitigating the attack vector by exponentially decreasing the possibility of discovering other flows.\n\n- CVE-2022-28376: Verizon 5G Home LVSKIHP outside devices through 2022-02-15 allow anyone (knowing the device's serial number) to access a CPE admin website, e.g., at the 10.0.0.1 IP address. The password (for the verizon username) is calculated by concatenating the serial number and the model (i.e., the LVSKIHP string), running the sha256sum program, and extracting the first seven characters concatenated with the last seven characters of that SHA-256 value.\n\n- CVE-2022-34919: The file upload wizard in Zengenti Contensis Classic before 15.2.1.79 does not correctly check that a user has authenticated.

          "matched_text": "CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\n\nType: Base\n\nStatus: Draft\n\nDescription:\n\nTo fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non-standard, unproven, or disallowed/non-compliant cryptographic implementation.\n\nExtended Details:\n\n\n\nCryptographic protocols and systems depend on cryptographic primitives (and associated algorithms) as their basic building blocks. Some common examples of primitives are digital signatures, one-way hash functions, ciphers, and public key cryptography; however, the notion of \"primitive\" can vary depending on point of view. See \"Terminology Notes\" for further explanation of some concepts.\n\n\nCryptographic primitives are defined to accomplish one very specific task in a precisely defined and mathematically reliable fashion. For example, suppose that for a specific cryptographic primitive (such as an encryption routine), the consensus is that the primitive can only be broken after trying out N different inputs (where the larger the value of N, the stronger the cryptography). For an encryption scheme like AES-256, one would expect N to be so large as to be infeasible to execute in a reasonable amount of time.\n\n\nIf a vulnerability is ever found that shows that one can break a cryptographic primitive in significantly less than the expected number of attempts, then that primitive is considered weakened (or sometimes in extreme cases, colloquially it is \"broken\"). As a result, anything using this cryptographic primitive would now be considered insecure or risky. Thus, even breaking or weakening a seemingly small cryptographic primitive has the potential to render the whole system vulnerable, due to its reliance on the primitive. A historical example can be found in TLS when using DES. One would colloquially call DES the cryptographic primitive for transport encryption in this version of TLS. In the past, DES was considered strong, because no weaknesses were found in it; importantly, DES has a key length of 56 bits. Trying N=2^56 keys was considered impractical for most actors. Unfortunately, attacking a system with 56-bit keys is now practical via brute force, which makes defeating DES encryption practical. It is now practical for an adversary to read any information sent under this version of TLS and use this information to attack the system. As a result, it can be claimed that this use of TLS is weak, and that any system depending on TLS with DES could potentially render the entire system vulnerable to attack.\n\n\nCryptographic primitives and associated algorithms are only considered safe after extensive research and review from experienced cryptographers from academia, industry, and government entities looking for any possible flaws. Furthermore, cryptographic primitives and associated algorithms are frequently reevaluated for safety when new mathematical and attack techniques are discovered. As a result and over time, even well-known cryptographic primitives can lose their compliance status with the discovery of novel attacks that might either defeat the algorithm or reduce its robustness significantly.\n\n\nIf ad-hoc cryptographic primitives are implemented, it is almost certain that the implementation will be vulnerable to attacks that are well understood by cryptographers, resulting in the exposure of sensitive information and other consequences.\n\n\nThis weakness is even more difficult to manage for hardware-implemented deployment of cryptographic algorithms. First, because hardware is not patchable as easily as software, any flaw discovered after release and production typically cannot be fixed without a recall of the product. Secondly, the hardware product is often expected to work for years, during which time computation power available to the attacker only increases. Therefore, for hardware implementations of cryptographic primitives, it is absolutely essential that only strong, proven cryptographic primitives are used.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-4778: software uses MD5, which is less safe than the default SHA-256 used by related products\n\n- CVE-2005-2946: Default configuration of product uses MD5 instead of stronger algorithms that are available, simplifying forgery of certificates.\n\n- CVE-2019-3907: identity card uses MD5 hash of a salt and password\n\n- CVE-2021-34687: personal key is transmitted over the network using a substitution cipher\n\n- CVE-2020-14254: product does not disable TLS-RSA cipher suites, allowing decryption of traffic if TLS 2.0 and secure ciphers are not enabled.\n\n- CVE-2019-1543: SSL/TLS library generates 16-byte nonces but reduces them to 12 byte nonces for the ChaCha20-Poly1305 cipher, converting them in a way that violates the cipher's requirements for unique nonces.\n\n- CVE-2017-9267: LDAP interface allows use of weak ciphers\n\n- CVE-2017-7971: SCADA product allows \"use of outdated cipher suites\"\n\n- CVE-2020-6616: Chip implementing Bluetooth uses a low-entropy PRNG instead of a hardware RNG, allowing spoofing.\n\n- CVE-2019-1715: security product has insufficient entropy in the DRBG, allowing collisions and private key discovery\n\n- CVE-2014-4192: Dual_EC_DRBG implementation in RSA toolkit does not correctly handle certain byte requests, simplifying plaintext recovery\n\n- CVE-2007-6755: Recommendation for Dual_EC_DRBG algorithm contains point Q constants that could simplify decryption\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-34687: iDrive RemotePC before 7.6.48 on Windows allows information disclosure. A man in the middle can recover a system's Personal Key when a client attempts to make a LAN connection. The Personal Key is transmitted over the network while only being encrypted via a substitution cipher.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-327 (ChildOf)",

Insecure cryptography can be exploited to expose sensitive information, modify data in unexpected ways, spoof identities of other users or devices, or other impacts.\n\n\nIt is very difficult to produce a secure algorithm, and even high-profile algorithms by accomplished cryptographic experts have been broken. Well-known techniques exist to break or weaken various kinds of cryptography. Accordingly, there are a small number of well-understood and heavily studied algorithms that should be used by most products. Using a non-standard or known-insecure algorithm is dangerous because a determined adversary may be able to break the algorithm and compromise whatever data has been protected.\n\n\nSince the state of cryptography advances so rapidly, it is common for an algorithm to be considered \"unsafe\" even if it was once thought to be strong. This can happen when new attacks are discovered, or if computing power increases so much that the cryptographic algorithm no longer provides the amount of protection that was originally thought.\n\n\nFor a number of reasons, this weakness is even more challenging to manage with hardware deployment of cryptographic algorithms as opposed to software implementation. First, if a flaw is discovered with hardware-implemented cryptography, the flaw cannot be fixed in most cases without a recall of the product, because hardware is not easily replaceable like software. Second, because the hardware product is expected to work for years, the adversary's computing power will only increase over time.\n",

Insecure cryptography can be exploited to expose sensitive information, modify data in unexpected ways, spoof identities of other users or devices, or other impacts.\n\n\nIt is very difficult to produce a secure algorithm, and even high-profile algorithms by accomplished cryptographic experts have been broken. Well-known techniques exist to break or weaken various kinds of cryptography. Accordingly, there are a small number of well-understood and heavily studied algorithms that should be used by most products. Using a non-standard or known-insecure algorithm is dangerous because a determined adversary may be able to break the algorithm and compromise whatever data has been protected.\n\n\nSince the state of cryptography advances so rapidly, it is common for an algorithm to be considered \"unsafe\" even if it was once thought to be strong. This can happen when new attacks are discovered, or if computing power increases so much that the cryptographic algorithm no longer provides the amount of protection that was originally thought.\n\n\nFor a number of reasons, this weakness is even more challenging to manage with hardware deployment of cryptographic algorithms as opposed to software implementation. First, if a flaw is discovered with hardware-implemented cryptography, the flaw cannot be fixed in most cases without a recall of the product, because hardware is not easily replaceable like software. Second, because the hardware product is expected to work for years, the adversary's computing power will only increase over time.\n",

This issue impacts: PAN-OS 8.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 8.1.18; PAN-OS 9.0 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.0.12; PAN-OS 9.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.1.4; PAN-OS 10.0 versions earlier than PAN-OS 10.0.1.\n\n- CVE-2021-3036: An information exposure through log file vulnerability exists in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software where secrets in PAN-OS XML API requests are logged in cleartext to the web server logs when the API is used incorrectly. This vulnerability applies only to PAN-OS appliances that are configured to use the PAN-OS XML API and exists only when a client includes a duplicate API parameter in API requests. Logged information includes the cleartext username, password, and API key of the administrator making the PAN-OS XML API request.\n\n- CVE-2021-3037: An information exposure through log file vulnerability exists in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software where the connection details for a scheduled configuration export are logged in system logs. Logged information includes the cleartext username, password, and IP address used to export the PAN-OS configuration to the destination server.\n\n- CVE-2021-32801: Nextcloud server is an open source, self hosted personal cloud. In affected versions logging of exceptions may have resulted in logging potentially sensitive key material for the Nextcloud Encryption-at-Rest functionality. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server is upgraded to 20.0.12, 21.0.4 or 22.1.0. If upgrading is not an option users are advised to disable system logging to resolve this issue until such time that an upgrade can be performed Note that ff you do not use the Encryption-at-Rest functionality of Nextcloud you are not affected by this bug.\n\n- CVE-2021-3425: A flaw was found in the AMQ Broker that discloses JDBC encrypted usernames and passwords when provided in the AMQ Broker application logfile when using the jdbc persistence functionality. Versions shipped in Red Hat AMQ 7 are vulnerable.\n\n- CVE-2021-3791: An information disclosure vulnerability was reported in some Motorola-branded Binatone Hubble Cameras that could allow an unauthenticated attacker on the same subnet to download an encrypted log file containing sensitive information such as WiFi SSID and password.\n\n- CVE-2021-28131: Impala sessions use a 16 byte secret to verify that the session is not being hijacked by another user. However, these secrets appear in the Impala logs, therefore Impala users with access to the logs can use another authenticated user's sessions with specially constructed requests. This means the attacker is able to execute statements for which they don't have the necessary privileges otherwise. Impala deployments with Apache Sentry or Apache Ranger authorization enabled may be vulnerable to privilege escalation if an authenticated attacker is able to hijack a session or query from another authenticated user with privileges not assigned to the attacker. Impala deployments with audit logging enabled may be vulnerable to incorrect audit logging as a user could undertake actions that were logged under the name of a different authenticated user. Constructing an attack requires a high degree of technical sophistication and access to the Impala system as an authenticated user. Mitigation: If an Impala deployment uses Apache Sentry, Apache Ranger or audit logging, then users should upgrade to a version of Impala with the fix for IMPALA-10600. The Impala 4.0 release includes this fix. This hides session secrets from the logs to eliminate the risk of any attack using this mechanism. In lieu of an upgrade, restricting access to logs that expose secrets will reduce the risk of an attack. Restricting access to the Impala deployment to trusted users will also reduce the risk of an attack. Log redaction techniques can be used to redact secrets from the logs.\n\n- CVE-2021-3528: A flaw was found in noobaa-operator in versions before 5.7.0, where internal RPC AuthTokens between the noobaa operator and the noobaa core are leaked into log files.

A high privileged user could potentially exploit this vulnerability, leading to a complete outage.\n\n- CVE-2022-23506: Spinnaker is an open source, multi-cloud continuous delivery platform for releasing software changes, and Spinnaker's Rosco microservice produces machine images. Rosco prior to versions 1.29.2, 1.28.4, and 1.27.3 does not property mask secrets generated via packer builds. This can lead to exposure of sensitive AWS credentials in packer log files. Versions 1.29.2, 1.28.4, and 1.27.3 of Rosco contain fixes for this issue. A workaround is available. It's recommended to use short lived credentials via role assumption and IAM profiles. Additionally, credentials can be set in `/home/spinnaker/.aws/credentials` and `/home/spinnaker/.aws/config` as a volume mount for Rosco pods vs. setting credentials in roscos bake config properties. Last even with those it's recommend to use IAM Roles vs. long lived credentials. This drastically mitigates the risk of credentials exposure. If users have used static credentials, it's recommended to purge any bake logs for AWS, evaluate whether AWS_ACCESS_KEY, SECRET_KEY and/or other sensitive data has been introduced in log files and bake job logs. Then, rotate these credentials and evaluate potential improper use of those credentials.\n\n- CVE-2021-3684: A vulnerability was found in OpenShift Assisted Installer.

A successful exploit could allow the attacker to retrieve sensitive information that includes user credentials.\n\n- CVE-2022-33737: The OpenVPN Access Server installer creates a log file readable for everyone, which from version 2.10.0 and before 2.11.0 may contain a random generated admin password\n\n- CVE-2022-34826: In Couchbase Server 7.1.x before 7.1.1, an encrypted Private Key passphrase may be leaked in the logs.\n\n- CVE-2022-20458: The logs of sensitive information (PII) or hardware identifier should only be printed in Android \"userdebug\" or \"eng\" build. StatusBarNotification.getKey() could contain sensitive information. However, CarNotificationListener.java, it prints out the StatusBarNotification.getKey() directly in logs, which could contain user's account name (i.e. PII), in Android \"user\" build.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-12LAndroid ID: A-205567776\n\n- CVE-2022-20651: A vulnerability in the logging component of Cisco Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM) could allow an authenticated, local attacker to view sensitive information in clear text on an affected system. Cisco ADSM must be deployed in a shared workstation environment for this issue to be exploited. This vulnerability is due to the storage of unencrypted credentials in certain logs. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing the logs on an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view the credentials of other users of the shared device.\n\n- CVE-2022-31098: Weave GitOps is a simple open source developer platform for people who want cloud native applications, without needing Kubernetes expertise. A vulnerability in the logging of Weave GitOps could allow an authenticated remote attacker to view sensitive cluster configurations, aka KubeConfg, of registered Kubernetes clusters, including the service account tokens in plain text from Weave GitOps's pod logs on the management cluster. An unauthorized remote attacker can also view these sensitive configurations from external log storage if enabled by the management cluster. This vulnerability is due to the client factory dumping cluster configurations and their service account tokens when the cluster manager tries to connect to an API server of a registered cluster, and a connection error occurs. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by either accessing logs of a pod of Weave GitOps, or from external log storage and obtaining all cluster configurations of registered clusters. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to use those cluster configurations to manage the registered Kubernetes clusters. This vulnerability has been fixed by commit 567356f471353fb5c676c77f5abc2a04631d50ca. Users should upgrade to Weave GitOps core version v0.8.1-rc.6 or newer.

In Keti a user able to create Policy Sets can run arbitrary code by sending malicious Groovy scripts which will escape the configured Groovy sandbox. This vulnerability is known to exist in the latest commit at the time of writing this CVE (commit a1c8dbe). For more details see the referenced GHSL-2021-063.\n\n- CVE-2021-44228: Apache Log4j2 2.0-beta9 through 2.15.0 (excluding security releases 2.12.2, 2.12.3, and 2.3.1) JNDI features used in configuration, log messages, and parameters do not protect against attacker controlled LDAP and other JNDI related endpoints. An attacker who can control log messages or log message parameters can execute arbitrary code loaded from LDAP servers when message lookup substitution is enabled. From log4j 2.15.0, this behavior has been disabled by default. From version 2.16.0 (along with 2.12.2, 2.12.3, and 2.3.1), this functionality has been completely removed. Note that this vulnerability is specific to log4j-core and does not affect log4net, log4cxx, or other Apache Logging Services projects.\n\n- CVE-2020-10199: Sonatype Nexus Repository before 3.21.2 allows JavaEL Injection (issue 1 of 2).\n\n- CVE-2020-17530: Forced OGNL evaluation, when evaluated on raw user input in tag attributes, may lead to remote code execution. Affected software : Apache Struts 2.0.0 - Struts 2.5.25.\n\n- CVE-2022-24818: GeoTools is an open source Java library that provides tools for geospatial data. The GeoTools library has a number of data sources that can perform unchecked JNDI lookups, which in turn can be used to perform class deserialization and result in arbitrary code execution. Similar to the Log4J case, the vulnerability can be triggered if the JNDI names are user-provided, but requires admin-level login to be triggered. The lookups are now restricted in GeoTools 26.4, GeoTools 25.6, and GeoTools 24.6. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that any downstream application should not allow usage of remotely provided JNDI strings.\n\n- CVE-2022-24847: GeoServer is an open source software server written in Java that allows users to share and edit geospatial data. The GeoServer security mechanism can perform an unchecked JNDI lookup, which in turn can be used to perform class deserialization and result in arbitrary code execution. The same can happen while configuring data stores with data sources located in JNDI, or while setting up the disk quota mechanism. In order to perform any of the above changes, the attack needs to have obtained admin rights and use either the GeoServer GUI, or its REST API. The lookups are going to be restricted in GeoServer 2.21.0, 2.20.4, 1.19.6. Users unable to upgrade should restrict access to the `geoserver/web` and `geoserver/rest` via a firewall and ensure that the GeoWebCache is not remotely accessible.\n\n- CVE-2022-26134: In affected versions of Confluence Server and Data Center, an OGNL injection vulnerability exists that would allow an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on a Confluence Server or Data Center instance. The affected versions are from 1.3.0 before 7.4.17, from 7.13.0 before 7.13.7, from 7.14.0 before 7.14.3, from 7.15.0 before 7.15.2, from 7.16.0 before 7.16.4, from 7.17.0 before 7.17.4, and from 7.18.0 before 7.18.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-22947: In spring cloud gateway versions prior to 3.1.1+ and 3.0.7+ , applications are vulnerable to a code injection attack when the Gateway Actuator endpoint is enabled, exposed and unsecured.

Even if the information is encoded in a way that is not human-readable, certain techniques could determine which encoding is being used, then decode the information.\n\n\nWhen organizations adopt cloud services, it can be easier for attackers to access the data from anywhere on the Internet.\n\n\nIn some systems/environments such as cloud, the use of \"double encryption\" (at both the software and hardware layer) might be required, and the developer might be solely responsible for both layers, instead of shared responsibility with the administrator of the broader system/environment.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-30275: Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) uses a driver that relies on a password stored in plaintext.\n\n- CVE-2009-2272: password and username stored in cleartext in a cookie\n\n- CVE-2009-1466: password stored in cleartext in a file with insecure permissions\n\n- CVE-2009-0152: chat program disables SSL in some circumstances even when the user says to use SSL.\n\n- CVE-2009-1603: Chain: product uses an incorrect public exponent when generating an RSA key, which effectively disables the encryption\n\n- CVE-2009-0964: storage of unencrypted passwords in a database\n\n- CVE-2008-6157: storage of unencrypted passwords in a database\n\n- CVE-2008-6828: product stores a password in cleartext in memory\n\n- CVE-2008-1567: storage of a secret key in cleartext in a temporary file\n\n- CVE-2008-0174: SCADA product uses HTTP Basic Authentication, which is not encrypted\n\n- CVE-2007-5778: login credentials stored unencrypted in a registry key\n\n- CVE-2001-1481: Plaintext credentials in world-readable file.\n\n- CVE-2005-1828: Password in cleartext in config file.\n\n- CVE-2005-2209: Password in cleartext in config file.\n\n- CVE-2002-1696: Decrypted copy of a message written to disk given a combination of options and when user replies to an encrypted message.\n\n- CVE-2004-2397: Plaintext storage of private key and passphrase in log file when user imports the key.\n\n- CVE-2002-1800: Admin password in plaintext in a cookie.\n\n- CVE-2001-1537: Default configuration has cleartext usernames/passwords in cookie.\n\n- CVE-2001-1536: Usernames/passwords in cleartext in cookies.\n\n- CVE-2005-2160: Authentication information stored in cleartext in a cookie.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-21339: TYPO3 is an open source PHP based web content management system. In TYPO3 before versions 6.2.57, 7.6.51, 8.7.40, 9.5.25, 10.4.14, 11.1.1 user session identifiers were stored in cleartext - without processing of additional cryptographic hashing algorithms. This vulnerability cannot be exploited directly and occurs in combination with a chained attack - like for instance SQL injection in any other component of the system. This is fixed in versions 6.2.57, 7.6.51, 8.7.40, 9.5.25, 10.4.14, 11.1.1.\n\n- CVE-2021-29481: Ratpack is a toolkit for creating web applications. In versions prior to 1.9.0, the default configuration of client side sessions results in unencrypted, but signed, data being set as cookie values. This means that if something sensitive goes into the session, it could be read by something with access to the cookies. For this to be a vulnerability, some kind of sensitive data would need to be stored in the session and the session cookie would have to leak. For example, the cookies are not configured with httpOnly and an adjacent XSS vulnerability within the site allowed capture of the cookies. As of version 1.9.0, a securely randomly generated signing key is used. As a workaround, one may supply an encryption key, as per the documentation recommendation.\n\n- CVE-2021-31855: KDE Messagelib through 5.17.0 reveals cleartext of encrypted messages in some situations. Deleting an attachment of a decrypted encrypted message stored on a remote server (e.g., an IMAP server) causes KMail to upload the decrypted content of the message to the remote server. With a crafted message, a user could be tricked into decrypting an encrypted message and then deleting an attachment attached to this message. If the attacker has access to the messages stored on the email server, then the attacker could read the decrypted content of the encrypted message. This occurs in ViewerPrivate::deleteAttachment in messageviewer/src/viewer/viewer_p.cpp.\n\n- CVE-2021-36165: RICON Industrial Cellular Router S9922L 16.10.3(3794) is affected by cleartext storage of sensitive information and sends username and password as base64.\n\n- CVE-2021-35526: Backup file without encryption vulnerability is found in Hitachi ABB Power Grids System Data Manager \u2013 SDM600 allows attacker to gain access to sensitive information.

            "matched_text": "CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\n\nType: Base\n\nStatus: Incomplete\n\nDescription:\n\nStoring a password in plaintext may result in a system compromise.\n\nExtended Details:\n\nPassword management issues occur when a password is stored in plaintext in an application's properties, configuration file, or memory. Storing a plaintext password in a configuration file allows anyone who can read the file access to the password-protected resource. In some contexts, even storage of a plaintext password in memory is considered a security risk if the password is not cleared immediately after it is used.\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-30275: Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) uses a driver that relies on a password stored in plaintext.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-1126: A vulnerability in the storage of proxy server credentials of Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) could allow an authenticated, local attacker to view credentials for a configured proxy server. The vulnerability is due to clear-text storage and weak permissions of related configuration files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing the CLI of the affected software and viewing the contents of the affected files. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view the credentials that are used to access the proxy server.\n\n- CVE-2021-41023: A unprotected storage of credentials in Fortinet FortiSIEM Windows Agent version 4.1.4 and below allows an authenticated user to disclosure agent password due to plaintext credential storage in log files\n\n- CVE-2021-1589: A vulnerability in the disaster recovery feature of Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to gain unauthorized access to user credentials. This vulnerability exists because access to API endpoints is not properly restricted. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a request to an API endpoint. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access to administrative credentials that could be used in further attacks.\n\n- CVE-2021-41297: ECOA BAS controller is vulnerable to weak access control mechanism allowing authenticated user to remotely escalate privileges by disclosing credentials of administrative accounts in plain-text.\n\n- CVE-2021-21590: Dell EMC Unity, Unity XT, and UnityVSA versions prior to 5.1.0.0.5.394 contain a plain-text password storage vulnerability.

This is fixed in 2022.3.3.\n\n- CVE-2022-41933: XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. When the `reset a forgotten password` feature of XWiki was used, the password was then stored in plain text in database. This only concerns XWiki 13.1RC1 and newer versions. Note that it only concerns the reset password feature available from the \"Forgot your password\" link in the login view: the features allowing a user to change their password, or for an admin to change a user password are not impacted. This vulnerability is particularly dangerous in combination with other vulnerabilities allowing to perform data leak of personal data from users, such as GHSA-599v-w48h-rjrm. Note that this vulnerability only concerns the users of the main wiki: in case of farms, the users registered on subwiki are not impacted thanks to a bug we discovered when investigating this. The problem has been patched in version 14.6RC1, 14.4.3 and 13.10.8. The patch involves a migration of the impacted users as well as the history of the page, to ensure no password remains in plain text in the database. This migration also involves to inform the users about the possible disclosure of their passwords: by default, two emails are automatically sent to the impacted users. A first email to inform about the possibility that their password have been leaked, and a second email using the reset password feature to ask them to set a new password. It's also possible for administrators to set some properties for the migration: it's possible to decide if the user password should be reset (default) or if the passwords should be kept but only hashed. Note that in the first option, the users won't be able to login anymore until they set a new password if they were impacted. Note that in both options, mails will be sent to users to inform them and encourage them to change their passwords.\n\n- CVE-2022-4312:  A cleartext storage of sensitive information vulnerability exists in PcVue versions 8.10 through 15.2.3. This could allow an unauthorized user with access the email and short messaging service (SMS) accounts configuration files to discover the associated simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP) account credentials and the SIM card PIN code. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an unauthorized user access to the underlying email account and SIM card. \n\n- CVE-2022-1794: The CODESYS OPC DA Server prior V3.5.18.20 stores PLC passwords as plain text in its configuration file so that it is visible to all authorized Microsoft Windows users of the system.\n\n- CVE-2022-22458:  IBM Security Verify Governance, Identity Manager 10.0.1 stores user credentials in plain clear text which can be read by a remote authenticated user.

            "matched_text": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\n\nType: Class\n\nStatus: Draft\n\nDescription:\n\nThe product uses a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm or protocol.\n\nExtended Details:\n\n\n\nCryptographic algorithms are the methods by which data is scrambled to prevent observation or influence by unauthorized actors. Insecure cryptography can be exploited to expose sensitive information, modify data in unexpected ways, spoof identities of other users or devices, or other impacts.\n\n\nIt is very difficult to produce a secure algorithm, and even high-profile algorithms by accomplished cryptographic experts have been broken. Well-known techniques exist to break or weaken various kinds of cryptography. Accordingly, there are a small number of well-understood and heavily studied algorithms that should be used by most products. Using a non-standard or known-insecure algorithm is dangerous because a determined adversary may be able to break the algorithm and compromise whatever data has been protected.\n\n\nSince the state of cryptography advances so rapidly, it is common for an algorithm to be considered \"unsafe\" even if it was once thought to be strong. This can happen when new attacks are discovered, or if computing power increases so much that the cryptographic algorithm no longer provides the amount of protection that was originally thought.\n\n\nFor a number of reasons, this weakness is even more challenging to manage with hardware deployment of cryptographic algorithms as opposed to software implementation. First, if a flaw is discovered with hardware-implemented cryptography, the flaw cannot be fixed in most cases without a recall of the product, because hardware is not easily replaceable like software. Second, because the hardware product is expected to work for years, the adversary's computing power will only increase over time.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-30273: SCADA-based protocol supports a legacy encryption mode that uses Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA) in ECB mode, which leaks patterns in messages and cannot protect integrity\n\n- CVE-2022-30320: Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) uses a protocol with a cryptographically insecure hashing algorithm for passwords.\n\n- CVE-2008-3775: Product uses \"ROT-25\" to obfuscate the password in the registry.\n\n- CVE-2007-4150: product only uses \"XOR\" to obfuscate sensitive data\n\n- CVE-2007-5460: product only uses \"XOR\" and a fixed key to obfuscate sensitive data\n\n- CVE-2005-4860: Product substitutes characters with other characters in a fixed way, and also leaves certain input characters unchanged.\n\n- CVE-2002-2058: Attackers can infer private IP addresses by dividing each octet by the MD5 hash of '20'.\n\n- CVE-2008-3188: Product uses DES when MD5 has been specified in the configuration, resulting in weaker-than-expected password hashes.\n\n- CVE-2005-2946: Default configuration of product uses MD5 instead of stronger algorithms that are available, simplifying forgery of certificates.\n\n- CVE-2007-6013: Product uses the hash of a hash for authentication, allowing attackers to gain privileges if they can obtain the original hash.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-15128: In OctoberCMS before version 1.0.468, encrypted cookie values were not tied to the name of the cookie the value belonged to. This meant that certain classes of attacks that took advantage of other theoretical vulnerabilities in user facing code (nothing exploitable in the core project itself) had a higher chance of succeeding. Specifically, if your usage exposed a way for users to provide unfiltered user input and have it returned to them as an encrypted cookie (ex. storing a user provided search query in a cookie) they could then use the generated cookie in place of other more tightly controlled cookies; or if your usage exposed the plaintext version of an encrypted cookie at any point to the user they could theoretically provide encrypted content from your application back to it as an encrypted cookie and force the framework to decrypt it for them. Issue has been fixed in build 468 (v1.0.468).\n\n- CVE-2020-4965: IBM Jazz Team Server products use weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms that could allow an attacker to decrypt highly sensitive information.

An attacker that obtained access to the administrative web interface of a printer (e.g., by using the default credentials) can download the address book file, which contains the list of users (domain users, FTP users, etc.) stored on the printer, together with their encrypted passwords. The passwords are protected by a weak cipher, such as ROT13, which requires minimal effort to instantly retrieve the original password, giving the attacker a list of valid domain or FTP usernames and passwords.\n\n- CVE-2021-43989: mySCADA myPRO Versions 8.20.0 and prior stores passwords using MD5, which may allow an attacker to crack the previously retrieved password hashes.\n\n- CVE-2021-45512: Certain NETGEAR devices are affected by weak cryptography. This affects D7000v2 before 1.0.0.62, D8500 before 1.0.3.50, EX3700 before 1.0.0.84, EX3800 before 1.0.0.84, EX6120 before 1.0.0.54, EX6130 before 1.0.0.36, EX7000 before 1.0.1.90, R6250 before 1.0.4.42, R6400v2 before 1.0.4.98, R6700v3 before 1.0.4.98, R6900P before 1.3.2.124, R7000 before 1.0.11.106, R7000P before 1.3.2.124, R7100LG before 1.0.0.56, R7900 before 1.0.4.26, R8000 before 1.0.4.58, R8300 before 1.0.2.134, R8500 before 1.0.2.134, RS400 before 1.5.0.48, WNR3500Lv2 before 1.2.0.62, and XR300 before 1.0.3.50.\n\n- CVE-2021-45696: An issue was discovered in the sha2 crate 0.9.7 before 0.9.8 for Rust. Hashes of long messages may be incorrect when the AVX2-accelerated backend is used.\n\n- CVE-2022-0377: Users of the LearnPress WordPress plugin before 4.1.5 can upload an image as a profile avatar after the registration. After this process the user crops and saves the image. Then a \"POST\" request that contains user supplied name of the image is sent to the server for renaming and cropping of the image. As a result of this request, the name of the user-supplied image is changed with a MD5 value. This process can be conducted only when type of the image is JPG or PNG. An attacker can use this vulnerability in order to rename an arbitrary image file. By doing this, they could destroy the design of the web site.\n\n- CVE-2022-1252: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm in GitHub repository gnuboard/gnuboard5 prior to and including 5.5.5. A vulnerability in gnuboard v5.5.5 and below uses weak encryption algorithms leading to sensitive information exposure. This allows an attacker to derive the email address of any user, including when the 'Let others see my information.' box is ticked off. Or to send emails to any email address, with full control of its contents \n\n- CVE-2022-1434: The OpenSSL 3.0 implementation of the RC4-MD5 ciphersuite incorrectly uses the AAD data as the MAC key. This makes the MAC key trivially predictable. An attacker could exploit this issue by performing a man-in-the-middle attack to modify data being sent from one endpoint to an OpenSSL 3.0 recipient such that the modified data would still pass the MAC integrity check. Note that data sent from an OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint to a non-OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint will always be rejected by the recipient and the connection will fail at that point. Many application protocols require data to be sent from the client to the server first. Therefore, in such a case, only an OpenSSL 3.0 server would be impacted when talking to a non-OpenSSL 3.0 client. If both endpoints are OpenSSL 3.0 then the attacker could modify data being sent in both directions. In this case both clients and servers could be affected, regardless of the application protocol. Note that in the absence of an attacker this bug means that an OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint communicating with a non-OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint will fail to complete the handshake when using this ciphersuite. The confidentiality of data is not impacted by this issue, i.e. an attacker cannot decrypt data that has been encrypted using this ciphersuite - they can only modify it. In order for this attack to work both endpoints must legitimately negotiate the RC4-MD5 ciphersuite. This ciphersuite is not compiled by default in OpenSSL 3.0, and is not available within the default provider or the default ciphersuite list. This ciphersuite will never be used if TLSv1.3 has been negotiated. In order for an OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint to use this ciphersuite the following must have occurred: 1) OpenSSL must have been compiled with the (non-default) compile time option enable-weak-ssl-ciphers 2) OpenSSL must have had the legacy provider explicitly loaded (either through application code or via configuration) 3) The ciphersuite must have been explicitly added to the ciphersuite list 4) The libssl security level must have been set to 0 (default is 1) 5) A version of SSL/TLS below TLSv1.3 must have been negotiated 6) Both endpoints must negotiate the RC4-MD5 ciphersuite in preference to any others that both endpoints have in common Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.3 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1,3.0.2).\n\n- CVE-2022-20805: A vulnerability in the automatic decryption process in Cisco Umbrella Secure Web Gateway (SWG) could allow an authenticated, adjacent attacker to bypass the SSL decryption and content filtering policies on an affected system. This vulnerability is due to how the decryption function uses the TLS Sever Name Indication (SNI) extension of an HTTP request to discover the destination domain and determine if the request needs to be decrypted. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request over TLS from a client to an unknown or controlled URL. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to bypass the decryption process of Cisco Umbrella SWG and allow malicious content to be downloaded to a host on a protected network. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2022-2097: AES OCB mode for 32-bit x86 platforms using the AES-NI assembly optimised implementation will not encrypt the entirety of the data under some circumstances. This could reveal sixteen bytes of data that was preexisting in the memory that wasn't written. In the special case of \"in place\" encryption, sixteen bytes of the plaintext would be revealed. Since OpenSSL does not support OCB based cipher suites for TLS and DTLS, they are both unaffected. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.5 (Affected 3.0.0-3.0.4). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1q (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1p).\n\n- CVE-2022-2781: In affected versions of Octopus Server it was identified that the same encryption process was used for both encrypting session cookies and variables.\n\n- CVE-2022-28164: Brocade SANnav before SANnav 2.2.0 application uses the Blowfish symmetric encryption algorithm for the storage of passwords. This could allow an authenticated attacker to decrypt stored account passwords.\n\n- CVE-2022-28382: An issue was discovered in certain Verbatim drives through 2022-03-31. Due to the use of an insecure encryption AES mode (Electronic Codebook, aka ECB), an attacker may be able to extract information even from encrypted data, for example by observing repeating byte patterns. The firmware of the USB-to-SATA bridge controller INIC-3637EN uses AES-256 with the ECB mode. This operation mode of block ciphers (e.g., AES) always encrypts identical plaintext data, in this case blocks of 16 bytes, to identical ciphertext data. For some data, for instance bitmap images, the lack of the cryptographic property called diffusion, within ECB, can leak sensitive information even in encrypted data. Thus, the use of the ECB operation mode can put the confidentiality of specific information at risk, even in an encrypted form. This affects Keypad Secure USB 3.2 Gen 1 Drive Part Number #49428, Store 'n' Go Secure Portable HDD GD25LK01-3637-C VER4.0, Executive Fingerprint Secure SSD GDMSFE01-INI3637-C VER1.1, and Fingerprint Secure Portable Hard Drive Part Number #53650.\n\n- CVE-2022-29960: Emerson OpenBSI through 2022-04-29 uses weak cryptography. It is an engineering environment for the ControlWave and Bristol Babcock line of RTUs. DES with hardcoded cryptographic keys is used for protection of certain system credentials, engineering files, and sensitive utilities.\n\n- CVE-2022-30320: Saia Burgess Controls (SBC) PCD through 2022-05-06 uses a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm. According to FSCT-2022-0063, there is a Saia Burgess Controls (SBC) PCD S-Bus weak credential hashing scheme issue. The affected components are characterized as: S-Bus (5050/UDP) authentication. The potential impact is: Authentication bypass. The Saia Burgess Controls (SBC) PCD controllers utilize the S-Bus protocol (5050/UDP) for a variety of engineering purposes. It is possible to configure a password in order to restrict access to sensitive engineering functionality. Authentication is done by using the S-Bus 'write byte' message to a specific address and supplying a hashed version of the password. The hashing algorithm used is based on CRC-16 and as such not cryptographically secure. An insecure hashing algorithm is used. An attacker capable of passively observing traffic can intercept the hashed credentials and trivially find collisions allowing for authentication without having to bruteforce a keyspace defined by the actual strength of the password. This allows the attacker access to sensitive engineering functionality such as uploading/downloading control logic and manipulating controller configuration.\n\n- CVE-2022-35513: The Blink1Control2 application <= 2.2.7 uses weak password encryption and an insecure method of storage.\n\n- CVE-2022-38493: Rhonabwy 0.9.99 through 1.1.x before 1.1.7 doesn't check the RSA private key length before RSA-OAEP decryption. This allows attackers to cause a Denial of Service via a crafted JWE (JSON Web Encryption) token.\n\n- CVE-2022-39237: syslabs/sif is the Singularity Image Format (SIF) reference implementation. In versions prior to 2.8.1the `github.com/sylabs/sif/v2/pkg/integrity` package did not verify that the hash algorithm(s) used are cryptographically secure when verifying digital signatures. A patch is available in version >= v2.8.1 of the module. Users are encouraged to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may independently validate that the hash algorithm(s) used for metadata digest(s) and signature hash are cryptographically secure.\n\n- CVE-2022-28166: In Brocade SANnav version before SANN2.2.0.2 and Brocade SANNav before 2.1.1.8, the implementation of TLS/SSL Server Supports the Use of Static Key Ciphers (ssl-static-key-ciphers) on ports 443 & 18082.\n\n- CVE-2022-30187: Azure Storage Library Information Disclosure Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-23839: OpenSSL 1.0.2 supports SSLv2. If a client attempts to negotiate SSLv2 with a server that is configured to support both SSLv2 and more recent SSL and TLS versions then a check is made for a version rollback attack when unpadding an RSA signature. Clients that support SSL or TLS versions greater than SSLv2 are supposed to use a special form of padding. A server that supports greater than SSLv2 is supposed to reject connection attempts from a client where this special form of padding is present, because this indicates that a version rollback has occurred (i.e. both client and server support greater than SSLv2, and yet this is the version that is being requested). The implementation of this padding check inverted the logic so that the connection attempt is accepted if the padding is present, and rejected if it is absent. This means that such as server will accept a connection if a version rollback attack has occurred. Further the server will erroneously reject a connection if a normal SSLv2 connection attempt is made. Only OpenSSL 1.0.2 servers from version 1.0.2s to 1.0.2x are affected by this issue. In order to be vulnerable a 1.0.2 server must: 1) have configured SSLv2 support at compile time (this is off by default), 2) have configured SSLv2 support at runtime (this is off by default), 3) have configured SSLv2 ciphersuites (these are not in the default ciphersuite list) OpenSSL 1.1.1 does not have SSLv2 support and therefore is not vulnerable to this issue. The underlying error is in the implementation of the RSA_padding_check_SSLv23() function. This also affects the RSA_SSLV23_PADDING padding mode used by various other functions. Although 1.1.1 does not support SSLv2 the RSA_padding_check_SSLv23() function still exists, as does the RSA_SSLV23_PADDING padding mode. Applications that directly call that function or use that padding mode will encounter this issue. However since there is no support for the SSLv2 protocol in 1.1.1 this is considered a bug and not a security issue in that version. OpenSSL 1.0.2 is out of support and no longer receiving public updates. Premium support customers of OpenSSL 1.0.2 should upgrade to 1.0.2y. Other users should upgrade to 1.1.1j. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2y (Affected 1.0.2s-1.0.2x).\n\n- CVE-2021-20379: IBM Guardium Data Encryption (GDE) 3.0.0.3 and 4.0.0.4 uses weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms that could allow an attacker to decrypt highly sensitive information. IBM X-Force ID: 195711.\n\n- CVE-2021-20406: IBM Security Verify Information Queue 1.0.6 and 1.0.7 uses weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms that could allow an attacker to decrypt highly sensitive information.

IBM X-Force ID: 199238.\n\n- CVE-2021-22212: ntpkeygen can generate keys that ntpd fails to parse. NTPsec 1.2.0 allows ntpkeygen to generate keys with '#' characters. ntpd then either pads, shortens the key, or fails to load these keys entirely, depending on the key type and the placement of the '#'. This results in the administrator not being able to use the keys as expected or the keys are shorter than expected and easier to brute-force, possibly resulting in MITM attacks between ntp clients and ntp servers. For short AES128 keys, ntpd generates a warning that it is padding them.\n\n- CVE-2021-22356: There is a weak secure algorithm vulnerability in Huawei products. A weak secure algorithm is used in a module. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by capturing and analyzing the messages between devices to obtain information.

Versions 2.2 and earlier for release builds and versions 425 and earlier for nightly builds suffer from use of a weak cryptographic algorithm (RSA/ECB/PKCS1Padding). The issue will be patched in v2.3 for release builds and 426 onwards for nightly builds. As a workaround, one may disable an advance security feature if not required.\n\n- CVE-2021-41278: Functions SDK for EdgeX is meant to provide all the plumbing necessary for developers to get started in processing/transforming/exporting data out of the EdgeX IoT platform. In affected versions broken encryption in app-functions-sdk \u201cAES\u201d transform in EdgeX Foundry releases prior to Jakarta allows attackers to decrypt messages via unspecified vectors. The app-functions-sdk exports an \u201caes\u201d transform that user scripts can optionally call to encrypt data in the processing pipeline. No decrypt function is provided. Encryption is not enabled by default, but if used, the level of protection may be less than the user may expects due to a broken implementation. Version v2.1.0 (EdgeX Foundry Jakarta release and later) of app-functions-sdk-go/v2 deprecates the \u201caes\u201d transform and provides an improved \u201caes256\u201d transform in its place. The broken implementation will remain in a deprecated state until it is removed in the next EdgeX major release to avoid breakage of existing software that depends on the broken implementation. As the broken transform is a library function that is not invoked by default, users who do not use the AES transform in their processing pipelines are unaffected. Those that are affected are urged to upgrade to the Jakarta EdgeX release and modify processing pipelines to use the new \"aes256\" transform.\n\n- CVE-2021-42583: A Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm exists in Max Mazurov Maddy before 0.5.2, which is an unnecessary risk that may result in the exposure of sensitive information.\n\n- CVE-2021-43550: The use of a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm is an unnecessary risk that may result in the exposure of sensitive information, which affects the communications between Patient Information Center iX (PIC iX) Versions C.02 and C.03 and Efficia CM Series Revisions A.01 to C.0x and 4.0.\n\n- CVE-2022-20117: In (TBD) of (TBD), there is a possible way to decrypt local data encrypted by the GSC due to improperly used crypto.

Without use of quotas, resource limits, or other protection mechanisms, it can be easy for an attacker to consume many resources by rapidly making many requests, or causing larger resources to be used than is needed. When too many resources are allocated, or if a single resource is too large, then it can prevent the code from working correctly, possibly leading to a denial of service.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-21668: Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).\n\n- CVE-2009-4017: Language interpreter does not restrict the number of temporary files being created when handling a MIME request with a large number of parts..\n\n- CVE-2009-2726: Driver does not use a maximum width when invoking sscanf style functions, causing stack consumption.\n\n- CVE-2009-2540: Large integer value for a length property in an object causes a large amount of memory allocation.\n\n- CVE-2009-2054: Product allows exhaustion of file descriptors when processing a large number of TCP packets.\n\n- CVE-2008-5180: Communication product allows memory consumption with a large number of SIP requests, which cause many sessions to be created.\n\n- CVE-2008-1700: Product allows attackers to cause a denial of service via a large number of directives, each of which opens a separate window.\n\n- CVE-2005-4650: CMS does not restrict the number of searches that can occur simultaneously, leading to resource exhaustion.\n\n- CVE-2020-15100: web application scanner attempts to read an excessively large file created by a user, causing process termination\n\n- CVE-2020-7218: Go-based workload orchestrator does not limit resource usage with unauthenticated connections, allowing a DoS by flooding the service\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-19463: An issue has been found in function vfprintf in PDF2JSON 0.70 that allows attackers to cause a Denial of Service due to a stack overflow.\n\n- CVE-2020-19464: An issue has been found in function XRef::fetch in PDF2JSON 0.70 that allows attackers to cause a Denial of Service due to a stack overflow .\n\n- CVE-2021-29324: OpenSource Moddable v10.5.0 was discovered to contain a stack overflow via the component /moddable/xs/sources/xsScript.c.\n\n- CVE-2021-29329: OpenSource Moddable v10.5.0 was discovered to contain a stack overflow in the fxBinaryExpressionNodeDistribute function at /moddable/xs/sources/xsTree.c.\n\n- CVE-2021-41800: MediaWiki before 1.36.2 allows a denial of service (resource consumption because of lengthy query processing time). Visiting Special:Contributions can sometimes result in a long running SQL query because PoolCounter protection is mishandled.\n\n- CVE-2021-35492: Wowza Streaming Engine through 4.8.11+5 could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to exhaust filesystem resources via the /enginemanager/server/vhost/historical.jsdata vhost parameter. This is due to the insufficient management of available filesystem resources. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability through the Virtual Host Monitoring section by requesting random virtual-host historical data and exhausting available filesystem resources. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause database errors and cause the device to become unresponsive to web-based management. (Manual intervention is required to free filesystem resources and return the application to an operational state.)\n\n- CVE-2021-22174: Crash in USB HID dissector in Wireshark 3.4.0 to 3.4.2 allows denial of service via packet injection or crafted capture file\n\n- CVE-2020-22785: Etherpad < 1.8.3 is affected by a missing lock check which could cause a denial of service.

Patch ID: ALPS05403499; Issue ID: ALPS05393787.\n\n- CVE-2021-20185: It was found in Moodle before version 3.10.1, 3.9.4, 3.8.7 and 3.5.16 that messaging did not impose a character limit when sending messages, which could result in client-side (browser) denial of service for users receiving very large messages.\n\n- CVE-2021-29430: Sydent is a reference Matrix identity server. Sydent does not limit the size of requests it receives from HTTP clients. A malicious user could send an HTTP request with a very large body, leading to memory exhaustion and denial of service. Sydent also does not limit response size for requests it makes to remote Matrix homeservers. A malicious homeserver could return a very large response, again leading to memory exhaustion and denial of service. This affects any server which accepts registration requests from untrusted clients. This issue has been patched by releases 89071a1, 0523511, f56eee3. As a workaround request sizes can be limited in an HTTP reverse-proxy. There are no known workarounds for the problem with overlarge responses.\n\n- CVE-2021-29932: An issue was discovered in the parse_duration crate through 2021-03-18 for Rust. It allows attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU and memory consumption) via a duration string with a large exponent.\n\n- CVE-2021-32699: Wings is the control plane software for the open source Pterodactyl game management system. All versions of Pterodactyl Wings prior to `1.4.4` are vulnerable to system resource exhaustion due to improper container process limits being defined. A malicious user can consume more resources than intended and cause downstream impacts to other clients on the same hardware, eventually causing the physical server to stop responding. Users should upgrade to `1.4.4` to mitigate the issue. There is no non-code based workaround for impacted versions of the software. Users running customized versions of this software can manually set a PID limit for containers created.\n\n- CVE-2021-3478: There's a flaw in OpenEXR's scanline input file functionality in versions before 3.0.0-beta. An attacker able to submit a crafted file to be processed by OpenEXR could consume excessive system memory. The greatest impact of this flaw is to system availability.\n\n- CVE-2021-38463: The affected product does not properly control the allocation of resources. A user may be able to allocate unlimited memory buffers using API functions.\n\n- CVE-2021-38465: The webinstaller is a Golang web server executable that enables the generation of an Auvesy image agent. Resource consumption can be achieved by generating large amounts of installations, which are then saved without limitation in the temp folder of the webinstaller executable.\n\n- CVE-2021-3912: OctoRPKI tries to load the entire contents of a repository in memory, and in the case of a GZIP bomb, unzip it in memory, making it possible to create a repository that makes OctoRPKI run out of memory (and thus crash).\n\n- CVE-2021-41546: A vulnerability has been identified in RUGGEDCOM ROX MX5000 (All versions < V2.14.1), RUGGEDCOM ROX RX1400 (All versions < V2.14.1), RUGGEDCOM ROX RX1500 (All versions < V2.14.1), RUGGEDCOM ROX RX1501 (All versions < V2.14.1), RUGGEDCOM ROX RX1510 (All versions < V2.14.1), RUGGEDCOM ROX RX1511 (All versions < V2.14.1), RUGGEDCOM ROX RX1512 (All versions < V2.14.1), RUGGEDCOM ROX RX1524 (All versions < V2.14.1), RUGGEDCOM ROX RX1536 (All versions < V2.14.1), RUGGEDCOM ROX RX5000 (All versions < V2.14.1). Affected devices write crashdumps without checking if enough space is available on the filesystem. Once the crashdump fills the entire root filesystem, affected devices fail to boot successfully. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to cause a permanent Denial-of-Service.\n\n- CVE-2021-21274: Synapse is a Matrix reference homeserver written in python (pypi package matrix-synapse). Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and VoIP. In Synapse before version 1.25.0, a malicious homeserver could redirect requests to their .well-known file to a large file. This can lead to a denial of service attack where homeservers will consume significantly more resources when requesting the .well-known file of a malicious homeserver. This affects any server which accepts federation requests from untrusted servers. Issue is resolved in version 1.25.0. As a workaround the `federation_domain_whitelist` setting can be used to restrict the homeservers communicated with over federation.\n\n- CVE-2021-21294: Http4s (http4s-blaze-server) is a minimal, idiomatic Scala interface for HTTP services. Http4s before versions 0.21.17, 0.22.0-M2, and 1.0.0-M14 have a vulnerability which can lead to a denial-of-service. Blaze-core, a library underlying http4s-blaze-server, accepts connections unboundedly on its selector pool. This has the net effect of amplifying degradation in services that are unable to handle their current request load, since incoming connections are still accepted and added to an unbounded queue. Each connection allocates a socket handle, which drains a scarce OS resource. This can also confound higher level circuit breakers which work based on detecting failed connections. http4s provides a general \"MaxActiveRequests\" middleware mechanism for limiting open connections, but it is enforced inside the Blaze accept loop, after the connection is accepted and the socket opened. Thus, the limit only prevents the number of connections which can be simultaneously processed, not the number of connections which can be held open. In 0.21.17, 0.22.0-M2, and 1.0.0-M14, a new \"maxConnections\" property, with a default value of 1024, has been added to the `BlazeServerBuilder`. Setting the value to a negative number restores unbounded behavior, but is strongly disrecommended. The NIO2 backend does not respect `maxConnections`. Its use is now deprecated in http4s-0.21, and the option is removed altogether starting in http4s-0.22. There are several possible workarounds described in the refrenced GitHub Advisory GHSA-xhv5-w9c5-2r2w.\n\n- CVE-2021-23053: On version 15.1.x before 15.1.3, 14.1.x before 14.1.3.1, and 13.1.x before 13.1.3.6, when the brute force protection feature of BIG-IP Advanced WAF or BIG-IP ASM is enabled on a virtual server and the virtual server is under brute force attack, the MySQL database may run out of disk space due to lack of row limit on undisclosed tables in the MYSQL database.

The ExecSync request runs commands in a container and logs the output of the command. This output is then read by CRI-O after command execution, and it is read in a manner where the entire file corresponding to the output of the command is read in. Thus, if the output of the command is large it is possible to exhaust the memory or the disk space of the node when CRI-O reads the output of the command. The highest threat from this vulnerability is system availability.\n\n- CVE-2022-20143: In addAutomaticZenRule of ZenModeHelper.java, there is a possible permanent denial of service due to resource exhaustion.

Versions older than `v0.38.0` of js-libp2p are vulnerable to targeted resource exhaustion attacks. These attacks target libp2p\u2019s connection, stream, peer, and memory management. An attacker can cause the allocation of large amounts of memory, ultimately leading to the process getting killed by the host\u2019s operating system. While a connection manager tasked with keeping the number of connections within manageable limits has been part of js-libp2p, this component was designed to handle the regular churn of peers, not a targeted resource exhaustion attack. Users are advised to update their js-libp2p dependency to `v0.38.0` or greater. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2022-23492: go-libp2p is the offical libp2p implementation in the Go programming language. Version `0.18.0` and older of go-libp2p are vulnerable to targeted resource exhaustion attacks. These attacks target libp2p\u2019s connection, stream, peer, and memory management. An attacker can cause the allocation of large amounts of memory, ultimately leading to the process getting killed by the host\u2019s operating system. While a connection manager tasked with keeping the number of connections within manageable limits has been part of go-libp2p, this component was designed to handle the regular churn of peers, not a targeted resource exhaustion attack. Users are advised to upgrade their version of go-libp2p to version `0.18.1` or newer. Users unable to upgrade may consult the denial of service (dos) mitigation page for more information on how to incorporate mitigation strategies, monitor your application, and respond to attacks.\n\n- CVE-2022-23913: In Apache ActiveMQ Artemis prior to 2.20.0 or 2.19.1, an attacker could partially disrupt availability (DoS) through uncontrolled resource consumption of memory.\n\n- CVE-2022-2406: The legacy Slack import feature in Mattermost version 6.7.0 and earlier fails to properly limit the sizes of imported files, which allows an authenticated attacker to crash the server by importing large files via the Slack import REST API.\n\n- CVE-2022-28871: A Denial-of-Service (DoS) vulnerability was discovered in F-Secure Atlant whereby the fsicapd component used in certain F-Secure products while scanning larger packages/fuzzed files consume too much memory eventually can crash the scanning engine. The exploit can be triggered remotely by an attacker.\n\n- CVE-2022-31075: KubeEdge is an open source system for extending native containerized application orchestration capabilities to hosts at Edge. Prior to versions 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4, EdgeCore may be susceptible to a DoS attack on CloudHub if an attacker was to send a well-crafted HTTP request to `/edge.crt`. If an attacker can send a well-crafted HTTP request to CloudHub, and that request has a very large body, that request can crash the HTTP service through a memory exhaustion vector. The request body is being read into memory, and a body that is larger than the available memory can lead to a successful attack. Because the request would have to make it through authorization, only authorized users may perform this attack. The consequence of the exhaustion is that CloudHub will be in denial of service. KubeEdge is affected only when users enable the CloudHub module in the file `cloudcore.yaml`. This bug has been fixed in Kubeedge 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4. As a workaround, disable the CloudHub switch in the config file `cloudcore.yaml`.\n\n- CVE-2022-31078: KubeEdge is an open source system for extending native containerized application orchestration capabilities to hosts at Edge. Prior to versions 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4, the CloudCore Router does not impose a limit on the size of responses to requests made by the REST handler. An attacker could use this weakness to make a request that will return an HTTP response with a large body and cause DoS of CloudCore. In the HTTP Handler API, the rest handler makes a request to a pre-specified handle. The handle will return an HTTP response that is then read into memory. The consequence of the exhaustion is that CloudCore will be in a denial of service. Only an authenticated user of the cloud can make an attack. It will be affected only when users enable `router` module in the config file `cloudcore.yaml`. This bug has been fixed in Kubeedge 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4. As a workaround, disable the router switch in the config file `cloudcore.yaml`.\n\n- CVE-2022-31079: KubeEdge is an open source system for extending native containerized application orchestration capabilities to hosts at Edge. Prior to versions 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4, the Cloud Stream server and the Edge Stream server reads the entire message into memory without imposing a limit on the size of this message. An attacker can exploit this by sending a large message to exhaust memory and cause a DoS. The Cloud Stream server and the Edge Stream server are under DoS attack in this case. The consequence of the exhaustion is that the CloudCore and EdgeCore will be in a denial of service. Only an authenticated user can cause this issue. It will be affected only when users enable `cloudStream` module in the config file `cloudcore.yaml` and enable `edgeStream` module in the config file `edgecore.yaml`. This bug has been fixed in Kubeedge 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4. As a workaround, disable cloudStream module in the config file `cloudcore.yaml` and disable edgeStream module in the config file `edgecore.yaml`.\n\n- CVE-2022-3147: Mattermost version 7.0.x and earlier fails to sufficiently limit the in-memory sizes of concurrently uploaded JPEG images, which allows authenticated users to cause resource exhaustion on specific system configurations, resulting in server-side Denial of Service.\n\n- CVE-2022-33749: XAPI open file limit DoS It is possible for an unauthenticated client on the network to cause XAPI to hit its file-descriptor limit. This causes XAPI to be unable to accept new requests for other (trusted) clients, and blocks XAPI from carrying out any tasks that require the opening of file descriptors.\n\n- CVE-2022-3423: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling in GitHub repository nocodb/nocodb prior to 0.92.0. \n\n- CVE-2022-35915: OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for secure smart contract development. The target contract of an EIP-165 `supportsInterface` query can cause unbounded gas consumption by returning a lot of data, while it is generally assumed that this operation has a bounded cost. The issue has been fixed in v4.7.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-41932: XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. It's possible to make XWiki create many new schemas and fill them with tables just by using a crafted user identifier in the login form. This may lead to degraded database performance. The problem has been patched in XWiki 13.10.8, 14.6RC1 and 14.4.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-2134: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling in GitHub repository inventree/inventree prior to 0.8.0.\n\n- CVE-2022-43686: In Concrete CMS (formerly concrete5) below 8.5.10 and between 9.0.0 and 9.1.2, the authTypeConcreteCookieMap table can be filled up causing a denial of service (high load).\n\n- CVE-2022-41725: A denial of service is possible from excessive resource consumption in net/http and mime/multipart. Multipart form parsing with mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm can consume largely unlimited amounts of memory and disk files. This also affects form parsing in the net/http package with the Request methods FormFile, FormValue, ParseMultipartForm, and PostFormValue. ReadForm takes a maxMemory parameter, and is documented as storing \"up to maxMemory bytes +10MB (reserved for non-file parts) in memory\". File parts which cannot be stored in memory are stored on disk in temporary files. The unconfigurable 10MB reserved for non-file parts is excessively large and can potentially open a denial of service vector on its own. However, ReadForm did not properly account for all memory consumed by a parsed form, such as map entry overhead, part names, and MIME headers, permitting a maliciously crafted form to consume well over 10MB. In addition, ReadForm contained no limit on the number of disk files created, permitting a relatively small request body to create a large number of disk temporary files. With fix, ReadForm now properly accounts for various forms of memory overhead, and should now stay within its documented limit of 10MB + maxMemory bytes of memory consumption. Users should still be aware that this limit is high and may still be hazardous. In addition, ReadForm now creates at most one on-disk temporary file, combining multiple form parts into a single temporary file. The mime/multipart.File interface type's documentation states, \"If stored on disk, the File's underlying concrete type will be an *os.File.\". This is no longer the case when a form contains more than one file part, due to this coalescing of parts into a single file. The previous behavior of using distinct files for each form part may be reenabled with the environment variable GODEBUG=multipartfiles=distinct. Users should be aware that multipart.ReadForm and the http.Request methods that call it do not limit the amount of disk consumed by temporary files. Callers can limit the size of form data with http.MaxBytesReader.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-400 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-665 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-400 (ChildOf)",

However, when these credentials are easily predictable or even fixed (as with default or hard-coded passwords and keys), then the attacker can defeat the mechanism without relying on brute force.\n\n\nCredentials may be weak for different reasons, such as:\n\n\n  - Hard-coded (i.e., static and unchangeable by the administrator)\n\n  - Default (i.e., the same static value across different deployments/installations, but able to be changed by the administrator)\n\n  - Predictable (i.e., generated in a way that produces unique credentials across deployments/installations, but can still be guessed with reasonable efficiency)\n\nEven if a new, unique credential is intended to be generated for each product installation, if the generation is predictable, then that may also simplify guessing attacks.\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- [REF-1374]: Chain: JavaScript-based cryptocurrency library can fall back to the insecure Math.random() function instead of reporting a failure (CWE-392), thus reducing the entropy (CWE-332) and leading to generation of non-unique cryptographic keys for Bitcoin wallets (CWE-1391)\n\n- CVE-2022-30270: Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) uses default credentials for some SSH accounts\n\n- CVE-2022-29965: Distributed Control System (DCS) uses a deterministic algorithm to generate utility passwords\n\n- CVE-2022-30271: Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) uses a hard-coded SSH private key that is likely to be used in typical deployments\n\n- CVE-2021-38759: microcontroller board has default password, allowing admin access\n\n- CVE-2021-41192: data visualization/sharing package uses default secret keys or cookie values if they are not specified in environment variables\n\n- CVE-2020-8994: UART interface for AI speaker uses empty password for root shell\n\n- CVE-2020-27020: password manager does not generate cryptographically strong passwords, allowing prediction of passwords using guessable details such as time of generation\n\n- CVE-2020-8632: password generator for cloud application has small length value, making it easier for brute-force guessing\n\n- CVE-2020-5365: network-attached storage (NAS) system has predictable default passwords for a diagnostics/support account\n\n- CVE-2020-5248: IT asset management app has a default encryption key that is the same across installations\n\n- CVE-2018-3825: cloud cluster management product has a default master encryption key\n\n- CVE-2012-3503: Installation script has a hard-coded secret token value, allowing attackers to bypass authentication\n\n- CVE-2010-2306: Intrusion Detection System (IDS) uses the same static, private SSL keys for multiple devices and installations, allowing decryption of SSL traffic\n\n- CVE-2001-0618: Residential gateway uses the last 5 digits of the 'Network Name' or SSID as the default WEP key, which allows attackers to get the key by sniffing the SSID, which is sent in the clear\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-3875: A vulnerability classified as critical was found in Click Studios Passwordstate and Passwordstate Browser Extension Chrome. This vulnerability affects unknown code of the component API. The manipulation leads to authentication bypass by assumed-immutable data. The attack can be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component. The identifier of this vulnerability is VDB-216244.\n\n- CVE-2021-3979: A key length flaw was found in Red Hat Ceph Storage. An attacker can exploit the fact that the key length is incorrectly passed in an encryption algorithm to create a non random key, which is weaker and can be exploited for loss of confidentiality and integrity on encrypted disks.\n\n- CVE-2021-42949: The component controlla_login function in HotelDruid Hotel Management Software v3.0.3 generates a predictable session token, allowing attackers to bypass authentication via bruteforce attacks.\n\n- CVE-2022-23555: authentik is an open-source Identity Provider focused on flexibility and versatility. Versions prior to 2022.11.4 and 2022.10.4 are vulnerable to Improper Authentication. Token reuse in invitation URLs leads to access control bypass via the use of a different enrollment flow than in the one provided. The vulnerability allows an attacker that knows different invitation flows names (e.g. `enrollment-invitation-test` and `enrollment-invitation-admin`) via either different invite links or via brute forcing to signup via a single invitation url for any valid invite link received (it can even be a url for a third flow as long as it's a valid invite) as the token used in the `Invitations` section of the Admin interface does NOT change when a different `enrollment flow` is selected via the interface and it is NOT bound to the selected flow, so it will be valid for any flow when used. This issue is patched in authentik 2022.11.4,2022.10.4 and 2022.12.0. Only configurations that use invitations and have multiple enrollment flows with invitation stages that grant different permissions are affected. The default configuration is not vulnerable, and neither are configurations with a single enrollment flow. As a workaround, fixed data can be added to invitations which can be checked in the flow to deny requests.

            "matched_text": "CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\n\nType: Base\n\nStatus: Draft\n\nDescription:\n\nTo fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non-standard, unproven, or disallowed/non-compliant cryptographic implementation.\n\nExtended Details:\n\n\n\nCryptographic protocols and systems depend on cryptographic primitives (and associated algorithms) as their basic building blocks. Some common examples of primitives are digital signatures, one-way hash functions, ciphers, and public key cryptography; however, the notion of \"primitive\" can vary depending on point of view. See \"Terminology Notes\" for further explanation of some concepts.\n\n\nCryptographic primitives are defined to accomplish one very specific task in a precisely defined and mathematically reliable fashion. For example, suppose that for a specific cryptographic primitive (such as an encryption routine), the consensus is that the primitive can only be broken after trying out N different inputs (where the larger the value of N, the stronger the cryptography). For an encryption scheme like AES-256, one would expect N to be so large as to be infeasible to execute in a reasonable amount of time.\n\n\nIf a vulnerability is ever found that shows that one can break a cryptographic primitive in significantly less than the expected number of attempts, then that primitive is considered weakened (or sometimes in extreme cases, colloquially it is \"broken\"). As a result, anything using this cryptographic primitive would now be considered insecure or risky. Thus, even breaking or weakening a seemingly small cryptographic primitive has the potential to render the whole system vulnerable, due to its reliance on the primitive. A historical example can be found in TLS when using DES. One would colloquially call DES the cryptographic primitive for transport encryption in this version of TLS. In the past, DES was considered strong, because no weaknesses were found in it; importantly, DES has a key length of 56 bits. Trying N=2^56 keys was considered impractical for most actors. Unfortunately, attacking a system with 56-bit keys is now practical via brute force, which makes defeating DES encryption practical. It is now practical for an adversary to read any information sent under this version of TLS and use this information to attack the system. As a result, it can be claimed that this use of TLS is weak, and that any system depending on TLS with DES could potentially render the entire system vulnerable to attack.\n\n\nCryptographic primitives and associated algorithms are only considered safe after extensive research and review from experienced cryptographers from academia, industry, and government entities looking for any possible flaws. Furthermore, cryptographic primitives and associated algorithms are frequently reevaluated for safety when new mathematical and attack techniques are discovered. As a result and over time, even well-known cryptographic primitives can lose their compliance status with the discovery of novel attacks that might either defeat the algorithm or reduce its robustness significantly.\n\n\nIf ad-hoc cryptographic primitives are implemented, it is almost certain that the implementation will be vulnerable to attacks that are well understood by cryptographers, resulting in the exposure of sensitive information and other consequences.\n\n\nThis weakness is even more difficult to manage for hardware-implemented deployment of cryptographic algorithms. First, because hardware is not patchable as easily as software, any flaw discovered after release and production typically cannot be fixed without a recall of the product. Secondly, the hardware product is often expected to work for years, during which time computation power available to the attacker only increases. Therefore, for hardware implementations of cryptographic primitives, it is absolutely essential that only strong, proven cryptographic primitives are used.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-4778: software uses MD5, which is less safe than the default SHA-256 used by related products\n\n- CVE-2005-2946: Default configuration of product uses MD5 instead of stronger algorithms that are available, simplifying forgery of certificates.\n\n- CVE-2019-3907: identity card uses MD5 hash of a salt and password\n\n- CVE-2021-34687: personal key is transmitted over the network using a substitution cipher\n\n- CVE-2020-14254: product does not disable TLS-RSA cipher suites, allowing decryption of traffic if TLS 2.0 and secure ciphers are not enabled.\n\n- CVE-2019-1543: SSL/TLS library generates 16-byte nonces but reduces them to 12 byte nonces for the ChaCha20-Poly1305 cipher, converting them in a way that violates the cipher's requirements for unique nonces.\n\n- CVE-2017-9267: LDAP interface allows use of weak ciphers\n\n- CVE-2017-7971: SCADA product allows \"use of outdated cipher suites\"\n\n- CVE-2020-6616: Chip implementing Bluetooth uses a low-entropy PRNG instead of a hardware RNG, allowing spoofing.\n\n- CVE-2019-1715: security product has insufficient entropy in the DRBG, allowing collisions and private key discovery\n\n- CVE-2014-4192: Dual_EC_DRBG implementation in RSA toolkit does not correctly handle certain byte requests, simplifying plaintext recovery\n\n- CVE-2007-6755: Recommendation for Dual_EC_DRBG algorithm contains point Q constants that could simplify decryption\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-34687: iDrive RemotePC before 7.6.48 on Windows allows information disclosure. A man in the middle can recover a system's Personal Key when a client attempts to make a LAN connection. The Personal Key is transmitted over the network while only being encrypted via a substitution cipher.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-327 (ChildOf)",

However, even for later versions, this weakness is still possible depending on configuration.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-44228:** Product does not neutralize ${xyz} style expressions, allowing remote code execution. (log4shell vulnerability in log4j)\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product transmits or stores authentication credentials, but it uses an insecure method that is susceptible to unauthorized interception and/or retrieval.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-1390\nChildOf -> CWE-287\nChildOf -> CWE-668\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-30018:** A messaging platform serializes all elements of User/Group objects, making private information available to adversaries\n- **CVE-2022-29959:** Initialization file contains credentials that can be decoded using a \"simple string transformation\"\n- **CVE-2022-35411:** Python-based RPC framework enables pickle functionality by default, allowing clients to unpickle untrusted data.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nBecause the information is stored in cleartext (i.e., unencrypted), attackers could potentially read it. Even if the information is encoded in a way that is not human-readable, certain techniques could determine which encoding is being used, then decode the information.\n\n\nWhen organizations adopt cloud services, it can be easier for attackers to access the data from anywhere on the Internet.\n\n\nIn some systems/environments such as cloud, the use of \"double encryption\" (at both the software and hardware layer) might be required, and the developer might be solely responsible for both layers, instead of shared responsibility with the administrator of the broader system/environment.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-311\nChildOf -> CWE-311\nChildOf -> CWE-922\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Terminology]** Different people use \"cleartext\" and \"plaintext\" to mean the same thing: the lack of encryption. However, within cryptography, these have more precise meanings. Plaintext is the information just before it is fed into a cryptographic algorithm, including already-encrypted text. Cleartext is any information that is unencrypted, although it might be in an encoded form that is not easily human-readable (such as base64 encoding).\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-30275:** Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) uses a driver that relies on a password stored in plaintext.\n- **CVE-2009-2272:** password and username stored in cleartext in a cookie\n- **CVE-2009-1466:** password stored in cleartext in a file with insecure permissions\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nStoring a password in plaintext may result in a system compromise.\n\n### Extended Description\nPassword management issues occur when a password is stored in plaintext in an application's properties, configuration file, or memory. Storing a plaintext password in a configuration file allows anyone who can read the file access to the password-protected resource. In some contexts, even storage of a plaintext password in memory is considered a security risk if the password is not cleared immediately after it is used.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-522\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).\n**Comments:** Consider children CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information or CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information.\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** There is an overlapping relationship between insecure storage of sensitive information (CWE-922) and missing encryption of sensitive information (CWE-311). Encryption is often used to prevent an attacker from reading the sensitive data. However, encryption does not prevent the attacker from erasing or overwriting the data.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2009-2272:** password and username stored in cleartext in a cookie\n- **CVE-2009-1466:** password stored in cleartext in a file with insecure permissions\n- **CVE-2009-0152:** chat program disables SSL in some circumstances even when the user says to use SSL.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-208: Observable Timing Discrepancy\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nTwo separate operations in a product require different amounts of time to complete, in a way that is observable to an actor and reveals security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\n\n### Extended Description\nIn security-relevant contexts, even small variations in timing can be exploited by attackers to indirectly infer certain details about the product's internal operations. For example, in some cryptographic algorithms, attackers can use timing differences to infer certain properties about a private key, making the key easier to guess. Timing discrepancies effectively form a timing side channel.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-203\nCanPrecede -> CWE-385\nCanPrecede -> CWE-327\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** Often primary in cryptographic applications and algorithms.\n\n**[Maintenance]** CWE 4.16 removed a demonstrative example for a hardware module because it was inaccurate and unable to be adapted. The CWE team is developing an alternative.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2019-10071:** Java-oriented framework compares HMAC signatures using String.equals() instead of a constant-time algorithm, causing timing discrepancies\n- **CVE-2019-10482:** Smartphone OS uses comparison functions that are not in constant time, allowing side channels\n- **CVE-2014-0984:** Password-checking function in router terminates validation of a password entry when it encounters the first incorrect character, which allows remote attackers to obtain passwords via a brute-force attack that relies on timing differences in responses to incorrect password guesses, aka a timing side-channel attack.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product uses a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm or protocol.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nCryptographic algorithms are the methods by which data is scrambled to prevent observation or influence by unauthorized actors. Insecure cryptography can be exploited to expose sensitive information, modify data in unexpected ways, spoof identities of other users or devices, or other impacts.\n\n\nIt is very difficult to produce a secure algorithm, and even high-profile algorithms by accomplished cryptographic experts have been broken. Well-known techniques exist to break or weaken various kinds of cryptography. Accordingly, there are a small number of well-understood and heavily studied algorithms that should be used by most products. Using a non-standard or known-insecure algorithm is dangerous because a determined adversary may be able to break the algorithm and compromise whatever data has been protected.\n\n\nSince the state of cryptography advances so rapidly, it is common for an algorithm to be considered \"unsafe\" even if it was once thought to be strong. This can happen when new attacks are discovered, or if computing power increases so much that the cryptographic algorithm no longer provides the amount of protection that was originally thought.\n\n\nFor a number of reasons, this weakness is even more challenging to manage with hardware deployment of cryptographic algorithms as opposed to software implementation. First, if a flaw is discovered with hardware-implemented cryptography, the flaw cannot be fixed in most cases without a recall of the product, because hardware is not easily replaceable like software. Second, because the hardware product is expected to work for years, the adversary's computing power will only increase over time.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-693\nPeerOf -> CWE-311\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** Since CWE 4.4, various cryptography-related entries, including CWE-327 and CWE-1240, have been slated for extensive research, analysis, and community consultation to define consistent terminology, improve relationships, and reduce overlap or duplication. As of CWE 4.6, this work is still ongoing.\n\n**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the \"Mapping CWE to 62443\" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-30273:** SCADA-based protocol supports a legacy encryption mode that uses Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA) in ECB mode, which leaks patterns in messages and cannot protect integrity\n- **CVE-2022-30320:** Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) uses a protocol with a cryptographically insecure hashing algorithm for passwords.\n- **CVE-2008-3775:** Product uses \"ROT-25\" to obfuscate the password in the registry.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-313: Cleartext Storage in a File or on Disk\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext in a file, or on disk.\n\n### Extended Description\nThe sensitive information could be read by attackers with access to the file, or with physical or administrator access to the raw disk. Even if the information is encoded in a way that is not human-readable, certain techniques could determine which encoding is being used, then decode the information.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-312\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Terminology]** Different people use \"cleartext\" and \"plaintext\" to mean the same thing: the lack of encryption.

Cleartext is any information that is unencrypted, although it might be in an encoded form that is not easily human-readable (such as base64 encoding).\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2001-1481:** Cleartext credentials in world-readable file.\n- **CVE-2005-1828:** Password in cleartext in config file.\n- **CVE-2005-2209:** Password in cleartext in config file.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product allocates a reusable resource or group of resources on behalf of an actor without imposing any restrictions on the size or number of resources that can be allocated, in violation of the intended security policy for that actor.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nCode frequently has to work with limited resources, so programmers must be careful to ensure that resources are not consumed too quickly, or too easily. Without use of quotas, resource limits, or other protection mechanisms, it can be easy for an attacker to consume many resources by rapidly making many requests, or causing larger resources to be used than is needed. When too many resources are allocated, or if a single resource is too large, then it can prevent the code from working correctly, possibly leading to a denial of service.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-400\nChildOf -> CWE-665\nChildOf -> CWE-400\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This entry is different from uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400) in that there are other weaknesses that are related to inability to control resource consumption, such as holding on to a resource too long after use, or not correctly keeping track of active resources so that they can be managed and released when they are finished (CWE-771).\n\n**[Theoretical]** Vulnerability theory is largely about how behaviors and resources interact. \"Resource exhaustion\" can be regarded as either a consequence or an attack, depending on the perspective. This entry is an attempt to reflect one of the underlying weaknesses that enable these attacks (or consequences) to take place.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).\n- **CVE-2009-4017:** Language interpreter does not restrict the number of temporary files being created when handling a MIME request with a large number of parts..\n- **CVE-2009-2726:** Driver does not use a maximum width when invoking sscanf style functions, causing stack consumption.\n\n",

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing the audit logs on an affected system and obtaining credentials that they may not normally have access to. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to use those credentials to discover and manage network devices.\n\n- CVE-2021-24024: A clear text storage of sensitive information into log file vulnerability in FortiADCManager 5.3.0 and below, 5.2.1 and below and FortiADC 5.3.7 and below may allow a remote authenticated attacker to read other local users' password in log files.\n\n- CVE-2021-25284: An issue was discovered in through SaltStack Salt before 3002.5. salt.modules.cmdmod can log credentials to the info or error log level.\n\n- CVE-2021-3032: An information exposure through log file vulnerability exists in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software where configuration secrets for the \u201chttp\u201d, \u201cemail\u201d, and \u201csnmptrap\u201d v3 log forwarding server profiles can be logged to the logrcvr.log system log. Logged information may include up to 1024 bytes of the configuration including the username and password in an encrypted form and private keys used in any certificate profiles set for log forwarding server profiles. This issue impacts: PAN-OS 8.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 8.1.18; PAN-OS 9.0 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.0.12; PAN-OS 9.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.1.4; PAN-OS 10.0 versions earlier than PAN-OS 10.0.1.\n\n- CVE-2021-3036: An information exposure through log file vulnerability exists in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software where secrets in PAN-OS XML API requests are logged in cleartext to the web server logs when the API is used incorrectly. This vulnerability applies only to PAN-OS appliances that are configured to use the PAN-OS XML API and exists only when a client includes a duplicate API parameter in API requests. Logged information includes the cleartext username, password, and API key of the administrator making the PAN-OS XML API request.\n\n- CVE-2021-3037: An information exposure through log file vulnerability exists in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software where the connection details for a scheduled configuration export are logged in system logs. Logged information includes the cleartext username, password, and IP address used to export the PAN-OS configuration to the destination server.\n\n- CVE-2021-32801: Nextcloud server is an open source, self hosted personal cloud. In affected versions logging of exceptions may have resulted in logging potentially sensitive key material for the Nextcloud Encryption-at-Rest functionality. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server is upgraded to 20.0.12, 21.0.4 or 22.1.0. If upgrading is not an option users are advised to disable system logging to resolve this issue until such time that an upgrade can be performed Note that ff you do not use the Encryption-at-Rest functionality of Nextcloud you are not affected by this bug.\n\n- CVE-2021-3425: A flaw was found in the AMQ Broker that discloses JDBC encrypted usernames and passwords when provided in the AMQ Broker application logfile when using the jdbc persistence functionality. Versions shipped in Red Hat AMQ 7 are vulnerable.\n\n- CVE-2021-3791: An information disclosure vulnerability was reported in some Motorola-branded Binatone Hubble Cameras that could allow an unauthenticated attacker on the same subnet to download an encrypted log file containing sensitive information such as WiFi SSID and password.\n\n- CVE-2021-28131: Impala sessions use a 16 byte secret to verify that the session is not being hijacked by another user. However, these secrets appear in the Impala logs, therefore Impala users with access to the logs can use another authenticated user's sessions with specially constructed requests. This means the attacker is able to execute statements for which they don't have the necessary privileges otherwise. Impala deployments with Apache Sentry or Apache Ranger authorization enabled may be vulnerable to privilege escalation if an authenticated attacker is able to hijack a session or query from another authenticated user with privileges not assigned to the attacker. Impala deployments with audit logging enabled may be vulnerable to incorrect audit logging as a user could undertake actions that were logged under the name of a different authenticated user. Constructing an attack requires a high degree of technical sophistication and access to the Impala system as an authenticated user. Mitigation: If an Impala deployment uses Apache Sentry, Apache Ranger or audit logging, then users should upgrade to a version of Impala with the fix for IMPALA-10600. The Impala 4.0 release includes this fix. This hides session secrets from the logs to eliminate the risk of any attack using this mechanism. In lieu of an upgrade, restricting access to logs that expose secrets will reduce the risk of an attack. Restricting access to the Impala deployment to trusted users will also reduce the risk of an attack. Log redaction techniques can be used to redact secrets from the logs.\n\n- CVE-2021-3528: A flaw was found in noobaa-operator in versions before 5.7.0, where internal RPC AuthTokens between the noobaa operator and the noobaa core are leaked into log files.

Successful exploit may cause the information leak.\n\n- CVE-2021-36318: Dell EMC Avamar versions 18.2,19.1,19.2,19.3,19.4 contain a plain-text password storage vulnerability. A high privileged user could potentially exploit this vulnerability, leading to a complete outage.\n\n- CVE-2022-23506: Spinnaker is an open source, multi-cloud continuous delivery platform for releasing software changes, and Spinnaker's Rosco microservice produces machine images. Rosco prior to versions 1.29.2, 1.28.4, and 1.27.3 does not property mask secrets generated via packer builds. This can lead to exposure of sensitive AWS credentials in packer log files. Versions 1.29.2, 1.28.4, and 1.27.3 of Rosco contain fixes for this issue. A workaround is available. It's recommended to use short lived credentials via role assumption and IAM profiles. Additionally, credentials can be set in `/home/spinnaker/.aws/credentials` and `/home/spinnaker/.aws/config` as a volume mount for Rosco pods vs. setting credentials in roscos bake config properties. Last even with those it's recommend to use IAM Roles vs. long lived credentials. This drastically mitigates the risk of credentials exposure. If users have used static credentials, it's recommended to purge any bake logs for AWS, evaluate whether AWS_ACCESS_KEY, SECRET_KEY and/or other sensitive data has been introduced in log files and bake job logs. Then, rotate these credentials and evaluate potential improper use of those credentials.\n\n- CVE-2021-3684: A vulnerability was found in OpenShift Assisted Installer. During generation of the Discovery ISO, image pull secrets were leaked as plaintext in the installation logs. An authenticated user could exploit this by re-using the image pull secret to pull container images from the registry as the associated user.\n\n- CVE-2022-0021: An information exposure through log file vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app on Windows that logs the cleartext credentials of the connecting GlobalProtect user when authenticating using Connect Before Logon feature. This issue impacts GlobalProtect App 5.2 versions earlier than 5.2.9 on Windows. This issue does not affect the GlobalProtect app on other platforms.\n\n- CVE-2022-0652: Confd log files contain local users', including root\u2019s, SHA512crypt password hashes with insecure access permissions. This allows a local attacker to attempt off-line brute-force attacks against these password hashes in Sophos UTM before version 9.710.\n\n- CVE-2022-0718: A flaw was found in python-oslo-utils. Due to improper parsing, passwords with a double quote ( \" ) in them cause incorrect masking in debug logs, causing any part of the password after the double quote to be plaintext.\n\n- CVE-2022-0725: A flaw was found in keepass. The vulnerability occurs due to logging the plain text passwords in system log and leads to an Information Exposure vulnerability. This flaw allows an attacker to interact and read sensitive passwords and logs.\n\n- CVE-2022-20630: A vulnerability in the audit log of Cisco DNA Center could allow an authenticated, local attacker to view sensitive information in clear text. This vulnerability is due to the unsecured logging of sensitive information on an affected system. An attacker with administrative privileges could exploit this vulnerability by accessing the audit logs through the CLI. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to retrieve sensitive information that includes user credentials.\n\n- CVE-2022-33737: The OpenVPN Access Server installer creates a log file readable for everyone, which from version 2.10.0 and before 2.11.0 may contain a random generated admin password\n\n- CVE-2022-34826: In Couchbase Server 7.1.x before 7.1.1, an encrypted Private Key passphrase may be leaked in the logs.\n\n- CVE-2022-20458: The logs of sensitive information (PII) or hardware identifier should only be printed in Android \"userdebug\" or \"eng\" build. StatusBarNotification.getKey() could contain sensitive information. However, CarNotificationListener.java, it prints out the StatusBarNotification.getKey() directly in logs, which could contain user's account name (i.e. PII), in Android \"user\" build.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-12LAndroid ID: A-205567776\n\n- CVE-2022-20651: A vulnerability in the logging component of Cisco Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM) could allow an authenticated, local attacker to view sensitive information in clear text on an affected system. Cisco ADSM must be deployed in a shared workstation environment for this issue to be exploited. This vulnerability is due to the storage of unencrypted credentials in certain logs. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing the logs on an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view the credentials of other users of the shared device.\n\n- CVE-2022-31098: Weave GitOps is a simple open source developer platform for people who want cloud native applications, without needing Kubernetes expertise. A vulnerability in the logging of Weave GitOps could allow an authenticated remote attacker to view sensitive cluster configurations, aka KubeConfg, of registered Kubernetes clusters, including the service account tokens in plain text from Weave GitOps's pod logs on the management cluster. An unauthorized remote attacker can also view these sensitive configurations from external log storage if enabled by the management cluster. This vulnerability is due to the client factory dumping cluster configurations and their service account tokens when the cluster manager tries to connect to an API server of a registered cluster, and a connection error occurs. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by either accessing logs of a pod of Weave GitOps, or from external log storage and obtaining all cluster configurations of registered clusters. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to use those cluster configurations to manage the registered Kubernetes clusters. This vulnerability has been fixed by commit 567356f471353fb5c676c77f5abc2a04631d50ca. Users should upgrade to Weave GitOps core version v0.8.1-rc.6 or newer.

In Keti a user able to create Policy Sets can run arbitrary code by sending malicious Groovy scripts which will escape the configured Groovy sandbox. This vulnerability is known to exist in the latest commit at the time of writing this CVE (commit a1c8dbe). For more details see the referenced GHSL-2021-063.\n\n- CVE-2021-44228: Apache Log4j2 2.0-beta9 through 2.15.0 (excluding security releases 2.12.2, 2.12.3, and 2.3.1) JNDI features used in configuration, log messages, and parameters do not protect against attacker controlled LDAP and other JNDI related endpoints. An attacker who can control log messages or log message parameters can execute arbitrary code loaded from LDAP servers when message lookup substitution is enabled. From log4j 2.15.0, this behavior has been disabled by default. From version 2.16.0 (along with 2.12.2, 2.12.3, and 2.3.1), this functionality has been completely removed.

The GeoTools library has a number of data sources that can perform unchecked JNDI lookups, which in turn can be used to perform class deserialization and result in arbitrary code execution. Similar to the Log4J case, the vulnerability can be triggered if the JNDI names are user-provided, but requires admin-level login to be triggered. The lookups are now restricted in GeoTools 26.4, GeoTools 25.6, and GeoTools 24.6. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that any downstream application should not allow usage of remotely provided JNDI strings.\n\n- CVE-2022-24847: GeoServer is an open source software server written in Java that allows users to share and edit geospatial data. The GeoServer security mechanism can perform an unchecked JNDI lookup, which in turn can be used to perform class deserialization and result in arbitrary code execution. The same can happen while configuring data stores with data sources located in JNDI, or while setting up the disk quota mechanism. In order to perform any of the above changes, the attack needs to have obtained admin rights and use either the GeoServer GUI, or its REST API. The lookups are going to be restricted in GeoServer 2.21.0, 2.20.4, 1.19.6. Users unable to upgrade should restrict access to the `geoserver/web` and `geoserver/rest` via a firewall and ensure that the GeoWebCache is not remotely accessible.\n\n- CVE-2022-26134: In affected versions of Confluence Server and Data Center, an OGNL injection vulnerability exists that would allow an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on a Confluence Server or Data Center instance.

In versions prior to 1.9.0, the default configuration of client side sessions results in unencrypted, but signed, data being set as cookie values. This means that if something sensitive goes into the session, it could be read by something with access to the cookies. For this to be a vulnerability, some kind of sensitive data would need to be stored in the session and the session cookie would have to leak. For example, the cookies are not configured with httpOnly and an adjacent XSS vulnerability within the site allowed capture of the cookies. As of version 1.9.0, a securely randomly generated signing key is used. As a workaround, one may supply an encryption key, as per the documentation recommendation.\n\n- CVE-2021-31855: KDE Messagelib through 5.17.0 reveals cleartext of encrypted messages in some situations. Deleting an attachment of a decrypted encrypted message stored on a remote server (e.g., an IMAP server) causes KMail to upload the decrypted content of the message to the remote server. With a crafted message, a user could be tricked into decrypting an encrypted message and then deleting an attachment attached to this message. If the attacker has access to the messages stored on the email server, then the attacker could read the decrypted content of the encrypted message. This occurs in ViewerPrivate::deleteAttachment in messageviewer/src/viewer/viewer_p.cpp.\n\n- CVE-2021-36165: RICON Industrial Cellular Router S9922L 16.10.3(3794) is affected by cleartext storage of sensitive information and sends username and password as base64.\n\n- CVE-2021-35526: Backup file without encryption vulnerability is found in Hitachi ABB Power Grids System Data Manager \u2013 SDM600 allows attacker to gain access to sensitive information.

When the `reset a forgotten password` feature of XWiki was used, the password was then stored in plain text in database. This only concerns XWiki 13.1RC1 and newer versions. Note that it only concerns the reset password feature available from the \"Forgot your password\" link in the login view: the features allowing a user to change their password, or for an admin to change a user password are not impacted. This vulnerability is particularly dangerous in combination with other vulnerabilities allowing to perform data leak of personal data from users, such as GHSA-599v-w48h-rjrm. Note that this vulnerability only concerns the users of the main wiki: in case of farms, the users registered on subwiki are not impacted thanks to a bug we discovered when investigating this. The problem has been patched in version 14.6RC1, 14.4.3 and 13.10.8. The patch involves a migration of the impacted users as well as the history of the page, to ensure no password remains in plain text in the database. This migration also involves to inform the users about the possible disclosure of their passwords: by default, two emails are automatically sent to the impacted users. A first email to inform about the possibility that their password have been leaked, and a second email using the reset password feature to ask them to set a new password. It's also possible for administrators to set some properties for the migration: it's possible to decide if the user password should be reset (default) or if the passwords should be kept but only hashed. Note that in the first option, the users won't be able to login anymore until they set a new password if they were impacted. Note that in both options, mails will be sent to users to inform them and encourage them to change their passwords.\n\n- CVE-2022-4312:  A cleartext storage of sensitive information vulnerability exists in PcVue versions 8.10 through 15.2.3.

        "matched_text": "CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\n\nType: Class\n\nStatus: Draft\n\nDescription:\n\nThe product uses a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm or protocol.\n\nExtended Details:\n\n\n\nCryptographic algorithms are the methods by which data is scrambled to prevent observation or influence by unauthorized actors. Insecure cryptography can be exploited to expose sensitive information, modify data in unexpected ways, spoof identities of other users or devices, or other impacts.\n\n\nIt is very difficult to produce a secure algorithm, and even high-profile algorithms by accomplished cryptographic experts have been broken. Well-known techniques exist to break or weaken various kinds of cryptography. Accordingly, there are a small number of well-understood and heavily studied algorithms that should be used by most products. Using a non-standard or known-insecure algorithm is dangerous because a determined adversary may be able to break the algorithm and compromise whatever data has been protected.\n\n\nSince the state of cryptography advances so rapidly, it is common for an algorithm to be considered \"unsafe\" even if it was once thought to be strong. This can happen when new attacks are discovered, or if computing power increases so much that the cryptographic algorithm no longer provides the amount of protection that was originally thought.\n\n\nFor a number of reasons, this weakness is even more challenging to manage with hardware deployment of cryptographic algorithms as opposed to software implementation. First, if a flaw is discovered with hardware-implemented cryptography, the flaw cannot be fixed in most cases without a recall of the product, because hardware is not easily replaceable like software. Second, because the hardware product is expected to work for years, the adversary's computing power will only increase over time.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-30273: SCADA-based protocol supports a legacy encryption mode that uses Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA) in ECB mode, which leaks patterns in messages and cannot protect integrity\n\n- CVE-2022-30320: Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) uses a protocol with a cryptographically insecure hashing algorithm for passwords.\n\n- CVE-2008-3775: Product uses \"ROT-25\" to obfuscate the password in the registry.\n\n- CVE-2007-4150: product only uses \"XOR\" to obfuscate sensitive data\n\n- CVE-2007-5460: product only uses \"XOR\" and a fixed key to obfuscate sensitive data\n\n- CVE-2005-4860: Product substitutes characters with other characters in a fixed way, and also leaves certain input characters unchanged.\n\n- CVE-2002-2058: Attackers can infer private IP addresses by dividing each octet by the MD5 hash of '20'.\n\n- CVE-2008-3188: Product uses DES when MD5 has been specified in the configuration, resulting in weaker-than-expected password hashes.\n\n- CVE-2005-2946: Default configuration of product uses MD5 instead of stronger algorithms that are available, simplifying forgery of certificates.\n\n- CVE-2007-6013: Product uses the hash of a hash for authentication, allowing attackers to gain privileges if they can obtain the original hash.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-15128: In OctoberCMS before version 1.0.468, encrypted cookie values were not tied to the name of the cookie the value belonged to. This meant that certain classes of attacks that took advantage of other theoretical vulnerabilities in user facing code (nothing exploitable in the core project itself) had a higher chance of succeeding. Specifically, if your usage exposed a way for users to provide unfiltered user input and have it returned to them as an encrypted cookie (ex. storing a user provided search query in a cookie) they could then use the generated cookie in place of other more tightly controlled cookies; or if your usage exposed the plaintext version of an encrypted cookie at any point to the user they could theoretically provide encrypted content from your application back to it as an encrypted cookie and force the framework to decrypt it for them. Issue has been fixed in build 468 (v1.0.468).\n\n- CVE-2020-4965: IBM Jazz Team Server products use weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms that could allow an attacker to decrypt highly sensitive information.

A remote attacker with read and write access to network data could exploit this vulnerability to display plaintext bits from a block of ciphertext and obtain sensitive information. This issue affects all Juniper Networks SRC Series versions prior to 4.13.0-R6.\n\n- CVE-2021-36298: Dell EMC InsightIQ, versions prior to 4.1.4, contain risky cryptographic algorithms in the SSH component. A remote unauthenticated attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability leading to authentication bypass and remote takeover of the InsightIQ. This allows an attacker to take complete control of InsightIQ to affect services provided by SSH; so Dell recommends customers to upgrade at the earliest opportunity.\n\n- CVE-2021-41263: rails_multisite provides multi-db support for Rails applications. In affected versions this vulnerability impacts any Rails applications using `rails_multisite` alongside Rails' signed/encrypted cookies. Depending on how the application makes use of these cookies, it may be possible for an attacker to re-use cookies on different 'sites' within a multi-site Rails application. The issue has been patched in v4 of the `rails_multisite` gem. Note that this upgrade will invalidate all previous signed/encrypted cookies. The impact of this invalidation will vary based on the application architecture.\n\n- CVE-2021-32001: K3s in SUSE Rancher allows any user with direct access to the datastore, or a copy of a datastore backup, to extract the cluster's confidential keying material (cluster certificate authority private keys, secrets encryption configuration passphrase, etc.) and decrypt it, without having to know the token value. This issue affects: SUSE Rancher K3s version v1.19.12+k3s1, v1.20.8+k3s1, v1.21.2+k3s1 and prior versions; RKE2 version v1.19.12+rke2r1, v1.20.8+rke2r1, v1.21.2+rke2r1 and prior versions.\n\n- CVE-2020-36315: In RELIC before 2020-08-01, RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 signature forgery can occur because certain checks of the padding (and of the first two bytes) are inadequate.

Laravel prior to versions 8.75.0, 7.30.6, and 6.20.42 contain a possible cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Blade templating engine. A broken HTML element may be clicked and the user taken to another location in their browser due to XSS. This is due to the user being able to guess the parent placeholder SHA-1 hash by trying common names of sections. If the parent template contains an exploitable HTML structure an XSS vulnerability can be exposed. This vulnerability has been patched in versions 8.75.0, 7.30.6, and 6.20.42 by determining the parent placeholder at runtime and using a random hash that is unique to each request.\n\n- CVE-2021-31562: The SSL/TLS configuration of Fresenius Kabi Agilia Link + version 3.0 has serious deficiencies that may allow an attacker to compromise SSL/TLS sessions in different ways. An attacker may be able to eavesdrop on transferred data, manipulate data allegedly secured by SSL/TLS, and impersonate an entity to gain access to sensitive information.\n\n- CVE-2021-2351: Vulnerability in the Advanced Networking Option component of Oracle Database Server. Supported versions that are affected are 12.1.0.2, 12.2.0.1 and 19c. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via Oracle Net to compromise Advanced Networking Option. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Advanced Networking Option, attacks may significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in takeover of Advanced Networking Option. Note: The July 2021 Critical Patch Update introduces a number of Native Network Encryption changes to deal with vulnerability CVE-2021-2351 and prevent the use of weaker ciphers.

An attacker that obtained access to the administrative web interface of a printer (e.g., by using the default credentials) can download the address book file, which contains the list of users (domain users, FTP users, etc.) stored on the printer, together with their encrypted passwords. The passwords are protected by a weak cipher, such as ROT13, which requires minimal effort to instantly retrieve the original password, giving the attacker a list of valid domain or FTP usernames and passwords.\n\n- CVE-2021-43989: mySCADA myPRO Versions 8.20.0 and prior stores passwords using MD5, which may allow an attacker to crack the previously retrieved password hashes.\n\n- CVE-2021-45512: Certain NETGEAR devices are affected by weak cryptography. This affects D7000v2 before 1.0.0.62, D8500 before 1.0.3.50, EX3700 before 1.0.0.84, EX3800 before 1.0.0.84, EX6120 before 1.0.0.54, EX6130 before 1.0.0.36, EX7000 before 1.0.1.90, R6250 before 1.0.4.42, R6400v2 before 1.0.4.98, R6700v3 before 1.0.4.98, R6900P before 1.3.2.124, R7000 before 1.0.11.106, R7000P before 1.3.2.124, R7100LG before 1.0.0.56, R7900 before 1.0.4.26, R8000 before 1.0.4.58, R8300 before 1.0.2.134, R8500 before 1.0.2.134, RS400 before 1.5.0.48, WNR3500Lv2 before 1.2.0.62, and XR300 before 1.0.3.50.\n\n- CVE-2021-45696: An issue was discovered in the sha2 crate 0.9.7 before 0.9.8 for Rust. Hashes of long messages may be incorrect when the AVX2-accelerated backend is used.\n\n- CVE-2022-0377: Users of the LearnPress WordPress plugin before 4.1.5 can upload an image as a profile avatar after the registration. After this process the user crops and saves the image. Then a \"POST\" request that contains user supplied name of the image is sent to the server for renaming and cropping of the image. As a result of this request, the name of the user-supplied image is changed with a MD5 value. This process can be conducted only when type of the image is JPG or PNG. An attacker can use this vulnerability in order to rename an arbitrary image file. By doing this, they could destroy the design of the web site.\n\n- CVE-2022-1252: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm in GitHub repository gnuboard/gnuboard5 prior to and including 5.5.5. A vulnerability in gnuboard v5.5.5 and below uses weak encryption algorithms leading to sensitive information exposure. This allows an attacker to derive the email address of any user, including when the 'Let others see my information.' box is ticked off. Or to send emails to any email address, with full control of its contents \n\n- CVE-2022-1434: The OpenSSL 3.0 implementation of the RC4-MD5 ciphersuite incorrectly uses the AAD data as the MAC key. This makes the MAC key trivially predictable. An attacker could exploit this issue by performing a man-in-the-middle attack to modify data being sent from one endpoint to an OpenSSL 3.0 recipient such that the modified data would still pass the MAC integrity check. Note that data sent from an OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint to a non-OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint will always be rejected by the recipient and the connection will fail at that point. Many application protocols require data to be sent from the client to the server first. Therefore, in such a case, only an OpenSSL 3.0 server would be impacted when talking to a non-OpenSSL 3.0 client. If both endpoints are OpenSSL 3.0 then the attacker could modify data being sent in both directions. In this case both clients and servers could be affected, regardless of the application protocol. Note that in the absence of an attacker this bug means that an OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint communicating with a non-OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint will fail to complete the handshake when using this ciphersuite. The confidentiality of data is not impacted by this issue, i.e. an attacker cannot decrypt data that has been encrypted using this ciphersuite - they can only modify it. In order for this attack to work both endpoints must legitimately negotiate the RC4-MD5 ciphersuite. This ciphersuite is not compiled by default in OpenSSL 3.0, and is not available within the default provider or the default ciphersuite list. This ciphersuite will never be used if TLSv1.3 has been negotiated. In order for an OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint to use this ciphersuite the following must have occurred: 1) OpenSSL must have been compiled with the (non-default) compile time option enable-weak-ssl-ciphers 2) OpenSSL must have had the legacy provider explicitly loaded (either through application code or via configuration) 3) The ciphersuite must have been explicitly added to the ciphersuite list 4) The libssl security level must have been set to 0 (default is 1) 5) A version of SSL/TLS below TLSv1.3 must have been negotiated 6) Both endpoints must negotiate the RC4-MD5 ciphersuite in preference to any others that both endpoints have in common Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.3 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1,3.0.2).\n\n- CVE-2022-20805: A vulnerability in the automatic decryption process in Cisco Umbrella Secure Web Gateway (SWG) could allow an authenticated, adjacent attacker to bypass the SSL decryption and content filtering policies on an affected system. This vulnerability is due to how the decryption function uses the TLS Sever Name Indication (SNI) extension of an HTTP request to discover the destination domain and determine if the request needs to be decrypted. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request over TLS from a client to an unknown or controlled URL. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to bypass the decryption process of Cisco Umbrella SWG and allow malicious content to be downloaded to a host on a protected network. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2022-2097: AES OCB mode for 32-bit x86 platforms using the AES-NI assembly optimised implementation will not encrypt the entirety of the data under some circumstances. This could reveal sixteen bytes of data that was preexisting in the memory that wasn't written. In the special case of \"in place\" encryption, sixteen bytes of the plaintext would be revealed. Since OpenSSL does not support OCB based cipher suites for TLS and DTLS, they are both unaffected. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.5 (Affected 3.0.0-3.0.4). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1q (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1p).\n\n- CVE-2022-2781: In affected versions of Octopus Server it was identified that the same encryption process was used for both encrypting session cookies and variables.\n\n- CVE-2022-28164: Brocade SANnav before SANnav 2.2.0 application uses the Blowfish symmetric encryption algorithm for the storage of passwords. This could allow an authenticated attacker to decrypt stored account passwords.\n\n- CVE-2022-28382: An issue was discovered in certain Verbatim drives through 2022-03-31. Due to the use of an insecure encryption AES mode (Electronic Codebook, aka ECB), an attacker may be able to extract information even from encrypted data, for example by observing repeating byte patterns. The firmware of the USB-to-SATA bridge controller INIC-3637EN uses AES-256 with the ECB mode. This operation mode of block ciphers (e.g., AES) always encrypts identical plaintext data, in this case blocks of 16 bytes, to identical ciphertext data. For some data, for instance bitmap images, the lack of the cryptographic property called diffusion, within ECB, can leak sensitive information even in encrypted data. Thus, the use of the ECB operation mode can put the confidentiality of specific information at risk, even in an encrypted form. This affects Keypad Secure USB 3.2 Gen 1 Drive Part Number #49428, Store 'n' Go Secure Portable HDD GD25LK01-3637-C VER4.0, Executive Fingerprint Secure SSD GDMSFE01-INI3637-C VER1.1, and Fingerprint Secure Portable Hard Drive Part Number #53650.\n\n- CVE-2022-29960: Emerson OpenBSI through 2022-04-29 uses weak cryptography. It is an engineering environment for the ControlWave and Bristol Babcock line of RTUs. DES with hardcoded cryptographic keys is used for protection of certain system credentials, engineering files, and sensitive utilities.\n\n- CVE-2022-30320: Saia Burgess Controls (SBC) PCD through 2022-05-06 uses a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm. According to FSCT-2022-0063, there is a Saia Burgess Controls (SBC) PCD S-Bus weak credential hashing scheme issue. The affected components are characterized as: S-Bus (5050/UDP) authentication. The potential impact is: Authentication bypass. The Saia Burgess Controls (SBC) PCD controllers utilize the S-Bus protocol (5050/UDP) for a variety of engineering purposes. It is possible to configure a password in order to restrict access to sensitive engineering functionality. Authentication is done by using the S-Bus 'write byte' message to a specific address and supplying a hashed version of the password. The hashing algorithm used is based on CRC-16 and as such not cryptographically secure. An insecure hashing algorithm is used. An attacker capable of passively observing traffic can intercept the hashed credentials and trivially find collisions allowing for authentication without having to bruteforce a keyspace defined by the actual strength of the password. This allows the attacker access to sensitive engineering functionality such as uploading/downloading control logic and manipulating controller configuration.\n\n- CVE-2022-35513: The Blink1Control2 application <= 2.2.7 uses weak password encryption and an insecure method of storage.\n\n- CVE-2022-38493: Rhonabwy 0.9.99 through 1.1.x before 1.1.7 doesn't check the RSA private key length before RSA-OAEP decryption. This allows attackers to cause a Denial of Service via a crafted JWE (JSON Web Encryption) token.\n\n- CVE-2022-39237: syslabs/sif is the Singularity Image Format (SIF) reference implementation. In versions prior to 2.8.1the `github.com/sylabs/sif/v2/pkg/integrity` package did not verify that the hash algorithm(s) used are cryptographically secure when verifying digital signatures. A patch is available in version >= v2.8.1 of the module. Users are encouraged to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may independently validate that the hash algorithm(s) used for metadata digest(s) and signature hash are cryptographically secure.\n\n- CVE-2022-28166: In Brocade SANnav version before SANN2.2.0.2 and Brocade SANNav before 2.1.1.8, the implementation of TLS/SSL Server Supports the Use of Static Key Ciphers (ssl-static-key-ciphers) on ports 443 & 18082.\n\n- CVE-2022-30187: Azure Storage Library Information Disclosure Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-23839: OpenSSL 1.0.2 supports SSLv2. If a client attempts to negotiate SSLv2 with a server that is configured to support both SSLv2 and more recent SSL and TLS versions then a check is made for a version rollback attack when unpadding an RSA signature. Clients that support SSL or TLS versions greater than SSLv2 are supposed to use a special form of padding. A server that supports greater than SSLv2 is supposed to reject connection attempts from a client where this special form of padding is present, because this indicates that a version rollback has occurred (i.e. both client and server support greater than SSLv2, and yet this is the version that is being requested). The implementation of this padding check inverted the logic so that the connection attempt is accepted if the padding is present, and rejected if it is absent. This means that such as server will accept a connection if a version rollback attack has occurred. Further the server will erroneously reject a connection if a normal SSLv2 connection attempt is made. Only OpenSSL 1.0.2 servers from version 1.0.2s to 1.0.2x are affected by this issue. In order to be vulnerable a 1.0.2 server must: 1) have configured SSLv2 support at compile time (this is off by default), 2) have configured SSLv2 support at runtime (this is off by default), 3) have configured SSLv2 ciphersuites (these are not in the default ciphersuite list) OpenSSL 1.1.1 does not have SSLv2 support and therefore is not vulnerable to this issue. The underlying error is in the implementation of the RSA_padding_check_SSLv23() function. This also affects the RSA_SSLV23_PADDING padding mode used by various other functions. Although 1.1.1 does not support SSLv2 the RSA_padding_check_SSLv23() function still exists, as does the RSA_SSLV23_PADDING padding mode. Applications that directly call that function or use that padding mode will encounter this issue. However since there is no support for the SSLv2 protocol in 1.1.1 this is considered a bug and not a security issue in that version. OpenSSL 1.0.2 is out of support and no longer receiving public updates. Premium support customers of OpenSSL 1.0.2 should upgrade to 1.0.2y. Other users should upgrade to 1.1.1j. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2y (Affected 1.0.2s-1.0.2x).\n\n- CVE-2021-20379: IBM Guardium Data Encryption (GDE) 3.0.0.3 and 4.0.0.4 uses weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms that could allow an attacker to decrypt highly sensitive information. IBM X-Force ID: 195711.\n\n- CVE-2021-20406: IBM Security Verify Information Queue 1.0.6 and 1.0.7 uses weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms that could allow an attacker to decrypt highly sensitive information.

IBM X-Force ID: 197969\n\n- CVE-2021-20566: IBM Resilient SOAR V38.0 uses weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms that could allow an attacker to decrypt highly sensitive information. IBM X-Force ID: 199238.\n\n- CVE-2021-22212: ntpkeygen can generate keys that ntpd fails to parse. NTPsec 1.2.0 allows ntpkeygen to generate keys with '#' characters. ntpd then either pads, shortens the key, or fails to load these keys entirely, depending on the key type and the placement of the '#'. This results in the administrator not being able to use the keys as expected or the keys are shorter than expected and easier to brute-force, possibly resulting in MITM attacks between ntp clients and ntp servers. For short AES128 keys, ntpd generates a warning that it is padding them.\n\n- CVE-2021-22356: There is a weak secure algorithm vulnerability in Huawei products. A weak secure algorithm is used in a module. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by capturing and analyzing the messages between devices to obtain information. This can lead to information leak.Affected product versions include: IPS Module V500R005C00SPC100, V500R005C00SPC200; NGFW Module V500R005C00SPC100, V500R005C00SPC200; Secospace USG6300 V500R001C30SPC200, V500R001C30SPC600, V500R001C60SPC500, V500R005C00SPC100, V500R005C00SPC200; Secospace USG6500 V500R001C30SPC200, V500R001C30SPC600, V500R001C60SPC500, V500R005C00SPC100, V500R005C00SPC200; Secospace USG6600 V500R001C30SPC200, V500R001C30SPC600, V500R001C60SPC500, V500R005C00SPC100, V500R005C00SPC200; USG9500 V500R001C30SPC200, V500R001C30SPC600, V500R001C60SPC500, V500R005C00SPC100, V500R005C00SPC200.\n\n- CVE-2021-22738: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm vulnerability exists in homeLYnk (Wiser For KNX) and spaceLYnk V2.60 and prior that could cause unauthorized access when credentials are discovered after a brute force attack.\n\n- CVE-2021-25763: In JetBrains Ktor before 1.4.2, weak cipher suites were enabled by default.\n\n- CVE-2021-27756: \"TLS-RSA cipher suites are not disabled in BigFix Compliance up to v2.0.5.

Versions 2.2 and earlier for release builds and versions 425 and earlier for nightly builds suffer from use of a weak cryptographic algorithm (RSA/ECB/PKCS1Padding). The issue will be patched in v2.3 for release builds and 426 onwards for nightly builds. As a workaround, one may disable an advance security feature if not required.\n\n- CVE-2021-41278: Functions SDK for EdgeX is meant to provide all the plumbing necessary for developers to get started in processing/transforming/exporting data out of the EdgeX IoT platform. In affected versions broken encryption in app-functions-sdk \u201cAES\u201d transform in EdgeX Foundry releases prior to Jakarta allows attackers to decrypt messages via unspecified vectors. The app-functions-sdk exports an \u201caes\u201d transform that user scripts can optionally call to encrypt data in the processing pipeline. No decrypt function is provided. Encryption is not enabled by default, but if used, the level of protection may be less than the user may expects due to a broken implementation. Version v2.1.0 (EdgeX Foundry Jakarta release and later) of app-functions-sdk-go/v2 deprecates the \u201caes\u201d transform and provides an improved \u201caes256\u201d transform in its place. The broken implementation will remain in a deprecated state until it is removed in the next EdgeX major release to avoid breakage of existing software that depends on the broken implementation. As the broken transform is a library function that is not invoked by default, users who do not use the AES transform in their processing pipelines are unaffected.

Without use of quotas, resource limits, or other protection mechanisms, it can be easy for an attacker to consume many resources by rapidly making many requests, or causing larger resources to be used than is needed. When too many resources are allocated, or if a single resource is too large, then it can prevent the code from working correctly, possibly leading to a denial of service.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-21668: Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).\n\n- CVE-2009-4017: Language interpreter does not restrict the number of temporary files being created when handling a MIME request with a large number of parts..\n\n- CVE-2009-2726: Driver does not use a maximum width when invoking sscanf style functions, causing stack consumption.\n\n- CVE-2009-2540: Large integer value for a length property in an object causes a large amount of memory allocation.\n\n- CVE-2009-2054: Product allows exhaustion of file descriptors when processing a large number of TCP packets.\n\n- CVE-2008-5180: Communication product allows memory consumption with a large number of SIP requests, which cause many sessions to be created.\n\n- CVE-2008-1700: Product allows attackers to cause a denial of service via a large number of directives, each of which opens a separate window.\n\n- CVE-2005-4650: CMS does not restrict the number of searches that can occur simultaneously, leading to resource exhaustion.\n\n- CVE-2020-15100: web application scanner attempts to read an excessively large file created by a user, causing process termination\n\n- CVE-2020-7218: Go-based workload orchestrator does not limit resource usage with unauthenticated connections, allowing a DoS by flooding the service\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-19463: An issue has been found in function vfprintf in PDF2JSON 0.70 that allows attackers to cause a Denial of Service due to a stack overflow.\n\n- CVE-2020-19464: An issue has been found in function XRef::fetch in PDF2JSON 0.70 that allows attackers to cause a Denial of Service due to a stack overflow .\n\n- CVE-2021-29324: OpenSource Moddable v10.5.0 was discovered to contain a stack overflow via the component /moddable/xs/sources/xsScript.c.\n\n- CVE-2021-29329: OpenSource Moddable v10.5.0 was discovered to contain a stack overflow in the fxBinaryExpressionNodeDistribute function at /moddable/xs/sources/xsTree.c.\n\n- CVE-2021-41800: MediaWiki before 1.36.2 allows a denial of service (resource consumption because of lengthy query processing time).

Patch ID: ALPS05403499; Issue ID: ALPS05393787.\n\n- CVE-2021-20185: It was found in Moodle before version 3.10.1, 3.9.4, 3.8.7 and 3.5.16 that messaging did not impose a character limit when sending messages, which could result in client-side (browser) denial of service for users receiving very large messages.\n\n- CVE-2021-29430: Sydent is a reference Matrix identity server. Sydent does not limit the size of requests it receives from HTTP clients. A malicious user could send an HTTP request with a very large body, leading to memory exhaustion and denial of service. Sydent also does not limit response size for requests it makes to remote Matrix homeservers. A malicious homeserver could return a very large response, again leading to memory exhaustion and denial of service. This affects any server which accepts registration requests from untrusted clients. This issue has been patched by releases 89071a1, 0523511, f56eee3. As a workaround request sizes can be limited in an HTTP reverse-proxy. There are no known workarounds for the problem with overlarge responses.\n\n- CVE-2021-29932: An issue was discovered in the parse_duration crate through 2021-03-18 for Rust. It allows attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU and memory consumption) via a duration string with a large exponent.\n\n- CVE-2021-32699: Wings is the control plane software for the open source Pterodactyl game management system. All versions of Pterodactyl Wings prior to `1.4.4` are vulnerable to system resource exhaustion due to improper container process limits being defined. A malicious user can consume more resources than intended and cause downstream impacts to other clients on the same hardware, eventually causing the physical server to stop responding. Users should upgrade to `1.4.4` to mitigate the issue. There is no non-code based workaround for impacted versions of the software. Users running customized versions of this software can manually set a PID limit for containers created.\n\n- CVE-2021-3478: There's a flaw in OpenEXR's scanline input file functionality in versions before 3.0.0-beta. An attacker able to submit a crafted file to be processed by OpenEXR could consume excessive system memory. The greatest impact of this flaw is to system availability.\n\n- CVE-2021-38463: The affected product does not properly control the allocation of resources. A user may be able to allocate unlimited memory buffers using API functions.\n\n- CVE-2021-38465: The webinstaller is a Golang web server executable that enables the generation of an Auvesy image agent. Resource consumption can be achieved by generating large amounts of installations, which are then saved without limitation in the temp folder of the webinstaller executable.\n\n- CVE-2021-3912: OctoRPKI tries to load the entire contents of a repository in memory, and in the case of a GZIP bomb, unzip it in memory, making it possible to create a repository that makes OctoRPKI run out of memory (and thus crash).\n\n- CVE-2021-41546: A vulnerability has been identified in RUGGEDCOM ROX MX5000 (All versions < V2.14.1), RUGGEDCOM ROX RX1400 (All versions < V2.14.1), RUGGEDCOM ROX RX1500 (All versions < V2.14.1), RUGGEDCOM ROX RX1501 (All versions < V2.14.1), RUGGEDCOM ROX RX1510 (All versions < V2.14.1), RUGGEDCOM ROX RX1511 (All versions < V2.14.1), RUGGEDCOM ROX RX1512 (All versions < V2.14.1), RUGGEDCOM ROX RX1524 (All versions < V2.14.1), RUGGEDCOM ROX RX1536 (All versions < V2.14.1), RUGGEDCOM ROX RX5000 (All versions < V2.14.1). Affected devices write crashdumps without checking if enough space is available on the filesystem. Once the crashdump fills the entire root filesystem, affected devices fail to boot successfully. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to cause a permanent Denial-of-Service.\n\n- CVE-2021-21274: Synapse is a Matrix reference homeserver written in python (pypi package matrix-synapse). Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and VoIP. In Synapse before version 1.25.0, a malicious homeserver could redirect requests to their .well-known file to a large file. This can lead to a denial of service attack where homeservers will consume significantly more resources when requesting the .well-known file of a malicious homeserver. This affects any server which accepts federation requests from untrusted servers. Issue is resolved in version 1.25.0. As a workaround the `federation_domain_whitelist` setting can be used to restrict the homeservers communicated with over federation.\n\n- CVE-2021-21294: Http4s (http4s-blaze-server) is a minimal, idiomatic Scala interface for HTTP services. Http4s before versions 0.21.17, 0.22.0-M2, and 1.0.0-M14 have a vulnerability which can lead to a denial-of-service. Blaze-core, a library underlying http4s-blaze-server, accepts connections unboundedly on its selector pool. This has the net effect of amplifying degradation in services that are unable to handle their current request load, since incoming connections are still accepted and added to an unbounded queue. Each connection allocates a socket handle, which drains a scarce OS resource. This can also confound higher level circuit breakers which work based on detecting failed connections. http4s provides a general \"MaxActiveRequests\" middleware mechanism for limiting open connections, but it is enforced inside the Blaze accept loop, after the connection is accepted and the socket opened. Thus, the limit only prevents the number of connections which can be simultaneously processed, not the number of connections which can be held open. In 0.21.17, 0.22.0-M2, and 1.0.0-M14, a new \"maxConnections\" property, with a default value of 1024, has been added to the `BlazeServerBuilder`. Setting the value to a negative number restores unbounded behavior, but is strongly disrecommended. The NIO2 backend does not respect `maxConnections`. Its use is now deprecated in http4s-0.21, and the option is removed altogether starting in http4s-0.22. There are several possible workarounds described in the refrenced GitHub Advisory GHSA-xhv5-w9c5-2r2w.\n\n- CVE-2021-23053: On version 15.1.x before 15.1.3, 14.1.x before 14.1.3.1, and 13.1.x before 13.1.3.6, when the brute force protection feature of BIG-IP Advanced WAF or BIG-IP ASM is enabled on a virtual server and the virtual server is under brute force attack, the MySQL database may run out of disk space due to lack of row limit on undisclosed tables in the MYSQL database. Note: Software versions which have reached End of Technical Support (EoTS) are not evaluated.\n\n- CVE-2021-41167: modern-async is an open source JavaScript tooling library for asynchronous operations using async/await and promises. In affected versions a bug affecting two of the functions in this library: forEachSeries and forEachLimit. They should limit the concurrency of some actions but, in practice, they don't. Any code calling these functions will be written thinking they would limit the concurrency but they won't. This could lead to potential security issues in other projects. The problem has been patched in 1.0.4. There is no workaround.\n\n- CVE-2021-42262: An issue was discovered in Softing OPC UA C++ SDK before 5.70. An invalid XML element in the type dictionary makes the OPC/UA client crash due to an out-of-memory condition.\n\n- CVE-2020-35210: A vulnerability in Atomix v3.1.5 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (DoS) via a Raft session flooding attack using Raft OpenSessionRequest messages.\n\n- CVE-2021-32476: A denial-of-service risk was identified in the draft files area, due to it not respecting user file upload limits. Moodle versions 3.10 to 3.10.3, 3.9 to 3.9.6, 3.8 to 3.8.8, 3.5 to 3.5.17 and earlier unsupported versions are affected.\n\n- CVE-2021-43662: totolink EX300_v2, ver V4.0.3c.140_B20210429 and A720R ,ver V4.1.5cu.470_B20200911 have an issue which causes uncontrolled resource consumption.\n\n- CVE-2020-3566: A vulnerability in the Distance Vector Multicast Routing Protocol (DVMRP) feature of Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to exhaust process memory of an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient queue management for Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted IGMP traffic to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause memory exhaustion, resulting in instability of other processes. These processes may include, but are not limited to, interior and exterior routing protocols. Cisco will release software updates that address this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2020-3569: Multiple vulnerabilities in the Distance Vector Multicast Routing Protocol (DVMRP) feature of Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to either immediately crash the Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) process or make it consume available memory and eventually crash. The memory consumption may negatively impact other processes that are running on the device. These vulnerabilities are due to the incorrect handling of IGMP packets. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending crafted IGMP traffic to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to immediately crash the IGMP process or cause memory exhaustion, resulting in other processes becoming unstable. These processes may include, but are not limited to, interior and exterior routing protocols. Cisco will release software updates that address these vulnerabilities.\n\n- CVE-2021-44988: Jerryscript v3.0.0 and below was discovered to contain a stack overflow via ecma_find_named_property in ecma-helpers.c.\n\n- CVE-2021-46050: A Stack Overflow vulnerability exists in Binaryen 103 via the printf_common function.\n\n- CVE-2022-29503: A memory corruption vulnerability exists in the libpthread linuxthreads functionality of uClibC 0.9.33.2 and uClibC-ng 1.0.40. Thread allocation can lead to memory corruption. An attacker can create threads to trigger this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2022-35107: SWFTools commit 772e55a2 was discovered to contain a stack overflow via vfprintf at /stdio-common/vfprintf.c.\n\n- CVE-2022-35111: SWFTools commit 772e55a2 was discovered to contain a stack overflow via __sanitizer::StackDepotNode::hash(__sanitizer::StackTrace const&) at /sanitizer_common/sanitizer_stackdepot.cpp.\n\n- CVE-2022-21716: Twisted is an event-based framework for internet applications, supporting Python 3.6+. Prior to 22.2.0, Twisted SSH client and server implement is able to accept an infinite amount of data for the peer's SSH version identifier. This ends up with a buffer using all the available memory. The attach is a simple as `nc -rv localhost 22 < /dev/zero`. A patch is available in version 22.2.0. There are currently no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-41288: A vulnerability has been identified in JT2Go (All versions < V14.1.0.6), Teamcenter Visualization V13.2 (All versions < V13.2.0.12), Teamcenter Visualization V13.3 (All versions < V13.3.0.8), Teamcenter Visualization V14.0 (All versions < V14.0.0.4), Teamcenter Visualization V14.1 (All versions < V14.1.0.6). The CGM_NIST_Loader.dll contains stack exhaustion vulnerability when parsing a CGM file. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to crash the application causing denial of service condition.\n\n- CVE-2022-32559: An issue was discovered in Couchbase Server before 7.0.4. Random HTTP requests lead to leaked metrics.\n\n- CVE-2022-3273: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling in GitHub repository ikus060/rdiffweb prior to 2.5.0a4.\n\n- CVE-2021-3669: A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. Measuring usage of the shared memory does not scale with large shared memory segment counts which could lead to resource exhaustion and DoS.\n\n- CVE-2021-3759: A memory overflow vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel\u2019s ipc functionality of the memcg subsystem, in the way a user calls the semget function multiple times, creating semaphores. This flaw allows a local user to starve the resources, causing a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.\n\n- CVE-2022-1708: A vulnerability was found in CRI-O that causes memory or disk space exhaustion on the node for anyone with access to the Kube API. The ExecSync request runs commands in a container and logs the output of the command. This output is then read by CRI-O after command execution, and it is read in a manner where the entire file corresponding to the output of the command is read in. Thus, if the output of the command is large it is possible to exhaust the memory or the disk space of the node when CRI-O reads the output of the command. The highest threat from this vulnerability is system availability.\n\n- CVE-2022-20143: In addAutomaticZenRule of ZenModeHelper.java, there is a possible permanent denial of service due to resource exhaustion. This could lead to local denial of service with User execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-10 Android-11 Android-12 Android-12LAndroid ID: A-220735360\n\n- CVE-2022-20478: In NotificationChannel of NotificationChannel.java, there is a possible failure to persist permissions settings due to resource exhaustion.

This issue affects: SUSE Manager Server 4.1 spacewalk-java versions prior to 4.1.46. SUSE Manager Server 4.2 spacewalk-java versions prior to 4.2.37. \n\n- CVE-2022-23487: js-libp2p is the official javascript Implementation of libp2p networking stack. Versions older than `v0.38.0` of js-libp2p are vulnerable to targeted resource exhaustion attacks. These attacks target libp2p\u2019s connection, stream, peer, and memory management. An attacker can cause the allocation of large amounts of memory, ultimately leading to the process getting killed by the host\u2019s operating system. While a connection manager tasked with keeping the number of connections within manageable limits has been part of js-libp2p, this component was designed to handle the regular churn of peers, not a targeted resource exhaustion attack. Users are advised to update their js-libp2p dependency to `v0.38.0` or greater. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2022-23492: go-libp2p is the offical libp2p implementation in the Go programming language. Version `0.18.0` and older of go-libp2p are vulnerable to targeted resource exhaustion attacks. These attacks target libp2p\u2019s connection, stream, peer, and memory management. An attacker can cause the allocation of large amounts of memory, ultimately leading to the process getting killed by the host\u2019s operating system. While a connection manager tasked with keeping the number of connections within manageable limits has been part of go-libp2p, this component was designed to handle the regular churn of peers, not a targeted resource exhaustion attack. Users are advised to upgrade their version of go-libp2p to version `0.18.1` or newer. Users unable to upgrade may consult the denial of service (dos) mitigation page for more information on how to incorporate mitigation strategies, monitor your application, and respond to attacks.\n\n- CVE-2022-23913: In Apache ActiveMQ Artemis prior to 2.20.0 or 2.19.1, an attacker could partially disrupt availability (DoS) through uncontrolled resource consumption of memory.\n\n- CVE-2022-2406: The legacy Slack import feature in Mattermost version 6.7.0 and earlier fails to properly limit the sizes of imported files, which allows an authenticated attacker to crash the server by importing large files via the Slack import REST API.\n\n- CVE-2022-28871: A Denial-of-Service (DoS) vulnerability was discovered in F-Secure Atlant whereby the fsicapd component used in certain F-Secure products while scanning larger packages/fuzzed files consume too much memory eventually can crash the scanning engine. The exploit can be triggered remotely by an attacker.\n\n- CVE-2022-31075: KubeEdge is an open source system for extending native containerized application orchestration capabilities to hosts at Edge. Prior to versions 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4, EdgeCore may be susceptible to a DoS attack on CloudHub if an attacker was to send a well-crafted HTTP request to `/edge.crt`. If an attacker can send a well-crafted HTTP request to CloudHub, and that request has a very large body, that request can crash the HTTP service through a memory exhaustion vector. The request body is being read into memory, and a body that is larger than the available memory can lead to a successful attack. Because the request would have to make it through authorization, only authorized users may perform this attack. The consequence of the exhaustion is that CloudHub will be in denial of service. KubeEdge is affected only when users enable the CloudHub module in the file `cloudcore.yaml`. This bug has been fixed in Kubeedge 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4. As a workaround, disable the CloudHub switch in the config file `cloudcore.yaml`.\n\n- CVE-2022-31078: KubeEdge is an open source system for extending native containerized application orchestration capabilities to hosts at Edge. Prior to versions 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4, the CloudCore Router does not impose a limit on the size of responses to requests made by the REST handler. An attacker could use this weakness to make a request that will return an HTTP response with a large body and cause DoS of CloudCore. In the HTTP Handler API, the rest handler makes a request to a pre-specified handle. The handle will return an HTTP response that is then read into memory. The consequence of the exhaustion is that CloudCore will be in a denial of service. Only an authenticated user of the cloud can make an attack. It will be affected only when users enable `router` module in the config file `cloudcore.yaml`. This bug has been fixed in Kubeedge 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4. As a workaround, disable the router switch in the config file `cloudcore.yaml`.\n\n- CVE-2022-31079: KubeEdge is an open source system for extending native containerized application orchestration capabilities to hosts at Edge. Prior to versions 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4, the Cloud Stream server and the Edge Stream server reads the entire message into memory without imposing a limit on the size of this message. An attacker can exploit this by sending a large message to exhaust memory and cause a DoS. The Cloud Stream server and the Edge Stream server are under DoS attack in this case. The consequence of the exhaustion is that the CloudCore and EdgeCore will be in a denial of service. Only an authenticated user can cause this issue. It will be affected only when users enable `cloudStream` module in the config file `cloudcore.yaml` and enable `edgeStream` module in the config file `edgecore.yaml`. This bug has been fixed in Kubeedge 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4. As a workaround, disable cloudStream module in the config file `cloudcore.yaml` and disable edgeStream module in the config file `edgecore.yaml`.\n\n- CVE-2022-3147: Mattermost version 7.0.x and earlier fails to sufficiently limit the in-memory sizes of concurrently uploaded JPEG images, which allows authenticated users to cause resource exhaustion on specific system configurations, resulting in server-side Denial of Service.\n\n- CVE-2022-33749: XAPI open file limit DoS It is possible for an unauthenticated client on the network to cause XAPI to hit its file-descriptor limit. This causes XAPI to be unable to accept new requests for other (trusted) clients, and blocks XAPI from carrying out any tasks that require the opening of file descriptors.\n\n- CVE-2022-3423: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling in GitHub repository nocodb/nocodb prior to 0.92.0. \n\n- CVE-2022-35915: OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for secure smart contract development. The target contract of an EIP-165 `supportsInterface` query can cause unbounded gas consumption by returning a lot of data, while it is generally assumed that this operation has a bounded cost. The issue has been fixed in v4.7.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-41932: XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. It's possible to make XWiki create many new schemas and fill them with tables just by using a crafted user identifier in the login form. This may lead to degraded database performance. The problem has been patched in XWiki 13.10.8, 14.6RC1 and 14.4.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-2134: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling in GitHub repository inventree/inventree prior to 0.8.0.\n\n- CVE-2022-43686: In Concrete CMS (formerly concrete5) below 8.5.10 and between 9.0.0 and 9.1.2, the authTypeConcreteCookieMap table can be filled up causing a denial of service (high load).\n\n- CVE-2022-41725: A denial of service is possible from excessive resource consumption in net/http and mime/multipart. Multipart form parsing with mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm can consume largely unlimited amounts of memory and disk files. This also affects form parsing in the net/http package with the Request methods FormFile, FormValue, ParseMultipartForm, and PostFormValue. ReadForm takes a maxMemory parameter, and is documented as storing \"up to maxMemory bytes +10MB (reserved for non-file parts) in memory\". File parts which cannot be stored in memory are stored on disk in temporary files. The unconfigurable 10MB reserved for non-file parts is excessively large and can potentially open a denial of service vector on its own. However, ReadForm did not properly account for all memory consumed by a parsed form, such as map entry overhead, part names, and MIME headers, permitting a maliciously crafted form to consume well over 10MB. In addition, ReadForm contained no limit on the number of disk files created, permitting a relatively small request body to create a large number of disk temporary files. With fix, ReadForm now properly accounts for various forms of memory overhead, and should now stay within its documented limit of 10MB + maxMemory bytes of memory consumption. Users should still be aware that this limit is high and may still be hazardous. In addition, ReadForm now creates at most one on-disk temporary file, combining multiple form parts into a single temporary file. The mime/multipart.File interface type's documentation states, \"If stored on disk, the File's underlying concrete type will be an *os.File.\". This is no longer the case when a form contains more than one file part, due to this coalescing of parts into a single file. The previous behavior of using distinct files for each form part may be reenabled with the environment variable GODEBUG=multipartfiles=distinct. Users should be aware that multipart.ReadForm and the http.Request methods that call it do not limit the amount of disk consumed by temporary files. Callers can limit the size of form data with http.MaxBytesReader.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-400 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-665 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-400 (ChildOf)",

However, when these credentials are easily predictable or even fixed (as with default or hard-coded passwords and keys), then the attacker can defeat the mechanism without relying on brute force.\n\n\nCredentials may be weak for different reasons, such as:\n\n\n  - Hard-coded (i.e., static and unchangeable by the administrator)\n\n  - Default (i.e., the same static value across different deployments/installations, but able to be changed by the administrator)\n\n  - Predictable (i.e., generated in a way that produces unique credentials across deployments/installations, but can still be guessed with reasonable efficiency)\n\nEven if a new, unique credential is intended to be generated for each product installation, if the generation is predictable, then that may also simplify guessing attacks.\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- [REF-1374]: Chain: JavaScript-based cryptocurrency library can fall back to the insecure Math.random() function instead of reporting a failure (CWE-392), thus reducing the entropy (CWE-332) and leading to generation of non-unique cryptographic keys for Bitcoin wallets (CWE-1391)\n\n- CVE-2022-30270: Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) uses default credentials for some SSH accounts\n\n- CVE-2022-29965: Distributed Control System (DCS) uses a deterministic algorithm to generate utility passwords\n\n- CVE-2022-30271: Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) uses a hard-coded SSH private key that is likely to be used in typical deployments\n\n- CVE-2021-38759: microcontroller board has default password, allowing admin access\n\n- CVE-2021-41192: data visualization/sharing package uses default secret keys or cookie values if they are not specified in environment variables\n\n- CVE-2020-8994: UART interface for AI speaker uses empty password for root shell\n\n- CVE-2020-27020: password manager does not generate cryptographically strong passwords, allowing prediction of passwords using guessable details such as time of generation\n\n- CVE-2020-8632: password generator for cloud application has small length value, making it easier for brute-force guessing\n\n- CVE-2020-5365: network-attached storage (NAS) system has predictable default passwords for a diagnostics/support account\n\n- CVE-2020-5248: IT asset management app has a default encryption key that is the same across installations\n\n- CVE-2018-3825: cloud cluster management product has a default master encryption key\n\n- CVE-2012-3503: Installation script has a hard-coded secret token value, allowing attackers to bypass authentication\n\n- CVE-2010-2306: Intrusion Detection System (IDS) uses the same static, private SSL keys for multiple devices and installations, allowing decryption of SSL traffic\n\n- CVE-2001-0618: Residential gateway uses the last 5 digits of the 'Network Name' or SSID as the default WEP key, which allows attackers to get the key by sniffing the SSID, which is sent in the clear\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-3875: A vulnerability classified as critical was found in Click Studios Passwordstate and Passwordstate Browser Extension Chrome. This vulnerability affects unknown code of the component API. The manipulation leads to authentication bypass by assumed-immutable data. The attack can be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component. The identifier of this vulnerability is VDB-216244.\n\n- CVE-2021-3979: A key length flaw was found in Red Hat Ceph Storage. An attacker can exploit the fact that the key length is incorrectly passed in an encryption algorithm to create a non random key, which is weaker and can be exploited for loss of confidentiality and integrity on encrypted disks.\n\n- CVE-2021-42949: The component controlla_login function in HotelDruid Hotel Management Software v3.0.3 generates a predictable session token, allowing attackers to bypass authentication via bruteforce attacks.\n\n- CVE-2022-23555: authentik is an open-source Identity Provider focused on flexibility and versatility. Versions prior to 2022.11.4 and 2022.10.4 are vulnerable to Improper Authentication. Token reuse in invitation URLs leads to access control bypass via the use of a different enrollment flow than in the one provided. The vulnerability allows an attacker that knows different invitation flows names (e.g. `enrollment-invitation-test` and `enrollment-invitation-admin`) via either different invite links or via brute forcing to signup via a single invitation url for any valid invite link received (it can even be a url for a third flow as long as it's a valid invite) as the token used in the `Invitations` section of the Admin interface does NOT change when a different `enrollment flow` is selected via the interface and it is NOT bound to the selected flow, so it will be valid for any flow when used. This issue is patched in authentik 2022.11.4,2022.10.4 and 2022.12.0. Only configurations that use invitations and have multiple enrollment flows with invitation stages that grant different permissions are affected. The default configuration is not vulnerable, and neither are configurations with a single enrollment flow. As a workaround, fixed data can be added to invitations which can be checked in the flow to deny requests. Alternatively, an identifier with high entropy (like a UUID) can be used as flow slug, mitigating the attack vector by exponentially decreasing the possibility of discovering other flows.\n\n- CVE-2022-28376: Verizon 5G Home LVSKIHP outside devices through 2022-02-15 allow anyone (knowing the device's serial number) to access a CPE admin website, e.g., at the 10.0.0.1 IP address. The password (for the verizon username) is calculated by concatenating the serial number and the model (i.e., the LVSKIHP string), running the sha256sum program, and extracting the first seven characters concatenated with the last seven characters of that SHA-256 value.\n\n- CVE-2022-34919: The file upload wizard in Zengenti Contensis Classic before 15.2.1.79 does not correctly check that a user has authenticated. By uploading a crafted aspx file, it is possible to execute arbitrary commands.\n\n- CVE-2022-40494: NPS before v0.26.10 was discovered to contain an authentication bypass vulnerability via constantly generating and sending the Auth key and Timestamp parameters.\n\n- CVE-2021-41506: Xiaongmai AHB7008T-MH-V2, AHB7804R-ELS, AHB7804R-MH-V2, AHB7808R-MS-V2, AHB7808R-MS, AHB7808T-MS-V2, AHB7804R-LMS, HI3518_50H10L_S39 V4.02.R11.7601.Nat.Onvif.20170420, V4.02.R11.Nat.Onvif.20160422, V4.02.R11.7601.Nat.Onvif.20170424, V4.02.R11.Nat.Onvif.20170327, V4.02.R11.Nat.Onvif.20161205, V4.02.R11.Nat.20170301, V4.02.R12.Nat.OnvifS.20170727 is affected by a backdoor in the macGuarder and dvrHelper binaries of DVR/NVR/IP camera firmware due to static root account credentials in the system.\n\n- CVE-2022-43917:  IBM WebSphere Application Server 8.5 and 9.0 traditional container uses weaker than expected cryptographic keys that could allow an attacker to decrypt sensitive information. This affects only the containerized version of WebSphere Application Server traditional. IBM X-Force ID: 241045. \n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-1390 (ChildOf)",

        "matched_text": "CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\n\nType: Base\n\nStatus: Draft\n\nDescription:\n\nTo fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non-standard, unproven, or disallowed/non-compliant cryptographic implementation.\n\nExtended Details:\n\n\n\nCryptographic protocols and systems depend on cryptographic primitives (and associated algorithms) as their basic building blocks. Some common examples of primitives are digital signatures, one-way hash functions, ciphers, and public key cryptography; however, the notion of \"primitive\" can vary depending on point of view. See \"Terminology Notes\" for further explanation of some concepts.\n\n\nCryptographic primitives are defined to accomplish one very specific task in a precisely defined and mathematically reliable fashion. For example, suppose that for a specific cryptographic primitive (such as an encryption routine), the consensus is that the primitive can only be broken after trying out N different inputs (where the larger the value of N, the stronger the cryptography). For an encryption scheme like AES-256, one would expect N to be so large as to be infeasible to execute in a reasonable amount of time.\n\n\nIf a vulnerability is ever found that shows that one can break a cryptographic primitive in significantly less than the expected number of attempts, then that primitive is considered weakened (or sometimes in extreme cases, colloquially it is \"broken\"). As a result, anything using this cryptographic primitive would now be considered insecure or risky. Thus, even breaking or weakening a seemingly small cryptographic primitive has the potential to render the whole system vulnerable, due to its reliance on the primitive. A historical example can be found in TLS when using DES. One would colloquially call DES the cryptographic primitive for transport encryption in this version of TLS. In the past, DES was considered strong, because no weaknesses were found in it; importantly, DES has a key length of 56 bits. Trying N=2^56 keys was considered impractical for most actors. Unfortunately, attacking a system with 56-bit keys is now practical via brute force, which makes defeating DES encryption practical. It is now practical for an adversary to read any information sent under this version of TLS and use this information to attack the system. As a result, it can be claimed that this use of TLS is weak, and that any system depending on TLS with DES could potentially render the entire system vulnerable to attack.\n\n\nCryptographic primitives and associated algorithms are only considered safe after extensive research and review from experienced cryptographers from academia, industry, and government entities looking for any possible flaws. Furthermore, cryptographic primitives and associated algorithms are frequently reevaluated for safety when new mathematical and attack techniques are discovered. As a result and over time, even well-known cryptographic primitives can lose their compliance status with the discovery of novel attacks that might either defeat the algorithm or reduce its robustness significantly.\n\n\nIf ad-hoc cryptographic primitives are implemented, it is almost certain that the implementation will be vulnerable to attacks that are well understood by cryptographers, resulting in the exposure of sensitive information and other consequences.\n\n\nThis weakness is even more difficult to manage for hardware-implemented deployment of cryptographic algorithms. First, because hardware is not patchable as easily as software, any flaw discovered after release and production typically cannot be fixed without a recall of the product. Secondly, the hardware product is often expected to work for years, during which time computation power available to the attacker only increases. Therefore, for hardware implementations of cryptographic primitives, it is absolutely essential that only strong, proven cryptographic primitives are used.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-4778: software uses MD5, which is less safe than the default SHA-256 used by related products\n\n- CVE-2005-2946: Default configuration of product uses MD5 instead of stronger algorithms that are available, simplifying forgery of certificates.\n\n- CVE-2019-3907: identity card uses MD5 hash of a salt and password\n\n- CVE-2021-34687: personal key is transmitted over the network using a substitution cipher\n\n- CVE-2020-14254: product does not disable TLS-RSA cipher suites, allowing decryption of traffic if TLS 2.0 and secure ciphers are not enabled.\n\n- CVE-2019-1543: SSL/TLS library generates 16-byte nonces but reduces them to 12 byte nonces for the ChaCha20-Poly1305 cipher, converting them in a way that violates the cipher's requirements for unique nonces.\n\n- CVE-2017-9267: LDAP interface allows use of weak ciphers\n\n- CVE-2017-7971: SCADA product allows \"use of outdated cipher suites\"\n\n- CVE-2020-6616: Chip implementing Bluetooth uses a low-entropy PRNG instead of a hardware RNG, allowing spoofing.\n\n- CVE-2019-1715: security product has insufficient entropy in the DRBG, allowing collisions and private key discovery\n\n- CVE-2014-4192: Dual_EC_DRBG implementation in RSA toolkit does not correctly handle certain byte requests, simplifying plaintext recovery\n\n- CVE-2007-6755: Recommendation for Dual_EC_DRBG algorithm contains point Q constants that could simplify decryption\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-34687: iDrive RemotePC before 7.6.48 on Windows allows information disclosure. A man in the middle can recover a system's Personal Key when a client attempts to make a LAN connection. The Personal Key is transmitted over the network while only being encrypted via a substitution cipher.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-327 (ChildOf)",

Insecure cryptography can be exploited to expose sensitive information, modify data in unexpected ways, spoof identities of other users or devices, or other impacts.\n\n\nIt is very difficult to produce a secure algorithm, and even high-profile algorithms by accomplished cryptographic experts have been broken. Well-known techniques exist to break or weaken various kinds of cryptography. Accordingly, there are a small number of well-understood and heavily studied algorithms that should be used by most products. Using a non-standard or known-insecure algorithm is dangerous because a determined adversary may be able to break the algorithm and compromise whatever data has been protected.\n\n\nSince the state of cryptography advances so rapidly, it is common for an algorithm to be considered \"unsafe\" even if it was once thought to be strong. This can happen when new attacks are discovered, or if computing power increases so much that the cryptographic algorithm no longer provides the amount of protection that was originally thought.\n\n\nFor a number of reasons, this weakness is even more challenging to manage with hardware deployment of cryptographic algorithms as opposed to software implementation. First, if a flaw is discovered with hardware-implemented cryptography, the flaw cannot be fixed in most cases without a recall of the product, because hardware is not easily replaceable like software. Second, because the hardware product is expected to work for years, the adversary's computing power will only increase over time.\n",
