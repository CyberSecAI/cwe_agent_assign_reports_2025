# Raw Analyzer Response for CVE-2025-46497

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-352 | Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) | 0.9 | Compound | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-79 | Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') | 0.8 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is the **lack of CSRF protection**, which allows for a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack. The CSRF attack then leads to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), because the attacker can force a privileged user to perform actions that inject malicious scripts. CWE-352 [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)] can lead to other weaknesses, including CWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')].

## Vulnerability Chain
1.  **Root Cause:** **Lack of CSRF protection** (CWE-352) allows an unauthenticated attacker to forge requests.
2.  **Weakness:** The forged requests lead to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (CWE-79) due to **improper neutralization of input**.
3.  **Impact:** Malicious scripts are stored and executed in the context of other users.

## Summary of Analysis
The vulnerability description explicitly mentions "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability" and that this leads to "Stored XSS". The root cause is the **lack of CSRF protection**, which directly corresponds to CWE-352 [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)]. The resulting Stored XSS is a consequence of the **lack of CSRF protection**, and it corresponds to CWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')].

The retriever results also suggest CWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')] and CWE-352 [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)] as relevant CWEs. CWE-79 is a Base level weakness, while CWE-352 is a Compound weakness. The vulnerability is a combination of both weaknesses, making it a complex vulnerability.

I considered other CWEs from the retriever results, such as CWE-434 [Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type], CWE-89 [Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')], and CWE-918 [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)], but these are not directly related to the vulnerability description. They were not selected because they don't align with the described vulnerability involving CSRF leading to XSS.

The chosen CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-352 [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)] describes the **lack of CSRF protection**, and CWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')] describes the resulting Stored XSS due to **improper neutralization of input**.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as "<", ">", and "&" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
**Abstraction Level**: Compound
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.

## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web server receives a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.

## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-941: Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product creates a communication channel to initiate an outgoing request to an actor, but it does not correctly specify the intended destination for that actor.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to
