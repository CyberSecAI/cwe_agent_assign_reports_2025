  "query": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved tracing Fix overflow in get_free_elt() tracing_map->next_elt in get_free_elt() is at risk of overflowing. Once it overflows, new elements can still be inserted into the tracing_map even though the maximum number of elements (`max_elts`) has been reached. Continuing to insert elements after the overflow could result in the tracing_map containing tracing_map->max_size elements, leaving no empty entries. If any attempt is made to insert an element into a full tracing_map using `__tracing_map_insert()`, it will cause an infinite loop with preemption disabled, leading to a CPU hang problem. Fix this by preventing any further increments to tracing_map->next_elt once it reaches tracing_map->max_elt.",
