  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved tracing **Fix overflow in get_free_elt() tracing_map->next_elt in get_free_elt() is at risk of overflowing**. Once it overflows, new elements can still be inserted into the tracing_map even though the maximum number of elements (`max_elts`) has been reached. Continuing to insert elements after the overflow could result in the tracing_map containing tracing_map->max_size elements, leaving no empty entries. If any attempt is made to insert an element into a full tracing_map using `__tracing_map_insert()`, it will cause an infinite loop with preemption disabled, leading to a CPU hang problem. Fix this by preventing any further increments to tracing_map->next_elt once it reaches tracing_map->max_elt.",

  "reference_content": "The provided content is related to CVE-2024-43890.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe `tracing_map->next_elt` variable in the `get_free_elt()` function of the Linux kernel tracing subsystem is at risk of overflowing.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- Integer overflow: The atomic increment of `tracing_map->next_elt` was not properly checked against the maximum number of elements (`max_elts`). This allowed `next_elt` to wrap around to 0 after reaching the maximum value.\n- Infinite Loop: If new elements were inserted into the tracing map after the overflow, the map would reach its maximum size (`tracing_map->max_size`), leaving no free entries. Subsequent attempts to insert elements into a full map using `__tracing_map_insert()` would result in an infinite loop with preemption disabled.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\nA successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a denial of service condition, resulting in a CPU hang.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- The vulnerability can be triggered by continuously inserting elements into the tracing map until it overflows.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- The attacker would need to be able to trigger the insertion of a sufficient number of elements into the tracing map to cause the overflow. This likely requires some form of privileged access to interact with the kernel tracing interface.\n\n**Technical Details:**\nThe fix replaces `atomic_inc_return` with `atomic_fetch_add_unless`. This prevents any further increments to `tracing_map->next_elt` when it equals `tracing_map->max_elts`. Additionally, `atomic_set(&map->next_elt, -1);` was changed to `atomic_set(&map->next_elt, 0);` when the tracing map is cleared or created.",
