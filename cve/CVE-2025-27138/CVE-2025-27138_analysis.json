  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-27138 based on provided content:\n\nBoth provided content snippets relate to CVE-2025-27138. Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information extracted from the content:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from how `io.dataease.auth.filter.TokenFilter` handles request URLs. It uses `request.getRequestURI` to obtain the URL and passes it to `WhitelistUtils.match` to determine if authentication is required.  The `WhitelistUtils.match` method's string filtering (invalidUrl method) is insufficient, especially when `server.servlet.context-path` is configured.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **Improper Authentication:** The authentication mechanism is flawed, allowing potential unauthorized access.\n*   **Path Traversal/Bypass:** The vulnerability can be bypassed by crafting a URL with a specific prefix (`/geo/%2e%2e/`) that exploits the context path configuration.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nUnauthorized access to the application.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Crafting a malicious URL with the `/geo/%2e%2e/` prefix, combined with the configured `server.servlet.context-path`.  For example, if `server.servlet.context-path` is set to `/demo`, the attacker would use a URL like `http://127.0.0.1:8100/demo/de2api/user/info` and then `http://127.0.0.1:8100/geo/%2e%2e/demo/de2api/user/info`.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   The attacker needs to be able to construct and send HTTP requests to the application.\n*   Knowledge of the `server.servlet.context-path` configuration is helpful.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   Upgrade to version 2.10.6 or later, which contains the fix for this vulnerability.\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   The content provides a detailed reproduction scenario, including the configuration of `server.servlet.context-path` and example URLs.\n*   It explains the specific bypass technique using the `../` sequence in the URL.\n*   It identifies the relevant classes involved: `io.dataease.auth.filter.TokenFilter` and `WhitelistUtils`.\n*   The content also provides information about the project's technology stack (Vue.js, Spring Boot, MySQL, etc.).",

This is a Class-level CWE, and there may be more specific Base or Variant level CWEs. The vulnerability description suggests the authentication mechanism is flawed, leading to unauthorized access. CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) is related but less specific, as it suggests an authorization check exists but is performed incorrectly. CWE-22 (Path Traversal) is considered as a secondary weakness because the **vulnerability can be bypassed by crafting a URL with a specific prefix** (`/geo/%2e%2e/`) that exploits the context path configuration.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\"]\n    \n    cwe863 -->|PEEROF| cwe287\n    cwe22 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe287\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n\n    class cwe287 primary\n    class cwe863 secondary\n    class cwe22 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **flawed authentication** mechanism (CWE-287), possibly due to **insufficient validation** of the request URL by the `TokenFilter` class. This leads to a **bypass of authentication** and potential **unauthorized access**. An attacker can exploit the context path configuration and crafted URL, which leads to **Path Traversal** (CWE-22).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified several potential CWEs, including authentication and authorization-related weaknesses. Based on the provided evidence, especially the description of the **flaw in the authentication** in the `TokenFilter` class and the ability to bypass authentication using a crafted URL, CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) is chosen as the primary CWE. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this by stating \"**Improper Authentication:** The authentication mechanism is flawed, allowing potential unauthorized access.\" While CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) and CWE-22 (Path Traversal) are also considered, they are deemed secondary to the primary authentication flaw. The selection of CWE-287 is at the Class level, as there isn't enough information to pinpoint a more specific Base-level CWE related to the authentication **weakness**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
