This leads to a secondary weakness, CWE-863, as the exposed token allows unauthorized access to resources.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe201 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe863\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe201 primary\n    class cwe863 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **CWE-201** (**root cause**), where the API token is leaked in the web UI. This allows any registered user to obtain the token with all privileges, leading to **CWE-863**, where the **incorrect authorization** occurs because the obtained token grants access to resources that the user should not have.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, mainly the CVE Reference Links Content Summary. The **root cause** is the leakage of the REST API key, which translates to **CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data)**. The consequence is that an authorized user can obtain an API token with all privileges. Because of the ability to make use of an access token for materials for scopes which it should not be accepted, **CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization)** is appropriate.\n\nI considered **CWE-269 (Improper Privilege Management)** since it was explicitly mentioned in the CVE Reference Links Content Summary. However, the more fundamental issue is that sensitive information is being exposed, which then leads to privilege management issues. The exposure (**CWE-201**) is the root cause and therefore the primary CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
