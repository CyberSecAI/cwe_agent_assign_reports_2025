  "description": "An **improper authorization** vulnerability exists in the zenml-io/zenml repository, specifically within the API PUT /api/v1/users/id endpoint. This vulnerability allows any authenticated user to modify the information of other users, including changing the `active` status of user accounts to false, effectively deactivating them. This issue affects version 0.55.3 and was fixed in version 0.56.2. The impact of this vulnerability is significant as it allows for the deactivation of admin accounts, potentially disrupting the functionality and security of the application.",

  "reference_content": "The provided content is related to a commit in the `zenml-io/zenml` repository that addresses an \"activation vulnerability\" and introduces admin users. This commit includes several changes related to user management, permissions, and RBAC (Role-Based Access Control).\n\nHere's a breakdown of the relevant information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n- The commit message `close activation vulnerability` suggests that there was a flaw in how user accounts were being activated or managed, potentially leading to unauthorized access or privilege escalation. The specific nature of the activation vulnerability is not explicitly stated but implied to be related to the new admin user functionality.\n- The code changes reveal that previously, users could be created without a password and be active, but now this is being changed and the user must be active if they are not a REST user\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- The vulnerability appears to be related to the activation process and potentially how user permissions are handled. The commit introduces the concept of \"admin\" users, and the fix includes a mechanism to verify admin permissions in endpoints, preventing unauthorized access.\n- The original issue allowed creation of users without a password and them being active.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- Without the fix, an attacker could potentially exploit the activation vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to the system or escalate their privileges to become an administrator.\n- Since the specifics of the exploit aren't available, we can assume it could result in the attacker being able to view, modify, or delete sensitive data or configurations.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- Attackers could potentially create users without passwords and become active on systems that were not using the REST API, allowing them to have access to the system.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- An attacker would need to have some level of access to the system or API to create user accounts.\n- The ability to interact with the user creation mechanism would be necessary to exploit the activation vulnerability.\n\n**Additional details:**\n\n*   **User Management Changes:** The commit introduces the concept of admin users and adds functionality for creating, updating, and listing users with admin privileges via CLI.\n*   **RBAC Implementation:** The changes verify admin permissions in API endpoints, likely to protect sensitive admin-only functions.\n*   **Migration:** The update includes a migration to transition existing users to admin users if they meet certain criteria.\n*   **Model Changes:** The commit modifies user models to include an `is_admin` field.\n*  **CLI Updates:** The user management CLI now has new options to specify if a user should be an admin and can change existing users to have admin privileges.\n* **Edge Cases:** The commit also seems to handle various edge cases, such as missing arguments and confirmation prompts before demoting an admin user.\n* **Testing:** The commit includes changes to tests that run on rest to accommodate the changes to user creation.\n\n**Summary:**\nThis commit addresses a vulnerability related to user activation, likely involving improper handling of user permissions, specifically for non-REST users. It also introduces the concept of admin users and adds relevant user management features. The vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker to create user accounts and gain unauthorized access or escalate their privileges to administrator level. The fix adds checks to verify admin permissions in the system endpoints and modifies user models and CLI to incorporate the new admin functionality.",

CWE-863 is a child of CWE-285, **Improper Authorization**, which is a more general class encompassing various authorization issues. CWE-862, **Missing Authorization**, is also related but less specific, as it describes cases where authorization checks are entirely absent.

This leads to any authenticated user being able to modify other users' information. The impact of this is the ability to deactivate user accounts, including admin accounts, which can disrupt the security and functionality of the application.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified an **improper authorization** issue in the `zenml-io/zenml` repository. The vulnerability allows any authenticated user to modify the information of other users via the `API PUT /api/v1/users/id` endpoint. This includes deactivating user accounts, even those of administrators.\n\nThe retriever results and the CWE specifications were then reviewed. The primary candidate was CWE-863, **Incorrect Authorization**, which aligns well with the vulnerability description. The vulnerability description states: \"An **improper authorization** vulnerability exists in the zenml-io/zenml repository, specifically within the API PUT /api/v1/users/id endpoint. This vulnerability allows any authenticated user to modify the information of other users\". The CWE guidance also suggests considering CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) or CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) as alternatives, but CWE-863 is more specific because it highlights that the authorization check exists but is flawed.\n\nTherefore, the primary CWE assigned is CWE-863, with a confidence score of 0.95. This is a Class-level CWE, which, according to the guidance, should ideally be replaced by a Base-level CWE if one exists that is more appropriate. However, in this case, CWE-863 accurately describes the core issue of incorrect authorization logic.\n\nCWE-285 is considered as a secondary candidate with a confidence of 0.70, as it's a broader category that encompasses the authorization flaw. CWE-862 is also considered as a secondary candidate with a confidence score of 0.60, but it's less accurate than CWE-863, as it describes the absence of an authorization check, which isn't the case here.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
