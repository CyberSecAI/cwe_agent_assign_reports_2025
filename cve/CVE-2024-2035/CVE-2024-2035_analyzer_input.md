# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-2035

## Vulnerability Description
An **improper authorization** vulnerability exists in the zenml-io/zenml repository, specifically within the API PUT /api/v1/users/id endpoint. This vulnerability allows any authenticated user to modify the information of other users, including changing the `active` status of user accounts to false, effectively deactivating them. This issue affects version 0.55.3 and was fixed in version 0.56.2. The impact of this vulnerability is significant as it allows for the deactivation of admin accounts, potentially disrupting the functionality and security of the application.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **improper authorization**
- **impact:** deactivate user accounts
- **attacker:** any authenticated user
- **product:** zenml-io/zenml
- **version:** 0.55.3
- **component:** API PUT /api/v1/users/id endpoint

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content is related to a commit in the `zenml-io/zenml` repository that addresses an "activation vulnerability" and introduces admin users. This commit includes several changes related to user management, permissions, and RBAC (Role-Based Access Control).

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The commit message `close activation vulnerability` suggests that there was a flaw in how user accounts were being activated or managed, potentially leading to unauthorized access or privilege escalation. The specific nature of the activation vulnerability is not explicitly stated but implied to be related to the new admin user functionality.
- The code changes reveal that previously, users could be created without a password and be active, but now this is being changed and the user must be active if they are not a REST user

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The vulnerability appears to be related to the activation process and potentially how user permissions are handled. The commit introduces the concept of "admin" users, and the fix includes a mechanism to verify admin permissions in endpoints, preventing unauthorized access.
- The original issue allowed creation of users without a password and them being active.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Without the fix, an attacker could potentially exploit the activation vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to the system or escalate their privileges to become an administrator.
- Since the specifics of the exploit aren't available, we can assume it could result in the attacker being able to view, modify, or delete sensitive data or configurations.

**Attack vectors:**
- Attackers could potentially create users without passwords and become active on systems that were not using the REST API, allowing them to have access to the system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need to have some level of access to the system or API to create user accounts.
- The ability to interact with the user creation mechanism would be necessary to exploit the activation vulnerability.

**Additional details:**

*   **User Management Changes:** The commit introduces the concept of admin users and adds functionality for creating, updating, and listing users with admin privileges via CLI.
*   **RBAC Implementation:** The changes verify admin permissions in API endpoints, likely to protect sensitive admin-only functions.
*   **Migration:** The update includes a migration to transition existing users to admin users if they meet certain criteria.
*   **Model Changes:** The commit modifies user models to include an `is_admin` field.
*  **CLI Updates:** The user management CLI now has new options to specify if a user should be an admin and can change existing users to have admin privileges.
* **Edge Cases:** The commit also seems to handle various edge cases, such as missing arguments and confirmation prompts before demoting an admin user.
* **Testing:** The commit includes changes to tests that run on rest to accommodate the changes to user creation.

**Summary:**
This commit addresses a vulnerability related to user activation, likely involving improper handling of user permissions, specifically for non-REST users. It also introduces the concept of admin users and adds relevant user management features. The vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker to create user accounts and gain unauthorized access or escalate their privileges to administrator level. The fix adds checks to verify admin permissions in the system endpoints and modifies user models and CLI to incorporate the new admin functionality.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control

**Authentication**:
Determines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.

* Example phrases: "user must log in", "lack of login check", "bypasses login"
* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.

  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* – used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).

**Authorization**:
Determines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do. It decides access *after* identity is verified.

* Example phrases: "unauthorized access", "regular user can access admin panel", "role checks are missing"
* CWE relevance: use CWEs like 862, 863, 285 for authorization errors:

  * **CWE-862**: *Missing Authorization* – the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all.
  * **CWE-863**: *Incorrect Authorization* – the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).
  * **CWE-285**: *Improper Authorization* – general category for any flawed authorization logic or design.

**Access Control**:
A broader term that includes both authentication and authorization. Governs how resources are protected and who can access them under what conditions.

* CWE relevance:

  * **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* – top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear.
  * This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.

## Mapping Discussion – Common Misclassification Patterns

### 1. **CWE-306 vs CWE-862**:

* **306** is about lack of **authentication** (e.g., *no login required at all*).
* **862** is about lack of **authorization** *after* authentication (e.g., *admin check missing*).
* ✅ Example CWE-306: *“An unauthenticated attacker can invoke the password reset API.”*
* ✅ Example CWE-862: *“An authenticated user without admin privileges can delete any user account.”*

### 2. **CWE-285 vs CWE-284**:

* **285** is specific to authorization flaws – it's a better choice than 284 **if** the issue involves *improper or missing role checks*.
* **284** should be reserved for general access control issues when it’s unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.

---

## Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification

**Phrase like "unauthorized access" is not enough.**

* If you **cannot determine whether identity was checked**, assume it’s **authorization** and consider 862 or 863.
* If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** → CWE-306.
* If the **access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced**, but it's not due to missing checks, consider **CWE-284**.

---

## Good Mapping Examples

* ✅ **CWE-306**: “The endpoint `/admin/deleteUser` does not require any authentication.”
* ✅ **CWE-862**: “Any logged-in user can change any other user's email without being an admin.”
* ✅ **CWE-863**: “An admin check exists but incorrectly grants access to non-admin users.”
* ✅ **CWE-285**: “Application uses a static role check that fails when roles change dynamically.”
* ✅ **CWE-284**: “Inconsistent enforcement of access rules across services with unclear policy source.”
