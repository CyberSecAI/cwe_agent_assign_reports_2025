The key evidence is in the **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases** which states the **rootcause** is \"**Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component (Injection)**\" and the **impact** is \"**Code Inclusion**\". The Retriever Results listed CWE-74 as the top candidate, but also showed CWE-94, CWE-95, CWE-96 and CWE-1336, all children of CWE-74.
