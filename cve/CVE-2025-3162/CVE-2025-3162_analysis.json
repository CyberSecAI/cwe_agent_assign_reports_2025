  "description": "A vulnerability was found in InternLM LMDeploy up to 0.7.1. It has been classified as critical. Affected is the function load_weight_ckpt of the file lmdeploy/lmdeploy/vl/model/utils.py of the component PT File Handler. The manipulation leads to **deserialization**. Attacking locally is a requirement. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.",

There are no direct parent-child relationships that significantly impact the decision, as CWE-502 is already quite specific. No chain relationships appear directly relevant.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe502[\"CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data\"]\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe502 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward:\n1.  **Root Cause:** CWE-502 (**deserialization** of untrusted data via `torch.load` without `weights_only=True`).\n2.  **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is the **deserialization** of untrusted data. The provided evidence clearly points to CWE-502. The `load_weight_ckpt` function uses `torch.load` to deserialize `.pt` files without proper validation, creating an opportunity for arbitrary code execution.\n\nThe retriever results listed CWE-502 with a high score, confirming its relevance. The description mentions that the `load_weight_ckpt` function uses `torch.load` to deserialize untrusted `.pt` files, which aligns perfectly with the definition of CWE-502.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-90: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an LDAP Query ('LDAP Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an LDAP query using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended LDAP query when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1286: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input that is expected to be well-formed -
