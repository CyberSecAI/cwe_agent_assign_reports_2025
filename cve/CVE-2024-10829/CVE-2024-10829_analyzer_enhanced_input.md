## Vulnerability Description
A Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability in the multipart request boundary processing mechanism of eosphoros-ai/db-gpt v0.6.0 allows unauthenticated attackers to cause excessive resource consumption. The server **fails to handle excessive characters appended to the end of multipart boundaries**, leading to an **infinite loop** and complete denial of service for all users. This vulnerability affects all endpoints processing multipart/form-data requests.
