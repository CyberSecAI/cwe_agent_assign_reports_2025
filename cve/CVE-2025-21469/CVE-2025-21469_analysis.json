CWE-787 is a base level CWE which is good, but other children were checked to see if they were a better fit. There is no explicit chain of events mentioned in the description, only the **memory corruption** **rootcause**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is simple: a zero-length input buffer during image encoding processing in an IOCTL call leads to **memory corruption**, specifically an out-of-bounds write.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, which is limited. The description mentions **memory corruption** when the input buffer length is 0 in an IOCTL call.
