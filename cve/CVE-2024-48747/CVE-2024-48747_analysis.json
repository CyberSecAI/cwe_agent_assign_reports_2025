It has parent CWEs like CWE-77 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command) and CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')). The relationship analysis highlights the potential for command injection due to **improper neutralization** of special elements. CWE-912 is a Class-level CWE and could indicate a deliberate attempt to hide malicious functionality.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    cwe912[\"CWE-912: Hidden Functionality\"]\n    \n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe77,cwe74,cwe912 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper neutralization** of special elements in an OS command (CWE-78), potentially leading to arbitrary code execution. The presence of a file named \"/atv-cli\" suggests the potential for command injection via this specific file, and the arbitrary code execution as the final impact.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary assessment is based on the vulnerability description indicating that a remote attacker can execute arbitrary code via the /atv-cli file in alist-tvbox v1.7.1. The root cause appears to be related to command injection, specifically CWE-78. However, evidence is weak.\n\nThe \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section has \"NOINFO\", indicating that the PDF content could not be reviewed and verified in this setting. The confidence score is thus lowered.\n\n*   CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') is selected as the primary CWE because the vulnerability description indicates arbitrary code execution, which is a common impact of command injection vulnerabilities. The vulnerability involves a specific file (/atv-cli), suggesting a direct mechanism for injecting commands.\n*   CWE-912: Hidden Functionality is considered as a secondary candidate. Since the attack happens via `/atv-cli` file, it could be possible this file is for hidden functionality.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-88: Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs a string for a command to be executed by a separate component\nin another control sphere, but it does not properly delimit the\nintended arguments, options, or switches within that command string.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.67\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
