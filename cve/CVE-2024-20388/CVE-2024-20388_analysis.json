  "description": "A vulnerability in the password change feature of Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to determine valid user names on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to **improper authentication** of password update responses. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by forcing a password reset on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to determine valid user names in the unauthenticated response to a forced password reset.",

Given that the vulnerability description highlights **improper authentication** in the context of a password change feature, CWE-287 serves as a suitable high-level classification. However, the observable discrepancy in the response leading to information disclosure also suggests a potential secondary weakness related to information exposure.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe640[\"CWE-640: Weak Password Recovery Mechanism for Forgotten Password\"]\n    cwe203[\"CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy\"]\n    cwe204[\"CWE-204: Observable Response Discrepancy\"]\n    \n    cwe306 -->|ChildOf| cwe287\n    cwe640 -->|ChildOf| cwe287\n    cwe204 -->|PeerOf| cwe203\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe287 primary\n    class cwe203,cwe204 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper authentication** within the password change feature. This leads to an observable discrepancy in the response, enabling an attacker to determine valid usernames, resulting in information disclosure.\n  - **Root Cause:** **Improper Authentication** (CWE-287)\n  - **Weakness:** Observable Response Discrepancy (CWE-203 or CWE-204)\n  - **Impact:** Information Disclosure (Valid Usernames)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis pointed towards CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) due to the vulnerability description explicitly mentioning **improper authentication** of password update responses. The key phrase \"improper authentication\" directly supports this classification. However, the impact of determining valid usernames suggests a potential information disclosure issue, leading to the consideration of CWE-203 (Observable Discrepancy) and CWE-204 (Observable Response Discrepancy) as secondary weaknesses.\n\nThe final decision is based on the provided evidence, which emphasizes the authentication flaw as the primary driver of the vulnerability. While the observable discrepancy contributes to the exploitability and impact, the root cause lies in the authentication process itself. Therefore, CWE-287 is selected as the primary CWE, with CWE-203 and CWE-204 as secondary candidates. The level of specificity is appropriate, as CWE-287 captures the general authentication issue, while the other CWEs represent the specific manifestation of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-204: Observable Response Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product provides different responses to incoming requests in a way that reveals internal state information to an unauthorized actor outside of the intended control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product requires authentication, but the product has an alternate path or channel that does not require authentication.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
