  "reference_content": "The content is related to CVE-2024-41228, it describes a Time-of-Check Time-of-Use (TOCTTOU) vulnerability in the `pouch cp` command of Pouch container engine.\n\n- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A race condition exists in the `ExtractToDir()` function within `daemon/mgr/container_copy.go` of Pouch. This function is used when copying files into a container. The vulnerability arises between the `os.Lstat()` check on the target path and the subsequent `chrootarchive.Untar()` operation.\n- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The TOCTTOU vulnerability allows an attacker within a container to replace a target directory with a symlink after the initial check but before the file extraction.\n- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can overwrite sensitive files on the host filesystem by creating a symlink that points to a host path. This enables the attacker to achieve container escape and gain unauthorized write access to the host system.\n- **Attack vectors**: An attacker with control of a container can exploit the vulnerability by repeatedly creating and deleting a directory, then creating a symlink in its place, while simultaneously requesting an administrator to copy a file into the container to the same path. The timing of the symlink creation has to race with pouch cp operation.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have control over a container and the ability to make requests via the platform's API to copy files into a specific path inside the container. The attacker must also be able to execute code within the container to create the symlink in a race condition. Additionally, a separate user with administrator privileges must initiate the copy operation.\n\nThe document also provides further information about the vulnerability and potential fixes:\n- The vulnerability can be exploited under two conditions: either runc is set as the container runtime or runsc (gVisor) is used as the container runtime and a file is copied from the host to the shared volume between the container and host.\n- The root cause of the susceptibility is that Pouch utilizes an old version of chrootarchive package, whereas newer versions used by docker have implemented security checks to set the root of the chroot to the container's rootfs.\n- A suggested workaround is to update the chrootarchive package.",

The vulnerability arises from a race condition between checking the state of a resource and using it, allowing an attacker to manipulate the resource in between. |\n| CWE-59 | Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following') | 0.8 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The TOCTOU race condition allows an attacker to replace a directory with a symlink, leading to the 'Link Following' vulnerability where the system accesses an unintended resource. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary weakness is CWE-367, which describes a Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition.

An attacker exploits this race condition to replace a directory with a symbolic link. When the system attempts to access the original directory, it instead follows the symbolic link, leading to Improper Link Resolution (CWE-59). This results in the attacker gaining unauthorized write access to the host system, potentially escalating privileges.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary vulnerability is a Time-of-Check Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race condition (CWE-367) in the `pouch cp` function of AliyunContainerService pouch v1.3.1. The content summary clearly states: \"A race condition exists in the `ExtractToDir()` function... The vulnerability arises between the `os.Lstat()` check on the target path and the subsequent `chrootarchive.Untar()` operation.\" This perfectly matches the description of CWE-367, where a resource's state changes between the check and the use. The impact of this race condition is that an attacker can replace a directory with a symlink, leading to Improper Link Resolution (CWE-59) and allowing the attacker to overwrite sensitive files on the host filesystem. The relationship of CWE-367 preceding CWE-59 is clearly supported by the evidence.
