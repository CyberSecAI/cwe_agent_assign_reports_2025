CWE-287 is a Class-level CWE, while CWE-288 is a Base-level CWE, providing a more specific classification.

The root cause is the **logical flaw** enabling authentication bypass.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial assessment pointed towards an authentication-related issue, specifically concerning a **logical flaw** that enables an attacker to log in to any system account. The evidence from the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" indicates the presence of bidirectional Unicode text within files. While this is the source of the **logical flaw** and how it can be exploited, it does not match the vulnerability description.\n\nThe primary CWE, CWE-288 Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel, was selected as it best describes the **weakness** where an attacker can bypass authentication to access any system account. The description clearly states that an attacker can bypass the intended authentication mechanism due to a **logical flaw**.\n\nCWE-287 Improper Authentication was considered as a parent class but not chosen as the primary due to its higher level of abstraction.\n\nThe selection is based on the provided evidence and the hierarchical relationship between CWE-287 and CWE-288.
