  "description": "`gix-path` is a crate of the `gitoxide` project (an implementation of `git` written in Rust) dealing paths and their conversions. Prior to version 0.10.11, `gix-path` runs `git` to find the path of a configuration file associated with the `git` installation, but **improperly resolves paths containing unusual or non-ASCII characters**, in rare cases enabling a local attacker to inject configuration leading to code execution. Version 0.10.11 contains a patch for the issue. In `gix_pathenv`, the underlying implementation of the `installation_config` and `installation_config_prefix` functions calls `git config -l --show-origin` to find the path of a file to treat as belonging to the `git` installation. Affected versions of `gix-path` do not pass `-z`/`--null` to cause `git` to report literal paths. Instead, to cover the occasional case that `git` outputs a quoted path, they attempt to parse the path by stripping the quotation marks. The problem is that, when a path is quoted, it may change in substantial ways beyond the concatenation of quotation marks. If not reversed, these changes can result in another valid path that is not equivalent to the original. On a single-user system, it is not possible to exploit this, unless `GIT_CONFIG_SYSTEM` and `GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL` have been set to unusual values or Git has been installed in an unusual way. Such a scenario is not expected. Exploitation is unlikely even on a multi-user system, though it is plausible in some uncommon configurations",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-45405:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from `gix-path` improperly parsing the configuration file path returned by the `git config -l --show-origin` command. Instead of using the `-z`/`--null` option to ensure literal paths are returned, it attempts to parse the output by stripping quotation marks. This fails to account for how `git` may encode unusual characters, such as non-ASCII characters, which it escapes with backslashes and octal representations. This leads to the possibility that a different, attacker-controlled path can be misinterpreted as the actual configuration file path.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n- **Improper Input Handling:** The core issue lies in the incorrect parsing of the configuration file path. The code does not properly handle paths with special characters that Git might quote and escape.\n- **Path Traversal/Injection:** By manipulating the path, an attacker can redirect the application to load a malicious configuration file from an arbitrary location.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By injecting a crafted configuration file, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the system. The proof of concept shows that by configuring `core.sshCommand` to execute `calc.exe`, the attacker can cause the calculator to run. This demonstrates the potential for any arbitrary command execution.\n- **Configuration Tampering:** An attacker could modify other Git configuration settings, potentially leading to further security issues such as leaking credentials, hijacking workflows, or introducing malicious content.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n- **Local Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable by a local attacker who has a limited user account on the system. The attacker needs to be able to create files and directories.\n- **File System Manipulation:** The attacker creates a specially crafted configuration file at a path that, due to the parsing vulnerability, will be misinterpreted by `gix-path`.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n- **Local User Account:** The attacker needs a local user account on the target system, not necessarily with admin privileges.\n- **File Creation:** The attacker needs to be able to create files and directories at specific locations, which might include locations within other user profiles in some scenarios.\n- **Specific System Configuration:** Exploitation is more likely if the target system:\n    - Allows usernames with characters that Git quotes.\n    - Lacks system-wide Git installation or has Git installed in a predictable location.\n    - Has specific environment variables set, such as `GIT_CONFIG_SYSTEM`, to point to unusual locations.\n    - Has a `system`-scope configuration file absent, empty, or suppressed by means other than `GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM`, allowing a global config file to be used as a substitute\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n- The vulnerability is more easily exploited on Windows due to the use of backslashes as directory separators and the ability to have usernames containing characters that Git quotes.\n- The fix is to use the `-z`/`--null` and `--name-only` options with the `git config` command, which will output literal paths separated by null bytes and not include values. This avoids the need to parse escaped paths.\n- The vulnerability has a moderate severity score, as it requires specific conditions and user interaction to exploit.\n\nThis analysis provides a more complete picture of the vulnerability than the initial CVE description.",

The `gix-path` library **fails to properly validate or sanitize the paths** of configuration files, allowing an attacker to manipulate these paths. This aligns directly with the description of CWE-73, which states that \"The product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.\" The evidence for this is found in the **Vulnerability Description**, which states that `gix-path` **improperly resolves paths containing unusual or non-ASCII characters**.\n\nCWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data) is considered a secondary weakness, as the **improperly resolved path** can be seen as sensitive information being inserted into the application's data flow.\n\nCWE-78 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')) is also a secondary candidate because the vulnerability can lead to code execution through command injection. The **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** explicitly mentions the possibility of arbitrary code execution by injecting a crafted configuration file. However, this is a consequence of the path manipulation, not the primary weakness.\n\nI considered CWE-22 (Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')) but determined that it was not as accurate as CWE-73. While path traversal is a potential outcome of this vulnerability, the **root cause is the lack of proper control over the file name or path itself**, not specifically the traversal of directories.\n\nI also considered CWE-88 (Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')), but this is more related to the command itself than the path. The code execution occurs due to the **improperly parsed path**, which points to a malicious configuration file, not necessarily due to argument injection into the `git config` command.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly address the **root cause of the vulnerability (CWE-73)** and its immediate consequences (CWE-201, CWE-78). They provide a clear and accurate representation of the weakness based on the available evidence.",
