  "description": "A vulnerability has been found in BDCOM Behavior Management and Auditing System up to 20250210 and classified as critical. Affected by this vulnerability is the function log_operate_clear of the file /webui/modules/log/operate.mds. The manipulation of the argument start_code leads to **os command injection**. The attack can be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",
