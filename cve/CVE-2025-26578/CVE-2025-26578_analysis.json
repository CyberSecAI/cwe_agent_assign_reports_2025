The vulnerability description also mentions Stored XSS, which is represented by CWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')]. These two vulnerabilities are distinct but related in this context. CSRF can potentially lead to stored XSS if the attacker can manipulate the application into storing malicious scripts.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    \n    cwe352 -->|CAN_LEAD_TO| cwe79\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe352 primary\n    class cwe79 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** **weakness** (CWE-352), which allows an attacker to force a user to perform actions they did not intend to. This can lead to Stored XSS (CWE-79) if the attacker uses the CSRF vulnerability to inject malicious scripts into the application that are then stored and executed by other users.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that there is a \"Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability... allows Stored XSS.\" The **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases** also highlight both **Cross-Site Request Forgery** and **XSS vulnerability**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms \"Root cause of vulnerability: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\" and \"Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) in the Simple Documentation plugin\". Therefore, CWE-352 is the primary root cause. The retriever results also list both CWE-79 and CWE-352 with high relevance. CWE-79 is selected as the secondary weakness because the CSRF vulnerability allows Stored XSS.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the appropriate level of specificity, with CWE-352 being a Compound weakness and CWE-79 being a Base weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
