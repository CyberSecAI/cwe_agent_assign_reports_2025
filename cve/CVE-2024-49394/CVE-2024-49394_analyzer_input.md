# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-49394

## Vulnerability Description
In mutt and neomutt the In-Reply-To email header field is not protected by cryptographic signing which allows an attacker to reuse an unencrypted but signed email message to impersonate the original sender.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **lack of cryptographic protection**
- **impact:** reuse unencrypted but signed email message to impersonate original sender
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** mutt and neomutt
- **component:** In-Reply-To email header field

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-49394:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the fact that the `In-Reply-To` email header field is not protected by cryptographic signing in Mutt and Neomutt email clients.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of cryptographic protection:** The `In-Reply-To` header, which is used to link emails in a conversation, is not included in the cryptographic signature of an email.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Email Impersonation:** An attacker can reuse a signed email message and modify the `In-Reply-To` field to impersonate the original sender. This can lead to social engineering attacks where an attacker appears to be a legitimate participant in an email conversation, potentially tricking recipients into taking malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Email manipulation:** The attacker needs to obtain a signed email message from the legitimate sender.
*   **Header modification:**  The attacker modifies the `In-Reply-To` field in the copied, signed message.
*   **Resending the email:**  The attacker then resends the modified message.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to signed emails:** The attacker needs access to at least one legitimate, signed email from the target user.
*   **Ability to manipulate email headers:** The attacker needs the ability to alter the `In-Reply-To` header of the email.
*   **Capability to send emails:** The attacker needs to be able to send the modified email to intended victims.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in both Mutt and Neomutt email clients.
*   The severity is rated as low.
*   The bug report mentions that the issue allows an attacker to reuse an "unencrypted but signed email".
*   This vulnerability allows for the potential for social engineering attacks, since the email recipient will believe the email came from a legitimate contact.
