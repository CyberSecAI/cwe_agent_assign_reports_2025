There are no relevant parent or child relationships that would suggest a more appropriate CWE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe89 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **SQL Injection** (**CWE-89**) due to improper neutralization of input.\n2.  **Impact:** Remote attackers can manipulate SQL queries, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that the vulnerability is due to **SQL Injection**. The manipulation of the argument `custTradeId` leads to the injection. The Retriever Results also lists CWE-89 as the top result with a score of 1.0.
