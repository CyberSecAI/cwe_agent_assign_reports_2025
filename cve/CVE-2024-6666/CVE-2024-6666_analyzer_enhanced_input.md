## Vulnerability Description
The WP ERP plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the vendor_id parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.13.0 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Accounting Manager access (erp_ac_view_sales_summary capability) and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**
- **weakness:** **SQL injection**
- **impact:** extract sensitive information from the database
- **attacker:** authenticated attackers
- **product:** WP ERP plugin for WordPress
- **version:** up to and including 1.13.0
- **component:** vendor_id parameter

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-6666

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization and preparation of user-supplied parameters within SQL queries. Specifically, the `vendor_id` and `status` parameters are not properly escaped before being incorporated into SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. Due to the lack of proper sanitization, an attacker can inject malicious SQL code through the vulnerable parameters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Extraction:** A successful SQL injection attack allows an attacker to extract sensitive information from the database. This could include user credentials, financial data, or other confidential information.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is triggered via the `vendor_id` and `status` parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to have an authenticated session with a user account having at least "Accounting Manager" access (specifically the `erp_ac_view_sales_summary` capability).

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects all versions of the WP ERP plugin up to and including 1.13.0.
*   The patched version is 1.13.1, which addresses the SQL injection issue.
*   The code diff provided shows that the fix involved using `$wpdb->prepare()` to properly sanitize and prepare the SQL queries, preventing SQL injection attacks by handling parameters correctly.

**Summary of Changes in Code Diff:**

The code diff highlights the changes made to address the SQL injection vulnerability. The key changes involve replacing direct string concatenation of user-provided parameters into SQL queries with the `$wpdb->prepare()` method. This method ensures that user inputs are properly escaped and prevent the execution of malicious SQL commands. For example, this change is visible in multiple parts of the diff:

*   Old: `$where .= " AND (invoice.customer_id = {$args['customer_id']} OR invoice_receipt.customer_id = {$args['customer_id']}) ";`
*   New: `$where .= $wpdb->prepare( " AND (invoice.customer_id = %d OR invoice_receipt.customer_id = %d) ", $args['customer_id'], $args['customer_id'] );`

This pattern of change is repeated for other parameters like `start_date`, `status`, `type`, `number`, `people_id`, and `vendor_id`.

The diff also shows the replacement of string concatenation for the ORDER BY clause with a prepared query.

* Old: `ORDER BY voucher.id {$args['order']}`
* New:  `ORDER BY {$orderby}`
