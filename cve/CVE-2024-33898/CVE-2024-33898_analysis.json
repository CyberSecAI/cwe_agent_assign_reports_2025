However, after further review and consideration of the vulnerability description key phrases and the CVE reference links content summary, CWE-288 was selected as the primary CWE.

The vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"authorization bypass,\" which aligns with the concept of bypassing authentication mechanisms.\nCWE-284, Improper Access Control, is a high-level category that is less specific than CWE-288.
