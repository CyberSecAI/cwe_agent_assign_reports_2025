  "description": "A vulnerability was found in LB-LINK AC1900 Router 1.0.2 and classified as critical. Affected by this issue is the function websGetVar of the file /goform/set_blacklist. The manipulation of the argument mac/enable leads to **os command injection**. The attack may be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",

It has relationships with other CWEs, such as being a child of CWE-77 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command) and CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component). There are also chain relationships, such as CANFOLLOW to CWE-184 (Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs).

The retriever results also list CWE-78 as the top candidate. CWE-78 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')) is the most appropriate CWE because the **weakness** is directly related to the **improper neutralization** of input that leads to the execution of unintended OS commands. The evidence from the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section indicates the **weakness** is **os command injection**. The confidence score is 1.0 because the description explicitly states the **vulnerability** is an **OS command injection**, and the retriever results confirm this. Other CWEs were considered, but were not as specific as CWE-78. For example, CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')) is a more general injection weakness, and CWE-77 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')) is a class level.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n**CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')**\nThe product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.",
