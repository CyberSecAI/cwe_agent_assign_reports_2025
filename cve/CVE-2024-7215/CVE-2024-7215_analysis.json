  "description": "A vulnerability was found in TOTOLINK LR1200 9.3.1cu.2832 and classified as critical. Affected by this issue is the function NTPSyncWithHost of the file /cgi-bin/cstecgi.cgi. The manipulation of the argument host_time leads to **command injection**. The attack may be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. VDB-272786 is the identifier assigned to this vulnerability. NOTE The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",

  },
  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability stems from a command injection flaw within the `NTPSyncWithHost` function of the TOTOLINK LR1200 router's firmware. Specifically, the `host_time` parameter from a POST request is directly used in a system call without proper sanitization or validation.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- Command Injection: The primary weakness is the lack of input sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary commands through the `host_time` parameter.\n- Unvalidated Input: The router software does not validate the content of the `host_time` parameter before using it in a system call.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- Arbitrary Command Execution: A successful exploit allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the router's operating system with the privileges of the running process.\n- Full System Compromise: This can lead to complete control of the device, allowing the attacker to potentially eavesdrop on network traffic, modify configurations, or use the device as part of a botnet.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- HTTP POST Request: The attack vector is a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/cgi-bin/cstecgi.cgi` endpoint, specifically targeting the `NTPSyncWithHost` function.\n- Malicious `host_time` Parameter: The attacker includes malicious commands within the `host_time` parameter of the POST request.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- Network Access: The attacker needs network access to the router, either via the local network or, if exposed, through the internet.\n- Knowledge of the Vulnerable Endpoint: The attacker needs to know the vulnerable URL (`/cgi-bin/cstecgi.cgi`) and the `NTPSyncWithHost` function.\n- Ability to Send HTTP POST Requests: The attacker requires the ability to send HTTP POST requests with the required parameters.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n- The vulnerability is present in the TOTOLINK LR1200 router firmware version V9.3.1cu.2832.\n- The provided POC demonstrates how to inject the command `ls -al ../` using the `host_time` parameter.",

CWE-78 (OS Command Injection) is a child of CWE-77 (Command Injection). Since the vulnerability specifically involves OS commands, CWE-78 is the more precise and appropriate choice.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')\"]\n    \n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe77 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper neutralization** of the `host_time` argument, leading to the execution of arbitrary OS commands.\n  - **Root Cause:** **Improper Neutralization** of input.\n  - **Weakness:** OS Command Injection.\n  - **Impact:** Arbitrary command execution and potential full system compromise.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis indicates a clear case of OS Command Injection due to the **improper neutralization** of special elements within the `host_time` parameter. The vulnerability description and the provided content summary confirm that the `host_time` parameter is used to construct an OS command without proper sanitization, allowing attackers to inject and execute arbitrary commands.\n\nThe selection of CWE-78 is primarily based on the explicit mention of \"command injection\" and the fact that the injected commands are executed at the OS level. This makes CWE-78 a more specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability compared to its parent, CWE-77.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-790: Improper Filtering of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives data from an upstream component, but does not filter or incorrectly filters special elements before sending it to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product establishes a communication channel to (or from) an endpoint for privileged or protected operations, but it does not properly ensure that it is communicating with the correct endpoint.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-294: Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA capture-replay flaw exists when the design of the product makes it possible for a malicious user to sniff network traffic and bypass authentication by replaying it to the server in question to the same effect as the original message (or with minor changes).\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1286: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input that is expected to be well-formed -
