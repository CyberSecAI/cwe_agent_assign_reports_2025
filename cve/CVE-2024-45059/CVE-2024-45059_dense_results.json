A SQL Injection vulnerability was found prior to the 2.9 branch in the `ieducar/intranet/funcionario_vinculo_det.php` file, which creates the query by concatenating the unsanitized GET parameter `cod_func`, allowing the attacker to obtain sensitive information such as emails and password hashes. Commit 7824b95745fa2da6476b9901041d9c854bf52ffe fixes the issue.",
