# Raw Analyzer Response for CVE-2024-55653

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-703 | Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions | 1.0 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-252 | Unchecked Return Value | 0.7 | Base | Secondary Candidate | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-703, which focuses on the broader issue of improper handling of exceptional conditions. While there are no direct parent-child relationships explicitly defined in the provided context, this CWE serves as a general category. CWE-252 is included as a secondary candidate because the **UnhandledPromiseRejection** can be viewed as a specific case of an unchecked return value from an asynchronous operation. The chosen CWEs are at the Base level, providing an appropriate level of detail.

## Vulnerability Chain
The chain of events for this vulnerability is as follows:
1.  The application contains an asynchronous function that can result in a promise rejection.
2.  The application **fails to check or handle** this rejection (**CWE-703**).
3.  The **UnhandledPromiseRejection** crashes the backend, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

The root cause is the **lack of proper error handling** for promise rejections. The impact is a denial-of-service condition.

## Summary of Analysis
Initially, several CWEs were considered based on the retriever results, including CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data), CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key), and CWE-918 (Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)). However, these did not accurately reflect the core issue, which is the application's **failure to handle promise rejections properly**.

The primary CWE, CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions), directly addresses the root cause. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" explicitly states that the application's backend **does not handle promise rejections properly**. This aligns with the description of CWE-703, which focuses on the **improper handling of exceptional conditions**.

CWE-252 (Unchecked Return Value) was considered a secondary candidate because the **UnhandledPromiseRejection** can be viewed as a specific instance of an unchecked return value, especially since promises are often used to handle the results of asynchronous operations.

The final selection is based on the evidence that the core issue is a **lack of error handling for promise rejections**, which leads to the backend crashing. The chosen CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, providing a clear and accurate representation of the vulnerability.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-346: Origin Validation Error
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly verify that the source of data or communication is valid.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-617: Reachable Assertion
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product contains an assert() or similar statement that can be triggered by an attacker, which leads to an application exit or other behavior that is more severe than necessary.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.



## CWE-204: Observable Response Discrepancy
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product provides different responses to incoming requests in a way that reveals internal state information to an unauthorized actor outside of the intended control sphere.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-252: Unchecked Return Value
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
