  "description": "PwnDoc is a penetration test report generator. In versions up to and including 0.5.3, an authenticated user is able to crash the backend by raising a `**UnhandledPromiseRejection**` on audits which exits the backend. The user doesnt need to know the audit id, since a bad audit id will also raise the rejection. With the backend being unresponsive, the whole application becomes unusable for all users of the application. As of time of publication, no known patches are available.",

  },
  "reference_content": "- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application's backend does not handle promise rejections properly in asynchronous functions, specifically in the `audit.js` route. When a promise is rejected without a corresponding `.catch()` or error handler, it leads to an `UnhandledPromiseRejection` which causes the backend to crash.\n- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Lack of error handling in asynchronous functions within the audit route. Specifically, the identified vulnerable endpoints within `backend/src/routes/audit.js` lack proper error handling for promise rejections.\n- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, rendering the application unusable for all users due to the backend crashing.\n- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attacks, where an attacker sends malicious HTTP requests to specific API endpoints.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker must be an authenticated user with the ability to make API requests. The attacker doesn't need to know a valid audit ID, as the vulnerability can be triggered with a bad ID as well.",

While there are no direct parent-child relationships explicitly defined in the provided context, this CWE serves as a general category. CWE-252 is included as a secondary candidate because the **UnhandledPromiseRejection** can be viewed as a specific case of an unchecked return value from an asynchronous operation. The chosen CWEs are at the Base level, providing an appropriate level of detail.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe703[\"CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions\"]\n    cwe252[\"CWE-252: Unchecked Return Value\"]\n\n    cwe252 -->|RELATED_TO| cwe703\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe703 primary\n    class cwe252 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events for this vulnerability is as follows:\n1.  The application contains an asynchronous function that can result in a promise rejection.\n2.  The application **fails to check or handle** this rejection (**CWE-703**).\n3.  The **UnhandledPromiseRejection** crashes the backend, leading to a denial-of-service condition.\n\nThe root cause is the **lack of proper error handling** for promise rejections. The impact is a denial-of-service condition.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, several CWEs were considered based on the retriever results, including CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data), CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key), and CWE-918 (Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)). However, these did not accurately reflect the core issue, which is the application's **failure to handle promise rejections properly**.\n\nThe primary CWE, CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions), directly addresses the root cause. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" explicitly states that the application's backend **does not handle promise rejections properly**. This aligns with the description of CWE-703, which focuses on the **improper handling of exceptional conditions**.\n\nCWE-252 (Unchecked Return Value) was considered a secondary candidate because the **UnhandledPromiseRejection** can be viewed as a specific instance of an unchecked return value, especially since promises are often used to handle the results of asynchronous operations.\n\nThe final selection is based on the evidence that the core issue is a **lack of error handling for promise rejections**, which leads to the backend crashing. The chosen CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, providing a clear and accurate representation of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following
