A successful exploit could allow an attacker to gain access to sensitive information.\\n*   **Attack Vector:** Local access is required. An attacker needs to have the ability to execute code on the affected machine.\\n*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker requires high privileges on the local machine.\\n*   **Affected Products:** Dell Precision 7920 Rack and 7920 XL Rack systems with BIOS versions prior to 2.22.1.\\n*   **Resolution:** Update BIOS to version 2.22.1 or later.\\n\\nThe provided document gives more specific information than what a typical CVE description would contain.
