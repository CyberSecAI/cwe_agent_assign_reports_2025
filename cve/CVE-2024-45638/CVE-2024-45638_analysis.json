The application **stores user credentials in plain text**. |\n| CWE-522 | Insufficiently Protected Credentials | 0.7 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary candidate. The credentials are not protected in storage. |\n| CWE-312 | Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary candidate. Information stored is sensitive.|\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-256, which is a Base level CWE and a child of CWE-522. CWE-522 is a class-level CWE. The vulnerability clearly states that credentials are stored in plaintext, therefore CWE-256 is the most appropriate. CWE-312 is also considered because it deals with the storage of sensitive information in cleartext.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe256[\"CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    \n    cwe256 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe256 primary\n    class cwe522,cwe312 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward:\n1.  **Root Cause:** CWE-256 - **Plaintext Storage of a Password**. The application **stores user credentials in plain text**.\n2.  Impact: A local privileged user can read the credentials.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description, which explicitly states that user credentials are stored in plaintext. This directly corresponds to CWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password). The retriever results also list CWE-256 as the top candidate.\n\nThe relationships between CWEs support the selection of CWE-256. While CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials) is a parent of CWE-256, CWE-256 provides a more specific description of the vulnerability. CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information) is a broader category, and CWE-256 specifically addresses the storage of passwords in plaintext, making it the most appropriate choice.\n\nThe evidence is strong, and the selection of CWE-256 is at the optimal level of specificity.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
