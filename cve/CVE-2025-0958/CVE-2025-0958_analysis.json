CWE-425 is a child of CWE-862 providing more specific information about the missing authorization on restricted URLs. The relationship shows a hierarchical structure where the base CWE provides further context to the class CWE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe425[\"CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\"]\n    \n    cwe425 -->|CHILDOF| cwe862\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe425 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of weaknesses begins with **missing authorization** checks (CWE-862), which allows authenticated users with low privileges (Contributor) to directly request and perform actions (CWE-425) such as deleting arbitrary auctions, posts, and pages, leading to unauthorized data modification and potential data loss.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focuses on the **missing authorization** issue. The vulnerability description states that \"authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to delete arbitrary auctions, posts as well as pages and allows them to execute other actions related to auction handling.\" This directly implies a lack of proper authorization checks, aligning with CWE-862.\n\nThe evidence from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary indicates that the fixes implemented include \"Reviewed and updated all WP\\_Ajax calls to include nonce verification and user permission checks,\" further supporting the **missing authorization** aspect.\n\nThe graph relationships also helped refine the selection. While CWE-862 is a class-level CWE, it accurately represents the high-level weakness. CWE-425 provides a more specific description of the vulnerability, detailing how the **missing authorization** leads to direct requests being executed without proper validation. This refinement ensures that the selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity.\n\nBased on the evidence, relationship analysis, and mapping guidance, the final selection is CWE-862 as the primary weakness and CWE-425 as a secondary weakness providing more context.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.\n\n\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
