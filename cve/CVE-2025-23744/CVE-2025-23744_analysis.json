The vulnerability is a Cross-site Scripting (XSS) issue due to **improper neutralization of input**. |\n| CWE-80 | Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS) | 0.7 | Variant | Allowed | Secondary candidate. CWE-80 is a more specific variant of CWE-79, focusing on script-related HTML tags. It is a potential secondary candidate if the XSS is specifically related to HTML tags. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship influencing the decision is the parent-child relationship between CWE-79 and CWE-80. CWE-80 is a variant of CWE-79, providing a more specific classification when the XSS involves script-related HTML tags.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe80[\"CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\"]\n    \n    cwe80 -->|CHILDOF| cwe79\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe79 primary\n    class cwe80 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper neutralization of input**, leading directly to Cross-site Scripting.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, which explicitly states that the vulnerability is due to **improper neutralization of input during web page generation**, resulting in XSS. The retriever results also strongly suggest CWE-79 as the primary candidate.\nThe selection of CWE-79 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the root cause (**improper neutralization**) and the resulting vulnerability (XSS).
