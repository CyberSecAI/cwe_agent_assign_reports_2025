  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-26545 Content\n\nThis content **relates** to CVE-2025-26545. It provides details about a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the \"Related Posts Line-up-Exactly by Milliard\" WordPress plugin.\n\nHere's an extraction of the relevant information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). The content does not specify the exact root cause within the plugin's code.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n*   Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\nA malicious actor could force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact varies case by case.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\nThe attack vector is through Cross-Site Request Forgery, meaning an attacker would need to trick a logged-in user into performing an action on the vulnerable website.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n*   **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated.\n*   The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious request that a logged-in user will execute.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n*   No official fix is currently available (as of February 13, 2025).\n*   Patchstack offers \"vPatching\" as a mitigation, which auto-mitigates the vulnerability even without an official patch.\n\n**Additional Details (more detail than official CVE description):**\n\n*   **Affected Software:** Related Posts Line-up-Exactly by Milliard WordPress Plugin\n*   **Vulnerable Versions:** <= 0.0.22\n*   **CVSS Score:** 7.1 (Low severity)\n*   **OWASP Top 10:** A1: Broken Access Control\n*   **PSID:** f6747915a2a6\n*   **Reported by:** Abdi Pranata\n*   **Published by:** Patchstack (February 13, 2025)\n*   **Priority:** Low",

The description also mentions \"Stored XSS,\" which maps to **CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')**. In this case, **CSRF** enables the **Stored XSS**. There is no direct relationship between these CWEs, but CSRF can lead to other vulnerabilities, including XSS, if the application does not properly validate requests and user inputs.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    \n    cwe352 -->|ENABLES| cwe79\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe352 primary\n    class cwe79 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **CWE-352 (CSRF)**. An attacker leverages CSRF to inject malicious input, which is then stored by the application. When another user views the stored data, the injected script executes, resulting in **CWE-79 (XSS)**.\n\nCSRF (Root Cause) -> Improper Input Handling -> Stored XSS (Impact)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary vulnerability is clearly **CWE-352 (CSRF)**, as indicated by the vulnerability description and the CVE reference summary, which states, \"The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).\" The description also mentions Stored XSS, which is a consequence of the CSRF vulnerability if the application **does not properly neutralize input**. The evidence is strong, and the retriever results support these findings, with **CWE-352** and **CWE-79** being highly ranked.\nThe **CSRF** allows for the injection of malicious content which is not properly neutralized and results in **CWE-79 (XSS)**.\n\nThe chosen CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. **CWE-352** is a compound weakness that accurately reflects the CSRF vulnerability, and **CWE-79** is a base weakness that captures the XSS aspect.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.\n\n\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web server receives a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
