Any user (even guests) can create these docs, even if they dont exist already. This can enable guest users to denature the structure of wiki pages, by creating 1000s of pages with random name, that then become very difficult to handle by admins. Version 1.2.4 fixes the issue.

While it would be ideal to identify a more specific Base or Variant CWE, the provided information doesn't allow for a more granular classification. CWE-425 (Direct Request) is a ChildOf CWE-862, but the description focuses on the **missing authorization** check rather than direct access.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe425[\"CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\"]\n    \n    cwe425 -->|CHILDOF| cwe862\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe425 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authorization** check (CWE-862). This allows unauthenticated users to create arbitrary wiki pages, leading to a potential denial-of-service impact. The chain is relatively simple: Missing Authorization -> Arbitrary Page Creation -> Potential DoS.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE identified is CWE-862 (Missing Authorization). This is based on the evidence that the URL Shortener component does not check if a page exists before creating a short URL object for it, enabling unauthenticated users to create arbitrary wiki pages. This clearly indicates a **missing authorization** check, allowing unauthorized access to a critical function (creating pages).\n\nThe retriever results also support this with CWE-862 being a top candidate.\n\nThe relationship graph shows the connection between CWE-862 and other related CWEs. While a more specific CWE like CWE-425 (Direct Request) could be considered, the core issue is the **lack of an authorization** check.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
