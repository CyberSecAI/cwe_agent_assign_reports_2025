## Vulnerability Description
application-urlshortener create shortened URLs for XWiki pages. Versions prior to 1.2.4 are vulnerable to users with view access being able to create arbitrary pages. Any user (even guests) can create these docs, even if they dont exist already. This can enable guest users to denature the structure of wiki pages, by creating 1000s of pages with random name, that then become very difficult to handle by admins. Version 1.2.4 fixes the issue. No known workarounds are available.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
