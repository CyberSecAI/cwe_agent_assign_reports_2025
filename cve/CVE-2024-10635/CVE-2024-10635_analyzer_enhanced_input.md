# Vulnerability Description

    Enterprise Protection contains an improper **input validation vulnerability** in attachment defense that allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to bypass attachment scanning security policy by sending a malicious S/MIME attachment with an opaque signature. When opened by a recipient in a downstream email client, the malicious attachment could cause partial loss of integrity and confidentiality to their system.

    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis

    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'input validation vulnerability'

Relevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:

### 1. CWE-356: Product UI does not Warn User of Unsafe Actions (Score: 335.57)

The product's user interface does not warn the user before undertaking an unsafe action on behalf of that user. This makes it easier for attackers to trick users into inflicting damage to their system....

### 2. CWE-20: Improper Input Validation (Score: 327.73)

The product receives input or data, but it does
        not validate or incorrectly validates that the input has the
        properties that are required to process the data safely and
        correctly....

### 3. CWE-451: User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information (Score: 318.33)

The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as "<", ">", and "&" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages....

### 5. CWE-183: Permissive List of Allowed Inputs (Score: 307.90)

The product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are explicitly allowed by policy because the inputs are assumed to be safe, but the list is too permissive - that is, it allows an input that is unsafe, leading to resultant weaknesses....
