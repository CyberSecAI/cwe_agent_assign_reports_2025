  "description": "EspoCRM is an Open Source Customer Relationship Management software. Prior to version 9.0.7, users can be sorted by their password hash. This flaw allows an attacker to make assumptions about the hash values of other users stored in the password column of the user table, based on the results of the sorted list of users. Although unlikely, if an attacker knows the hash value of their password, they can change the password and repeat the sorting until the other users password hash is fully revealed. This issue is patched in version 9.0.7.",

  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-32789 based on provided content:\n\nThe provided content details a security vulnerability in EspoCRM, specifically related to sorting users by their password hash. This directly relates to CVE-2025-32789 as indicated by the \"CVE ID\" section within the advisory. The content provides significantly more detail than a typical CVE description.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from allowing users to be sorted by their password hash in the user management functionality. This allows an attacker to infer information about other users' password hashes by observing the sort order.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **Insecure Sorting:** The ability to sort users by the `password` field.\n*   **Information Leakage:**  The sorting mechanism leaks information about the relative order of password hashes.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   **Potential Password Cracking:** While the Bcrypt hashing algorithm with salts makes direct password recovery difficult, the sorted order provides clues that could aid in cracking attempts.\n*   **Account Takeover:**  If an attacker can determine enough information about a victim's password hash, they could potentially crack it and gain access to the account.\n*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Although the advisory states that only the password column is directly affected, it notes the potential for future expansion of the `user` table to include other sensitive data.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   An attacker with a regular or admin user account can exploit this vulnerability.\n*   The attack is performed through the user sorting functionality within the EspoCRM interface.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   The attacker needs to have a valid user account (regular or admin).\n*   The attacker needs to be able to access the user management interface.\n*   The attacker needs to understand the implications of sorting by password hash.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   The vulnerability was patched in version 9.0.7 of EspoCRM.\n*   The fix likely involves disabling sorting by the `password` field or implementing stricter access controls to prevent unauthorized sorting.\n*   The code changes include disabling order functionality and preventing order by the password field. Specifically, changes were made to `application/Espo/Core/Select/Order/Applier.php` and `application/Espo/Resources/metadata/entityDefs/User.json`.\n*   A new constant `PASSWORD` was added to `application/Espo/Core/ORM/Type/FieldType.php`.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n*   The advisory explicitly states that the use of Bcrypt with salts mitigates the severity of the vulnerability, as it prevents the attacker from knowing the exact hash value of their own password.\n*   The advisory also notes that attempts to obtain other sensitive information (like API keys) were unsuccessful due to access restrictions.\n*   The provided screenshots demonstrate the vulnerability and the SQL query confirms the sorting by the password column.",

The goal was to find the most specific CWE that accurately represented the vulnerability. The retriever results suggested several Class-level CWEs related to weak authentication and credential protection, but the specific issue of leaking information through sorting led to the selection of CWE-201. The graph relationships primarily highlighted potential follow-on weaknesses (CanFollow), which were considered but not deemed primary to the initial weakness.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **insecure** implementation that allows sorting by password hash, leading to the disclosure of sensitive information (relative order of hashes), which could potentially lead to account takeover if an attacker can crack the revealed hashes.\n  - Root Cause: **Insecure** sorting implementation.\n  - Weakness: Information leakage through sorting by password hash.\n  - Impact: Potential account takeover.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the analysis considered CWEs related to weak authentication and password hashing, as suggested by the retriever results. However, the core issue is the disclosure of sensitive information through the ability to sort users by their password hash. This makes CWE-201 a more accurate fit. The evidence for this is the vulnerability description stating, \"users can be sorted by their password hash. This flaw allows an attacker to make assumptions about the hash values of other users stored in the password column of the user table, based on the results of the sorted list of users.\"\n\nThe final decision to use CWE-201 is based on its specific focus on the **insertion** of sensitive information into sent data. In this case, the \"sent data\" is the sorted list of users, and the sensitive information is the relative order of their password hashes. This aligns well with the CWE's description. The level of specificity is appropriate because it directly addresses the information leakage aspect of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following
