This flaw allows an attacker to make assumptions about the hash values of other users stored in the password column of the user table, based on the results of the sorted list of users. Although unlikely, if an attacker knows the hash value of their password, they can change the password and repeat the sorting until the other users password hash is fully revealed. This issue is patched in version 9.0.7. Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-640 CWE-863 CWE-916 CWE-201 CWE-549 CWE-328 CWE-522 CWE-836 CWE-620",
