  "description": "Nix is a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. On macOS, built-in builders (such as `builtinfetchurl`, exposed to users with `import `) were not executed in the macOS sandbox. Thus, these builders (which are running under the `nixbld*` users) had read access to world-readable paths and write access to world-writable paths outside of the sandbox. This issue is fixed in 2.18.9, 2.19.7, 2.20.9, 2.21.5, 2.22.4, 2.23.4, and 2.24.10. Note that sandboxing is not enabled by default on macOS. The Nix sandbox is not primarily intended as a security mechanism, but as an aid to improve reproducibility and purity of Nix builds. However, sandboxing *can* mitigate the impact of other security issues by limiting what parts of the host system a build has access to.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-51481:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe root cause of the vulnerability is that on macOS, built-in builders within the Nix package manager were not being executed inside the macOS sandbox environment. This allowed these builders to bypass the intended security restrictions. Specifically, the builders had read access to world-readable paths and write access to world-writable paths outside of the sandbox. They also had the ability to create new paths in the Nix store.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\nThe primary vulnerability was the lack of sandboxing for built-in builders on macOS. This resulted in a bypass of the intended security measures designed to isolate build processes. This exposed the system to potential unauthorized access to resources.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\nAn attacker exploiting this vulnerability could potentially read sensitive data from world-readable paths, modify data in world-writable paths, and create new files in the Nix store. While the Nix sandbox is not primarily a security mechanism, its absence weakens the overall security posture and can allow other vulnerabilities to be more easily exploited. The impact is rated as \"Low\" in terms of Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\nThe attack vector is local. A user able to run Nix builds would be able to execute a malicious build definition, and gain the ability to read/write outside the sandbox.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\nThe attacker needs to have the ability to execute Nix builds on a macOS system where the sandbox is not enabled or is not correctly applied to built-in builders. A low level of privileges is required (a regular user). The user also needs to trick another user into building a malicious build, since the interaction with the vulnerability is passive.\n\n**Additional details:**\nThe vulnerability was addressed by switching from using `/usr/bin/sandbox-exec` to using `libsandbox` to ensure built-in builders are executed within the sandbox. The fix includes changes to `configure.ac`, `package.nix`, `src/libstore/meson.build`, `src/libstore/package.nix`, and `src/libstore/unix/build/local-derivation-goal.cc`.  The commit associated with the fix is `597fcc98e18e3178734d06a9e7306250e8cb8d74`.\n\nThe CVSS v4 score is `CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:H/AT:P/PR:L/UI:P/VC:L/VI:L/VA:N/SC:L/SI:L/SA:N` which reflects the local attack vector, high complexity, the need for attack requirements to be present, the low privileges required, passive user interaction, and low impact for confidentiality and integrity and no impact on availability.\n\nThe weakness is linked to `CWE-20` (Improper Input Validation), `CWE-73` (External Control of File Name or Path), and `CWE-250` (Improper Preservation of Permissions).",

CWE-732 (Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource) captures the essence of the vulnerability, where the **incorrect assignment of permissions** allowed the builders to bypass the sandbox. It is a class level CWE, but I believe it best captures the root cause.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe732[\"CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\"]\n    cwe276[\"CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions\"]\n\n    cwe276 -->|CHILDOF| cwe732\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe732 primary\n    class cwe276 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **incorrect permission assignment** (CWE-732) for the built-in builders on macOS. This allows the builders to run outside the intended sandbox, leading to read access to world-readable paths and write access to world-writable paths.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nMy assessment is based primarily on the provided evidence, especially the CVE Reference Links Content Summary. The summary clearly states that the root cause is the lack of sandboxing for built-in builders on macOS, which allowed them to bypass intended security restrictions. The summary also connects the weakness to CWE-20, CWE-73, and CWE-250. However, I believe CWE-732 more accurately reflects the **incorrect permission assignment** that led to the sandbox bypass.\n\nCWE-732 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **incorrect permission assignment** that allowed the builders to operate outside the macOS sandbox. While other CWEs like CWE-22 (Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory) and CWE-59 (Improper Link Resolution Before File Access) were considered due to their high relevance scores, they did not directly capture the root cause of the vulnerability, which was the **incorrect permission assignment**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-61: UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product, when opening a file or directory, does not sufficiently account for when the file is a symbolic link that resolves to a target outside of the intended control sphere.
