  "vulnerability_info": "VulnerabilityInfo(cve_id='CVE-2024-8836', description='PDF-XChange Editor TIF File Parsing **Out-Of-Bounds Read** **Information Disclosure Vulnerability**. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of PDF-XChange Editor. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of TIF files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated object. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-24354.', key_phrases={'rootcause': 'lack of proper validation of user-supplied data', 'weakness': ['Information Disclosure Vulnerability', 'Out-Of-Bounds Read'], 'impact': ['Information Disclosure', 'disclose sensitive information', 'execute arbitrary code'], 'vector': '', 'attacker': 'remote attackers', 'product': 'PDF-XChange Editor', 'version': '', 'component': 'TIF File Parsing'}, reference_content='Based on the provided content, here\\'s a breakdown of the vulnerability:\\n\\n**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of TIF files within PDF-XChange Editor. This leads to a read operation that goes beyond the boundaries of an allocated memory object.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\\n*   **Out-of-bounds read:** The primary weakness is the ability to read data beyond the allocated memory buffer. This is triggered when processing a crafted TIF file.\\n\\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\\n*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can potentially read sensitive information from the process\\'s memory space due to the out-of-bounds read.\\n*   **Potential Code Execution (in conjunction with other vulnerabilities):** The advisory mentions that this vulnerability, when combined with other vulnerabilities, can lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the current process. This suggests a possible path to more severe exploitation, but the details of the other vulnerabilities and how they can be combined is not provided in this advisory.\\n\\n**Attack Vectors:**\\n*   **Malicious TIF File:** An attacker crafts a malicious TIF file that triggers the out-of-bounds read when parsed by PDF-XChange Editor.\\n*   **User Interaction:** The target user must open the malicious TIF file or visit a malicious page that contains it for the vulnerability to be exploited.\\n\\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\\n*   **Local Access/User Level:**  The CVSS vector indicates that the attack vector is \"Local\" (`AV:L`), meaning the attacker needs to have some form of access to the user\\'s system (e.g., getting the user to download and open a file). The privilege required is \"None\" (`PR:N`), meaning they don\\'t need special user privileges. \\n*   **User Interaction:** User interaction is required.\\n\\n**Additional Notes:**\\n*   The vulnerability is fixed in version 10.3.1.387 of PDF-XChange Editor.\\n*   The vulnerability was reported to the vendor on 2024-06-05.\\n*   The advisory was released on 2024-09-17.',

This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of PDF-XChange Editor. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of TIF files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated object. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.
