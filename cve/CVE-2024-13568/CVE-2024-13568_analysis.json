CWE-552, being a Base level CWE, is more specific than CWE-200, which is a Class level CWE. The vulnerability involves direct access to files, making CWE-552 a more precise fit.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe552[\"CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe552 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe552 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **sensitive information** being stored in a publicly accessible directory. This leads directly to **exposure of sensitive information** to unauthorized actors, specifically allowing unauthenticated attackers to extract data.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment strongly pointed towards **CWE-552 Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties**, as the vulnerability description clearly states that sensitive data is stored insecurely in a publicly accessible directory (`/wp-content/uploads/fluent-support`). This aligns directly with the description of CWE-552.\n\nThe evidence supporting this assessment is: \"This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to extract **sensitive data** stored insecurely in the /wp-content/uploads/fluent-support directory which can contain file attachments included in support tickets.\"\n\nWhile **CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor** was also considered, it is a more general class of weakness. The MITRE mapping guidance discourages using CWE-200 when more specific options are available. Given the clear indication of files being directly accessible, CWE-552 is the more appropriate and specific choice. The retriever results also listed CWE-552 and CWE-200. CWE-552 had a higher score and base level, increasing confidence in the choice.\n\nThe final decision to prioritize CWE-552 is based on its direct relevance to the vulnerability description and the guidance to select the most specific CWE available.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this
