  "reference_content": "CVE-2024-56921: PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval\n\nThe provided content details a crash in the open5gs AMF (Access and Mobility Management Function) due to incorrect handling of UE (User Equipment) registration requests. Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\n*   Lack of proper handling in the `gmm_state_exception` function for scenarios where multiple registration requests from the same UE arrive before the AUSF (Authentication Server Function) response is received. This leads to processing outdated authentication vectors and incorrect states in the GMM (GMM - General Mobility Management) state machine.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Incorrect state management in the AMF during UE registration.\n*   Improper handling of asynchronous responses (from AUSF) in relation to multiple registration requests.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   AMF crash, potentially leading to denial of service.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Sending continuous registration requests from the same UE while the previous context is released before the AUSF response is received. This can be achieved by repeatedly initiating registration attempts.\n*   The provided script automates this process.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   An attacker needs to be able to control a UE and send registration requests to the network. No special privileges are required beyond the ability to initiate a registration procedure.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   The issue report suggests adding appropriate handling in the `gmm_state_exception` function (located in `src/amf/gmm-sm.c`) to address the scenario where multiple registration requests occur before the AUSF response.\n*   The commit message in the first content snippet states that the commit addresses this issue: \"[AMF] Fix crash due to incorrect handling of UE registration requests\". The diff shows added code to handle the Nausf\\_UEAuthentication\\_Authenticate response and ignore SBI messages in certain cases.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n*   The vulnerability was found in open5gs version v2.7.2.\n*   The issue is reproducible using UERANSIM v3.2.6.\n*   The provided PCAP log and logs from v2.7.2 can aid in further analysis.\n*   The issue is related to 3GPP TS 33.501 V18.6.0 (2024-07) specification.\n\nThis content provides significantly more detail than a typical CVE description, including specific code locations, reproduction steps, and logs.",

CWE-754, as a Class, is more specific than CWE-703 (Pillar) and potentially more applicable than CWE-755 (Class), since CWE-755 is too generic and does not focus on the checking aspect as much as CWE-754. The vulnerability involves **incorrect error handling**, which translates to improper checking or handling of exceptional conditions. Therefore, CWE-754 is preferred due to its more specific focus on checking for unusual conditions.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe754[\"CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions\"]\n    cwe755[\"CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\"]\n    cwe703[\"CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions\"]\n    cwe754 -->|CHILDOF| cwe755\n    cwe755 -->|CHILDOF| cwe703\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe754 primary\n    class cwe755,cwe703 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **incorrect error handling** of `gmm_state_exception()` upon receiving the `Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate` response, which leads to an AMF crash.\n\nRoot Cause: **Incorrect error handling** (CWE-754).\nImpact: AMF crash, potentially leading to denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on the **incorrect error handling** within the `gmm_state_exception()` function. The provided evidence from the CVE reference link content summary specifically states that the root cause involves a lack of proper handling of scenarios where multiple registration requests arrive before the AUSF response, leading to processing outdated authentication vectors and incorrect states.\n\nThe selection of CWE-754 is based on the vulnerability description key phrases and the CVE reference summary. The key phrase explicitly mentions \"**incorrect error handling**,\" which aligns directly with CWE-754's description of \"The product does not check or incorrectly checks for unusual or exceptional conditions.\" The CVE reference summary further details the improper handling of asynchronous responses and incorrect state management.\n\nCWE-755 was considered but deemed too general. While the vulnerability does involve improper handling of an exceptional condition, the root cause is more specifically related to the check or lack thereof for these conditions, making CWE-754 a more accurate representation.\n\nCWE-703 was considered, but it is a Pillar and therefore too high-level.\n\nThe evidence strongly supports the selection of CWE-754 as the primary CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
