# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-57079

## Vulnerability Description
A **prototype pollution** in the lib.deepMerge function of @zag-js/core v0.50.0 allows attackers to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) via supplying a crafted payload.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **component:** lib.deepMerge function
- **vector:** crafted payload
- **weakness:** **prototype pollution**
- **product:** @zag-js/core
- **impact:** Denial of Service, DoS
- **attacker:** attackers
- **version:** v0.50.0

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability is due to the use of `lib.deepMerge` function in `@zag-js/core` version 0.5.0, which is susceptible to Prototype Pollution.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
Prototype Pollution - An attacker can supply a payload with `Object.prototype` setter to introduce or modify properties within the global prototype chain.

Impact of exploitation:
- Denial of Service (DoS)
- Potential for other injection-based attacks if the polluted property propagates to sensitive Node.js APIs (e.g., exec, eval), enabling arbitrary command execution.

Attack vectors:
Supply a malicious payload with `Object.prototype` setter to the `lib.deepMerge` function.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
An attacker needs to be able to control the input to the `lib.deepMerge` function.

Mitigation or fix:
The advisory does not specify a fix, but implies updating the package would resolve the issue.
