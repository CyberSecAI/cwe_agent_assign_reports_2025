# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-1786

## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability was found in rizinorg rizin up to 0.7.4. It has been rated as critical. This issue affects the function msf_stream_directory_free in the library /librz/bin/pdb/pdb.c. The manipulation of the argument -P leads to buffer overflow. Local access is required to approach this attack. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. Upgrading to version 0.8.0 is able to address this issue. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component.

- **product:** rizinorg rizin
- **attacker:** local access
- **version:** up to 0.7.4

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-1786 Content

Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to a potential vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2025-1786 (PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval)

**Relevance:** The content *is* relevant as it details a crash in the `rizin` disassembler, specifically within the PDB (Program Database) parsing functionality. While not directly linked to a CVE ID initially, the details suggest a potential security vulnerability.

**Extracted Information:**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** A segmentation fault occurs when processing a PDB file with the `-P` option in `rz-bin`. The crash happens within the `msf_stream_directory_free` function in `librz/bin/pdb/pdb.c`.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability appears to be a memory safety issue (specifically a segmentation fault) within the PDB parsing code. The error message "Hint: address points to the zero page" suggests a potential use-after-free or similar memory corruption issue.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** The immediate impact is a denial of service (crash of the `rz-bin` tool).  Depending on the nature of the memory corruption, it *could* potentially lead to arbitrary code execution, but this is not explicitly stated in the provided content.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is providing a specially crafted PDB file (`poc.zip`) to the `rz-bin` tool with the `-P` option.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to create or obtain a malicious PDB file and execute the `rz-bin` tool on a system where it is installed.
*   **Mitigation or fix:** A pull request (#4960) is mentioned as closing the issue, suggesting a fix has been proposed or implemented.

**Additional Details (More than official CVE description):**

*   The crash occurs on Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS with `rizin` version 0.8.0.
*   The commit hash at the time of the report was `309f574`.
*   The AddressSanitizer (ASan) detected the segmentation fault, providing a stack trace pinpointing the location of the crash.
*   The issue is labeled as a "blocker" and "crash" indicating its severity.

**Note:** This analysis is based solely on the provided content. A full vulnerability assessment would require further investigation and analysis of the code.
