## Vulnerability Description
Netgear R7000 1.0.11.136 is vulnerable to Command Injection in RMT_invite.cgi via device_name2 parameter.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **command injection**
- **product:** Netgear R7000
- **version:** 1.0.11.136
- **component:** RMT_invite.cgi

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is a post-authentication command injection flaw present in the NETGEAR R7000 router.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The router's software allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Full Control of Router:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands, leading to complete control of the affected device.
- **Data Exfiltration/Modification:** An attacker can potentially exfiltrate sensitive information, modify device settings, or use the router as a pivot point for further attacks on the network.
- **Denial of Service:** The attacker may also be able to render the router inoperable by running resource-intensive commands.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker requires access to the network. This can be achieved through WiFi or a physical Ethernet connection.
- **Authentication:** The attacker must possess valid administrator credentials (username and password) for the router.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the affected device, meaning they would have to be within the WiFi range or connected to the local network through ethernet.
- **Administrative Credentials:** The attacker needs the router's admin username and password. This can be achieved by social engineering, brute-forcing credentials or other methods of compromising the login.

**Additional Notes:**
- The advisory provides a CVSS score of 8.4 (High) with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H, indicating a significant risk.
- NETGEAR recommends updating to firmware version 1.0.11.216 or later to mitigate the vulnerability.
- The advisory also mentions that the vulnerability was reported by "Communications Security Establishment, CSE" and "Security Research Centre, Concordia University"
