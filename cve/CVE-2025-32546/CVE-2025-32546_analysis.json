  "reference_content": "CVE-2025-32546 relates to a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the All push notification for WP plugin. Here's a breakdown of the information provided:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability allows a malicious actor to force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\nCross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) - specifically, a lack of CSRF protection.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\nA malicious actor can force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions. The specific impact varies case by case.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\nThe attack vector is through Cross-Site Request Forgery.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\nUnauthenticated attacker.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n*   Patchstack has issued a virtual patch to mitigate the issue.\n*   Remove and replace the software, as it is likely abandoned and will not receive further updates.\n*   Deactivating the software does not remove the threat unless a vPatch is deployed.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n*   **Affected versions:** <= 1.5.3\n*   **Fixed version:** N/A (as of the report date)\n*   **CVSS score:** 7.1 (Medium)\n*   **OWASP Top 10:** A1: Broken Access Control\n*   **Reported by:** 0xd4rk5id3\n*   **First reported:** December 5, 2024\n*   **Published by Patchstack:** April 14, 2025\n\nThe content provides more detail than the placeholder CVE description, specifically outlining the vulnerability type, impact, and mitigation strategies.",
