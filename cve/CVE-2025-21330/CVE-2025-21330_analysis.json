The description indicates that the vulnerability leads to a denial of service, which directly aligns with the impact described in CWE-400.\n\nThe confidence level is moderate (0.7) due to the limited information available. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section is marked as \"UNRELATED,\" which means there is no further rootcause or weakness mechanism information available. The vulnerability description key phrases also do not directly specify the root cause, only the impacted product and impact. Without more details about the specific flaw that leads to the uncontrolled resource consumption, a more precise CWE assignment is not possible.\n\nThe retriever results listed other CWEs, but these were rejected because they did not directly address the denial-of-service aspect described in the vulnerability. Specifically:\n\n*   CWE-923, CWE-295, CWE-732, CWE-184, CWE-502, CWE-379, CWE-250 and CWE-328 were deemed less relevant as they cover issues like communication channel restrictions, certificate validation, permission assignments, input validation, deserialization, temporary file creation, privilege and weak hash usage, none of which directly indicate the DoS condition.\n*   CWE-322 (Key Exchange without Entity Authentication) has even less information.\n\nThe selection of CWE-400 is at the class level because there is no information to suggest a more specific variant. The evidence is limited to the vulnerability description indicating a denial-of-service condition.",
