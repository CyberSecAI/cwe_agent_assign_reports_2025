# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-45752

## Vulnerability Description
logiops through 0.3.4, in its default configuration, allows any unprivileged user to configure its logid daemon via an unrestricted D-Bus service, including setting malicious keyboard macros. This allows for privilege escalation with minimal user interaction.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** privilege escalation
- **vector:** unrestricted D-Bus service
- **attacker:** unprivileged user
- **product:** logiops
- **version:** through 0.3.4

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The `logiops` daemon, by default, exposes an unrestricted D-Bus service. This service allows any unprivileged user to configure the daemon, including setting keyboard macros.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Unrestricted D-Bus Service:** The D-Bus service lacks proper access controls, allowing any user to interact with it.
*   **Arbitrary Key Remapping:** The service allows users to remap keys to arbitrary actions, including shell commands or other malicious sequences.
*   **Privilege Escalation:**  Although it requires user interaction, it can be exploited to gain elevated privileges through malicious key remappings.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary command execution:** An attacker can remap keys to execute shell commands, potentially gaining control of the system.
*   **Malicious macros:**  Attackers could configure keyboard macros to perform malicious actions, possibly targeting specific software or actions within the system.
*   **System compromise:**  By gaining the ability to execute arbitrary commands, an attacker can potentially compromise the entire system.
*   **Data exfiltration or modification:** An attacker could use key remappings to steal sensitive data or modify system settings.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Local D-Bus Service:** The vulnerability is exploited through the D-Bus service exposed by `logiops`.
*   **User Interaction:** Although the exploit requires user interaction, this is fairly minimal. For instance, a malicious configuration could trigger when a user types a specific key combination.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Local User Access:** The attacker needs to be a local user on the system where `logiops` is running.
*   **Knowledge of the D-Bus API:** The attacker needs knowledge of the `logiops` D-Bus API to craft the malicious requests, as demonstrated by the provided python POC script.
* **User interaction**: The attacker needs the user to press keys or use the mouse after the malicious remapping has occurred.

**Additional Details:**

*   The bug report includes a proof-of-concept Python script (`logiops-dbus-poc.py`) that demonstrates how to exploit the vulnerability by assigning shell commands to all buttons on connected peripherals.
*   The vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2024-45752.
*   The vulnerability is described as allowing for privilege escalation with user interaction.
*   The CVSS score is: CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:P/PR:L/UI:P/VC:L/VI:H/VA:L/SC:H/SI:H/SA:H

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* 🔍 *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* 🔍 *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion – CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### 🔸 CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ✅ *“A user created with the ‘guest’ role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ✅ *“The backup service runs as root but only needs read access.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ⚠️ This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### 🔸 CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ✅ *“User can access another user’s invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.”*

## Mapping Examples – Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *“User can escalate privileges to admin.”*
> ❌ Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged – only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ✅ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**

## Good Mapping Examples – Privileges & Permissions

* ✅ **CWE-266**: *“When a new user registers, the system assigns them admin role due to a missing role validation.”*
* ✅ **CWE-250**: *“Installer runs with system-level privileges but doesn't require them to install files in the user directory.”*
* ✅ **CWE-284**: *“Inconsistent access rules between UI and backend for sensitive endpoints.”*
* ✅ **CWE-285**: *“Authorization logic fails to restrict access to finance reports based on department.”*
