This level of specificity is appropriate because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions a **stack overflow** caused by a large input buffer. There are no direct parent-child or chain relationships that significantly influence the selection in this case, as the description is quite direct.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe121[\"CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe121 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain consists of a large input buffer leading to a stack overflow, which then causes the Suricata application to crash.\n  - The root cause is the **improper handling of a large input buffer** which causes the **stack overflow**.\n  - The impact is the **crashing of Suricata**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the clear description of the vulnerability as a **stack overflow** caused by a large input buffer, as stated in the vulnerability description and confirmed by the CVE Reference Links Content Summary. The retriever results also list CWE-121 as the top candidate.\n\nThe selection of CWE-121 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly corresponds to the described vulnerability mechanism.
