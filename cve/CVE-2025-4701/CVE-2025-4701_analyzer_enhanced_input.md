## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, has been found in VITA-MLLM Freeze-Omni up to 20250421. This issue affects the function torch.load of the file models/utils.py. The manipulation of the argument path leads to **deserialization**. It is possible to launch the attack on the local host.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **deserialization**
- **vector:** manipulation of the argument path
- **product:** VITA-MLLM Freeze-Omni
- **version:** up to 20250421
- **component:** torch.load function in models/utils.py

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-4701 Content

This content **IS RELATED** to a vulnerability described as CVE-2025-4701, specifically a deserialization of untrusted data vulnerability in `torch.load`. It provides more detail than a standard CVE description.

Here's a breakdown of the extracted information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The `torch.load` function is used without the `weights_only=True` parameter, allowing for the deserialization of arbitrary code embedded within a pickled file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data.
*   Insecure deserialization of data loaded via `torch.load`.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Arbitrary code execution.
*   Potential unauthorized access to the system.
*   Potential for other malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**

*   An attacker crafts a malicious file containing malicious pickle data.
*   The attacker tricks the victim into providing the path to the malicious file to the `torch.load` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   Ability to create a malicious pickle file.
*   Ability to influence the `path` parameter passed to `torch.load` (e.g., through file upload, network share access, or other means of file system interaction).

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   Use the `weights_only=True` parameter when calling `torch.load`:
    *   `checkpoint = torch.load(path, weights_only=True)`
    *   `checkpoint = torch.load(path, map_location='cpu', weights_only=True)`

**Impacted Version:**

*   All versions are affected. No fix is available on the latest main branch as of the report date.

**Affected Code Location:**

*   `Freeze-Omni/models/utils.py` lines 13 and 16.
