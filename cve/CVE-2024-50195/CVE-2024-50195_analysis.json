  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved posix-clock Fix **missing timespec64 check** in pc_clock_settime() As Andrew pointed out, it will make sense that the PTP core checked timespec64 structs tv_sec and tv_nsec range before calling ptp->info->settime64(). As the man manual of clock_settime() said, if tp.tv_sec is negative or tp.tv_nsec is outside the range [0..999,999,999], it should return EINVAL, which include dynamic clocks which handles PTP clock, and the condition is consistent with timespec64_valid(). As Thomas suggested, timespec64_valid() only check the timespec is valid, but not ensure that the time is in a valid range, so check it ahead using timespec64_valid_strict() in pc_clock_settime() and return -EINVAL if not valid. There are some drivers that use tp->tv_sec and tp->tv_nsec directly to write registers without validity checks and assume that the higher layer has checked it, which is dangerous and will benefit from this, such as hclge_ptp_settime(), igb_ptp_settime_i210(), _rcar_gen4_ptp_settime(), and some drivers can remove the checks of itself.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe root cause of this vulnerability is the missing validation of `timespec64` structures in the `pc_clock_settime()` function within the Linux kernel's posix-clock subsystem. Specifically, the `tv_sec` and `tv_nsec` fields of the timespec64 struct were not being checked for valid ranges before being passed to lower-level PTP (Precision Time Protocol) drivers.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n- **Lack of Input Validation:** The `pc_clock_settime` function was not performing adequate checks on the `timespec64` structure before using it. This allowed for potentially invalid or out-of-range time values to be passed down to the hardware.\n- **Reliance on Higher Layer Checks:** Some PTP drivers were directly using the `tv_sec` and `tv_nsec` values to write to hardware registers without validating them, assuming the higher layers had already done this validation.\n- **Incorrect use of `timespec64_valid()`**: The `timespec64_valid()` function only checks if the timespec is a valid struct, not whether the values it holds are within valid ranges.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Undefined Behavior:** By providing an invalid `timespec64` structure, an attacker could cause undefined behavior by writing out-of-range values to hardware registers directly. This could potentially lead to unexpected system behavior.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- The vulnerability can be exploited via the `clock_settime()` syscall, which allows a user to set a system-wide clock. If a dynamic clock using PTP is set by the user, then they can control the timespec passed to it.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **User Privileges:** An attacker would need to have sufficient privileges to call the `clock_settime()` syscall, which is typically available to most users.\n- **Target System:** The system must be using a dynamic clock utilizing PTP (Precision Time Protocol) and have a vulnerable driver.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The fix involves adding a call to `timespec64_valid_strict()` in `pc_clock_settime()` which returns an error if the timespec has invalid values.\n- The vulnerability exists because some drivers assume the higher layer performs the check, and it did not.\n- The fix will allow some drivers to remove their own checks.\n\nThis information is more detailed than a typical CVE description, as it provides context on the affected functions, data structures, and drivers involved.",

CWE-1284 is a specific type of input validation issue where the quantity specified in the input is not properly validated. This is a direct specialization of the more general **Improper Input Validation** (CWE-20). The fact that the vulnerability description explicitly mentions a \"**missing timespec64 check**\" for the `tv_sec` and `tv_nsec` fields, which represent quantities (seconds and nanoseconds), strongly supports the selection of CWE-1284.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1284[\"CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe754[\"CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions\"]\n\n    cwe1284 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    cwe754 -->|ParentOf| cwe476\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1284 primary\n    class cwe20 secondary\n    class cwe754 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing input validation** in `pc_clock_settime()`, which is the **root cause**. This leads to the possibility of invalid time values being passed to the hardware, potentially causing undefined behavior.\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Missing Input Validation** (CWE-1284) - The `timespec64` structure is not validated for valid ranges.\n2.  **Impact:** Undefined behavior due to writing out-of-range values to hardware registers.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the most specific CWE that accurately reflects the **root cause** of the vulnerability. The vulnerability description highlights the **missing timespec64 check** which is an input validation issue. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" further elaborates that the `tv_sec` and `tv_nsec` fields were not being checked for valid ranges, which are quantities, before being passed to the PTP drivers.\n\nThe selection of CWE-1284 is based on the explicit mention of a **missing validation check** for `timespec64` and the fact that it is a Base level CWE. The evidence clearly supports this classification, as the vulnerability revolves around the lack of validation of specific quantity values (seconds and nanoseconds) in the input.\n\nCWE-754 was considered because the **missing check** could be seen as an **improper check for unusual or exceptional conditions**, but it is a Class level CWE.\n\nThe selected CWE, CWE-1284, is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **root cause** of the vulnerability: the **improper validation of a specified quantity** (time values) in the input.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-208: Observable Timing Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTwo separate operations in a product require different amounts of time to complete, in a way that is observable to an actor and reveals security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1285: Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input that is expected to specify an index, position, or offset into an indexable resource such as a buffer or file, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the specified index/position/offset has the required properties.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check.
