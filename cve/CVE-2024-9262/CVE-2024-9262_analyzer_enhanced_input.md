# Vulnerability Description

    The User Meta User Profile Builder and User management plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to **Insecure Direct Object Reference** in all versions up to, and including, 3.1 via the getUser() due to **missing validation on a user controlled key**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to obtain user meta values from form fields. Please note that this requires a site administrator to create a form that displays potentially sensitive information like password hashes. This may also be exploited by unauthenticated users if the user-meta-public-profile shortcode is used insecurely.
