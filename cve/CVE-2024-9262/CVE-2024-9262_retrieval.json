This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to obtain user meta values from form fields. Please note that this requires a site administrator to create a form that displays potentially sensitive information like password hashes. This may also be exploited by unauthenticated users if the user-meta-public-profile shortcode is used insecurely.', key_phrases={'rootcause': ['Insecure Direct Object Reference', 'missing validation on a user controlled key'], 'weakness': 'insecure direct object reference', 'impact': 'obtain user meta values from form fields', 'vector': '', 'attacker': 'unauthenticated users if the user-meta-public-profile shortcode is used insecurely', 'product': 'User Meta User Profile Builder and User management plugin for WordPress', 'version': 'up to and including 3.1', 'component': 'getUser()'}, reference_content=\"Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-9262:\\n\\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\\nThe vulnerability stems from a missing validation on a user-controlled key within the `getUser()` function of the `PublicProfile.php` file in the User Meta plugin. This allows an attacker to potentially retrieve user data by manipulating the `user_email`, `user_login`, or `user_id` parameters.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\\n- **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The plugin directly uses user-supplied input (`$_REQUEST['user_email']`, `$_REQUEST['user_login']`, `$_REQUEST['user_id']`) to retrieve user information without proper authorization checks or input sanitization.\\n- **Authorization Bypass:** Authenticated users with Contributor-level access or higher can potentially obtain sensitive user meta data.\\n- **Information Exposure:** Sensitive information, including password hashes (if displayed by a site administrator via form), can be exposed.\\n\\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\\n- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Attackers can potentially access sensitive user data, including password hashes, if the site administrator created a form to display this information. This could lead to account compromise and further malicious activities.\\n- **Unauthorized Access:** By manipulating the parameters, attackers can potentially access data of users they should not have access to.\\n\\n**Attack Vectors:**\\n- **HTTP Request Parameter Manipulation:** Attackers can manipulate the `user_email`, `user_login`, or `user_id` parameters within HTTP requests to access arbitrary user profiles.\\n- **Shortcode Exploitation:** Unauthenticated users can potentially exploit this vulnerability if the `user-meta-public-profile` shortcode is used insecurely.\\n\\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\\n- **Authenticated User:** Attackers need to be authenticated WordPress users with Contributor-level access or higher to exploit the vulnerability.\\n- **Unauthenticated User (conditional):** Unauthenticated users can exploit the vulnerability if the `user-meta-public-profile` shortcode is used insecurely, which would require the website to implement this shortcode on a public page.\\n\\n**Additional Notes**\\nThe Wordfence report notes that this vulnerability requires a site administrator to create a form that displays potentially sensitive information.\\n\\nThe vulnerability is located in the `PublicProfile.php` file, specifically within the `getUser()` function which is located within this file in lines 28-42.\\n```php\\n 28\\tprivate function getUser()\\n 29\\t{\\n 30\\t\\tif($this->call == 'email') {\\n 31\\t\\t\\t$user_email = !empty($_REQUEST['user_email']) ? esc_attr($_REQUEST['user_email']) : '';\\n 32\\t\\t\\treturn get_user_by('email', $user_email);\\n 33\\t\\t}\\n 34\\t\\telseif ($this->call == 'username') {\\n 35\\t\\t\\t$username = !empty($_REQUEST['user_login']) ? esc_attr($_REQUEST['user_login']) : '';\\n 36\\t\\t\\treturn get_user_by('login', $username);\\n 37\\t\\t}\\n 38\\t\\telse {\\n 39\\t\\t\\t$user_id = !empty($_REQUEST['user_id']) ? esc_attr($_REQUEST['user_id']) : '';\\n 40\\t\\t\\treturn get_user_by('id', $user_id);\\n 41\\t\\t}\\n 42\\t}\\n```\\nThe plugin uses the values within the `$_REQUEST` array directly, after running them through `esc_attr()`, within calls to `get_user_by()`. The `esc_attr()` function escapes HTML attributes, it does not protect from insecure direct object references.\", similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats':

    "enhanced_query": "# Vulnerability Description\n\n    The User Meta User Profile Builder and User management plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to **Insecure Direct Object Reference** in all versions up to, and including, 3.1 via the getUser() due to **missing validation on a user controlled key**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to obtain user meta values from form fields. Please note that this requires a site administrator to create a form that displays potentially sensitive information like password hashes. This may also be exploited by unauthenticated users if the user-meta-public-profile shortcode is used insecurely.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'Insecure Direct Object Reference'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1.
