The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **sql injection**
- **vector:** manipulation of schedule_id/schedule_date/schedule_day/start_time/end_time/booking argument
- **product:** code-projects E-Health Care System
- **version:** 1
- **component:** /Doctor/user_appointment.php

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The root cause of this vulnerability is the lack of input sanitization in the `user_appointment.php` file of the E-Health Care System. Specifically, the `$booking` parameter is directly incorporated into an SQL query without any form of validation or escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. By injecting malicious SQL code into the `booking` parameter, an attacker can manipulate the SQL query being executed by the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Breach:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the database.
*   **Data Manipulation:** It's also possible for an attacker to modify or delete data within the database.
*   **Potential for Wider System Compromise:** Depending on database permissions and the specific SQL injection, attackers could potentially gain further access to the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is exploited through a crafted HTTP POST request to the `user_appointment.php` endpoint.
*   **Malicious Parameter Injection:** The attacker inserts malicious SQL code within the `booking` parameter of the POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable server.
*   **Basic Understanding of SQL Injection:**  The attacker needs to understand how to formulate SQL injection payloads.

**More Detail than CVE Description:**
*   The provided text includes a specific vulnerable file path: `Doctor/user_appointment.php`.
*   It identifies the vulnerable parameter: `booking`.
*   It provides example code snippets demonstrating the lack of filtering, and screenshots of the vulnerable code.
*   It provides a full Proof of Concept (PoC) HTTP request.
*   It details using sqlmap to verify the vulnerability and extract the current database name.
