# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-4123

# Vulnerability Description

    A **cross-site scripting** (**XSS**) vulnerability exists in Grafana caused by combining a client **path traversal** and **open redirect**. This allows attackers to redirect users to a website that hosts a frontend plugin that will execute arbitrary JavaScript. This vulnerability does not require editor permissions and if anonymous access is enabled, the **XSS** will work. If the Grafana Image Renderer plugin is installed, it is possible to exploit the **open redirect** to achieve a full read SSRF. The default Content-Security-Policy (CSP) in Grafana will block the **XSS** though the `connect-src` directive.
