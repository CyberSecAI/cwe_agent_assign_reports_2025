## Vulnerability Description
A boolean-based **SQL injection** issue in the Virtual Meeting Password (VMP) endpoint in R-HUB TurboMeeting through 8.x allows unauthenticated remote attackers to extract hashed passwords from the database, and authenticate to the application, via crafted SQL input.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **SQL injection**
- **impact:** extract hashed passwords
- **vector:** crafted SQL input
- **attacker:** unauthenticated remote attackers
- **product:** R-HUB TurboMeeting
- **version:** through 8.x
- **component:** Virtual Meeting Password (VMP) endpoint

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Boolean-based SQL Injection

**Root Cause:** The "RHUB TurboMeeting" web application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries. Specifically, it removes some characters (semicolon, dash, underscore, space) from the `meeting_id` parameter before adding it to an SQLite query, but this sanitization is insufficient to prevent SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The application attempts to sanitize the `meeting_id` parameter but does not adequately prevent SQL injection. The removal of certain characters is not sufficient.
*   **Direct Use of User Input in SQL Query:** The application directly uses the unsanitized `meeting_id` parameter within a SQL query, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Exposure:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially gaining access to sensitive data stored in the database, such as user credentials (in this case, the admin's password hash).
*   **Data Modification or Deletion:** An attacker may also be able to modify or delete data within the database.
*   **Database Disruption:** An attacker could potentially disrupt the normal operations of the database.
*   **Compromise of the Server:**  Combined with other vulnerabilities (Insecure Password Reset and Command Injection in Certificate Signing Request) an attacker can authenticate as admin and achieve remote command execution as root.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exposed over the network through HTTP requests to the `/as/wapi/vmp` endpoint.
*   **HTTP POST Request:**  The attacker sends a POST request to the vulnerable endpoint with a crafted `meeting_id` parameter containing SQL injection payloads.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   **HTTP Request Knowledge:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable endpoint and how to craft HTTP POST requests.
*   **SQL Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of SQL syntax to create effective injection payloads.

**Technical Details:**
*   The vulnerability is in the `meeting_id` parameter of the `/as/wapi/vmp` endpoint.
*   The application removes `;`, `-`, `_`, and ` ` (space) from the `meeting_id` parameter.
*   The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) uses boolean-based injection by using `/**/` as a replacement for spaces.
*   The PoC script uses a series of queries to extract the admin's password hash character by character. The example query is:

    ```
    1'/**/OR/**/1=2/**/UNION/**/select/**/password/**/from/**/employee/**/where/**/email='admin'/**/AND/**/substr(password,{i},1)='{char}'/**
    ```
**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is rated as **Critical** with a CVSS score of 9.8.
*   The affected versions are all versions `<= 8.x`.
*   There is no patch available at the time of this report.
*   The suggested fix is to use prepared statements with parameterized queries or proper escaping functions.
*   The vulnerability is tracked as CVE-2024-38289 and is associated with CWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command).
