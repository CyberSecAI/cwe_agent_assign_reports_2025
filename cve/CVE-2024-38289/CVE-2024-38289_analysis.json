  },
  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Vulnerability:** Boolean-based SQL Injection\n\n**Root Cause:** The \"RHUB TurboMeeting\" web application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries. Specifically, it removes some characters (semicolon, dash, underscore, space) from the `meeting_id` parameter before adding it to an SQLite query, but this sanitization is insufficient to prevent SQL injection.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The application attempts to sanitize the `meeting_id` parameter but does not adequately prevent SQL injection. The removal of certain characters is not sufficient.\n*   **Direct Use of User Input in SQL Query:** The application directly uses the unsanitized `meeting_id` parameter within a SQL query, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n*   **Data Exposure:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially gaining access to sensitive data stored in the database, such as user credentials (in this case, the admin's password hash).\n*   **Data Modification or Deletion:** An attacker may also be able to modify or delete data within the database.\n*   **Database Disruption:** An attacker could potentially disrupt the normal operations of the database.\n*   **Compromise of the Server:**  Combined with other vulnerabilities (Insecure Password Reset and Command Injection in Certificate Signing Request) an attacker can authenticate as admin and achieve remote command execution as root.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exposed over the network through HTTP requests to the `/as/wapi/vmp` endpoint.\n*   **HTTP POST Request:**  The attacker sends a POST request to the vulnerable endpoint with a crafted `meeting_id` parameter containing SQL injection payloads.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server hosting the vulnerable application.\n*   **HTTP Request Knowledge:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable endpoint and how to craft HTTP POST requests.\n*   **SQL Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of SQL syntax to create effective injection payloads.\n\n**Technical Details:**\n*   The vulnerability is in the `meeting_id` parameter of the `/as/wapi/vmp` endpoint.\n*   The application removes `;`, `-`, `_`, and ` ` (space) from the `meeting_id` parameter.\n*   The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) uses boolean-based injection by using `/**/` as a replacement for spaces.\n*   The PoC script uses a series of queries to extract the admin's password hash character by character. The example query is:\n\n    ```\n    1'/**/OR/**/1=2/**/UNION/**/select/**/password/**/from/**/employee/**/where/**/email='admin'/**/AND/**/substr(password,{i},1)='{char}'/**\n    ```\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n*   The vulnerability is rated as **Critical** with a CVSS score of 9.8.\n*   The affected versions are all versions `<= 8.x`.\n*   There is no patch available at the time of this report.\n*   The suggested fix is to use prepared statements with parameterized queries or proper escaping functions.\n*   The vulnerability is tracked as CVE-2024-38289 and is associated with CWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command).\n\nThe provided content gives a very detailed explanation of the vulnerability, the proof of concept and the severity of the exploit.",
