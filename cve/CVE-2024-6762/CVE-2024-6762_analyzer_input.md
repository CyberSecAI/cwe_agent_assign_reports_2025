# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-6762

## Vulnerability Description
Jetty PushSessionCacheFilter can be exploited by unauthenticated users to launch remote DoS attacks by exhausting the servers memory.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** denial of service and remote DoS
- **vector:** exhausting the servers memory
- **attacker:** unauthenticated users
- **product:** Jetty PushSessionCacheFilter

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-6762:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `PushSessionCacheFilter` in Jetty allows unauthenticated users to create sessions which can consume server memory. An attacker can exploit this by sending numerous requests, each creating a new session, eventually leading to memory exhaustion.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Uncontrolled resource consumption: The `PushSessionCacheFilter` creates a session for every request, without proper limits, leading to potential memory exhaustion.
- Lack of proper session management: The filter does not effectively manage the number of sessions it creates, nor are there safeguards to prevent excessive session creation by unauthenticated users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): An attacker can cause the server to become unresponsive due to memory exhaustion, preventing legitimate users from accessing the service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely, without needing physical access to the server.
- Attack Complexity: High. While the attack is simple in principle, it requires a high degree of coordination, rate, and duration to exhaust the server memory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need any special privileges or user interaction on the server. They only need network access to the affected server.
- The attacker needs to be able to send multiple requests to the server to cause memory exhaustion.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability exists in `org.eclipse.jetty:jetty-servlets` versions >=10.0.0, <=10.0.17, >=11.0.0, <=11.0.17, and >=12.0.0, <=12.0.3.
- Patched versions include 10.0.18, 11.0.18, and 12.0.4.
- The `PushCacheFilter` was also deprecated and removed because of similar issues.
- Workarounds include disabling `PushCacheFilter`, reducing the idle timeout for unauthenticated sessions, or configuring session passivation to store sessions in a database or file system rather than in memory.
