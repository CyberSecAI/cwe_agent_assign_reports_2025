# Analysis for CVE-2025-26849

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-321 | Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key | 1.0 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE. Matches the root cause directly. |
| CWE-312 | Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The hardcoded key leads to potential decryption of sensitive info. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that influenced the decision was the direct match of **CWE-321** to the vulnerability description's root cause of a **Hard-coded Cryptographic Key**. While **CWE-798** Use of Hard-coded Credentials is a parent of **CWE-321**, the evidence is specific to a cryptographic key, making the variant **CWE-321** the better choice. **CWE-312** Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information is a potential consequence of using the hardcoded key, as it allows for decryption of sensitive data.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **Hard-coded Cryptographic Key (CWE-321)**, which allows for the decryption of inventory files, potentially leading to **Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information (CWE-312)**.

## Summary of Analysis
The primary assessment is based on the direct evidence from the vulnerability description stating a "**Hard-coded Cryptographic Key**" is the root cause. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" section confirms this by stating, "The Docusnap client software encrypts inventory files with a static AES key for Windows systems and a hardcoded RSA private key for Linux systems." This aligns perfectly with **CWE-321**. The graph relationships show that **CWE-321** is a child of **CWE-798**, but **CWE-321** is more specific. The relationship to **CWE-312** indicates a potential impact.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because **CWE-321** directly addresses the **root cause** of the vulnerability.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The use of a hard-coded cryptographic key significantly increases the possibility that encrypted data may be recovered.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).



## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.
