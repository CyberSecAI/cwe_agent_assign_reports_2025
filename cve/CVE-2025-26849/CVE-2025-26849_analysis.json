The decryption key can be obtained from the .NET application, downloadable from the vendor\u2019s website.\n\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities present:\n*   Information Disclosure: Inventory files created by Docusnap, containing information like installed programs, firewall rules and local administrators, are encrypted with a static key.\n\nImpact of exploitation:\n*   Attackers with read access to Docusnap inventory files are able to decrypt its contents. This discloses information that can be used for further attacks.\n\nAttack vectors:\n*   The vulnerability can be exploited by any domain user who has read access to the encrypted inventory files, as Docusnap recommends giving modify permissions to the AD group \u201cAuthenticated Users.\u201d Since modify permissions include read permissions, this means every domain user has access to the encrypted inventory files.\n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position:\n*   An attacker needs read access to the encrypted inventory files.\n\nMitigation or fix:\n*   The ACL of the file share should be adjusted to prevent read access to the inventory files created on other computers.\n*   Attackers should not be able read the clear text inventory files. This can for example be achieved by using an asymmetric encryption method with unique keys for each installation. Another option would be to prevent users from reading the inventory files.\n```",

The hardcoded key leads to potential decryption of sensitive info. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship that influenced the decision was the direct match of **CWE-321** to the vulnerability description's root cause of a **Hard-coded Cryptographic Key**. While **CWE-798** Use of Hard-coded Credentials is a parent of **CWE-321**, the evidence is specific to a cryptographic key, making the variant **CWE-321** the better choice. **CWE-312** Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information is a potential consequence of using the hardcoded key, as it allows for decryption of sensitive data.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe321[\"CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key\"]\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    \n    cwe321 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n    cwe321 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe312\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe321 primary\n    class cwe312,cwe798 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **Hard-coded Cryptographic Key (CWE-321)**, which allows for the decryption of inventory files, potentially leading to **Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information (CWE-312)**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary assessment is based on the direct evidence from the vulnerability description stating a \"**Hard-coded Cryptographic Key**\" is the root cause. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section confirms this by stating, \"The Docusnap client software encrypts inventory files with a static AES key for Windows systems and a hardcoded RSA private key for Linux systems.\" This aligns perfectly with **CWE-321**.
