# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-36399

## Vulnerability Description
Kanboard is project management software that focuses on the Kanban methodology. The vuln is in app/Controller/ProjectPermissionController.php function addUser(). The **users permission to add users to a project only get checked on the URL parameter project_id**. If the user is authorized to add users to this project the request gets processed. The users permission for the POST BODY parameter project_id does not get checked again while processing. An attacker with the Project Manager on a single project may take over any other project. The vulnerability is fixed in 1.2.37.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **users permission to add users to a project only get checked on the URL parameter project_id**
- **weakness:** **not properly validating user permissions**
- **impact:** take over any other project
- **vector:** crafted request to addUser() function
- **attacker:** attacker with Project Manager role
- **product:** Kanboard
- **version:** prior to 1.2.37
- **component:** app/Controller/ProjectPermissionController.php function addUser()

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) in the `ProjectPermissionController.php` file, specifically within the `addUser()` function. The application only checks the user's permission to add users based on the `project_id` in the URL parameters. However, it fails to re-verify the user's permission based on the `project_id` provided in the POST request body. This allows an attacker to manipulate the project ID in the request body to gain access to projects they are not authorized to manage.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference):** The application uses the `project_id` parameter directly without proper authorization checks based on the body parameter.
*   **Missing CSRF Check (in original report):** Although not the root cause of the IDOR, the original report also mentioned that the `addUser()` function does not verify the CSRF token, but the provided patch does address this.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Project Takeover:** An attacker with "Project Manager" role on one project can gain full control over any other project.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Access to sensitive information in projects the attacker should not have access to.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Ability to change user access, delete/edit tickets, delete projects, etc.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack can be performed remotely over the network
*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** An attacker modifies the `project_id` parameter in the POST request body via a proxy (e.g., Burp Suite)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low Privileges:** The attacker needs to have a "Project Manager" role on at least one project.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application.
*   **HTTP Interception:** The attacker would ideally use a proxy to intercept and modify the POST request.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided commit fixes the vulnerability by adding a CSRF check and removing the `project_id` form value. The CSRF check was missing in the original version.
*   The vulnerability is present in versions `<= 1.2.36` and is fixed in version `>= 1.2.37`.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set ‚Äì Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* üîç *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* üîç *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion ‚Äì CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### üî∏ CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ‚úÖ *‚ÄúA user created with the ‚Äòguest‚Äô role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.‚Äù*

#### üî∏ CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ‚úÖ *‚ÄúThe backup service runs as root but only needs read access.‚Äù*

#### üî∏ CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### üî∏ CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ‚úÖ *‚ÄúUser can access another user‚Äôs invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.‚Äù*

## Mapping Examples ‚Äì Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *‚ÄúUser can escalate privileges to admin.‚Äù*
> ‚ùå Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged ‚Äì only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ‚úÖ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**
