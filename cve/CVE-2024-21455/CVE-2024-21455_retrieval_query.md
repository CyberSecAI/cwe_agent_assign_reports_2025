    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis
    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. 
    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.

    ## WEAKNESS: 'Memory corruption'

Relevant CWEs for this WEAKNESS:

### 1. CWE-782: Exposed IOCTL with Insufficient Access Control (Score: 165.40)

The product implements an IOCTL with functionality that should be restricted, but it does not properly enforce access control for the IOCTL....

### 2. CWE-667: Improper Locking (Score: 155.64)

The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors....

### 3. CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write (Score: 154.66)

The product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer....

### 4. CWE-394: Unexpected Status Code or Return Value (Score: 151.89)

The product does not properly check when a function or operation returns a value that is legitimate for the function, but is not expected by the product....

### 5. CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size (Score: 146.89)

The product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow....

## WEAKNESS: 'race condition'

Relevant CWEs for this WEAKNESS:

### 1. CWE-782: Exposed IOCTL with Insufficient Access Control (Score: 165.40)

The product implements an IOCTL with functionality that should be restricted, but it does not properly enforce access control for the IOCTL....

### 2. CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') (Score: 156.53)

The product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently....

### 3. CWE-667: Improper Locking (Score: 155.64)

The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors....

### 4. CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition (Score: 143.29)

The product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check. This can cause the product to perform invalid actions when the resource is in an unexpected state....

### 5. CWE-364: Signal Handler Race Condition (Score: 137.44)

The product uses a signal handler that introduces a race condition....
