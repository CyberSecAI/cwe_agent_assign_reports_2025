# Vulnerability Description

    Improper **Input Validation vulnerability** in Apache Kvrocks. The SETRANGE command didnt check if the `offset` input is a positive integer and use it as an index of a string. So it will cause the server to crash due to its index is out of range. This issue affects Apache Kvrocks through 2.11.1. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.12.0, which fixes the issue.
