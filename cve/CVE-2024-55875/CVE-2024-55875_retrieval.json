Prior to version 5.41.0.0, there is a potential **XXE** (XML External Entity Injection) vulnerability when http4k handling malicious XML contents within requests, which might allow attackers to read local sensitive information on server, trigger **Server-side Request Forgery** and even execute code under some circumstances. Version 5.41.0.0 contains a patch for the issue.', key_phrases={'rootcause': 'improper XML parsing', 'weakness': ['Server-side Request Forgery', 'XXE'], 'impact': [\"['read local sensitive information'\", \"'server-side request forgery'\", \"'execute code']\"], 'vector': 'malicious XML contents', 'attacker': 'attackers', 'product': 'http4k', 'version': 'prior to 5.41.0.0', 'component': ''}, reference_content=\"Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2024-55875:\\n\\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\\n- The vulnerability stems from the insecure configuration of the `DocumentBuilderFactory` used for parsing XML in the `http4k` library. Specifically, the default configuration allows external entities to be resolved and expanded during XML parsing.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\\n- **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection:** The core vulnerability is the presence of an XXE injection point. The `DocumentBuilderFactory` was instantiated without disabling external entity resolution. This allowed an attacker to inject malicious XML content with references to external entities, which could then be processed by the server.\\n- The code in `Xml.kt` directly uses `DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance()` which, by default, allows external entity resolution.\\n\\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\\n- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers could potentially read local files and sensitive information on the server by exploiting the XXE vulnerability.\\n- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** Attackers could trigger SSRF by making the server perform HTTP requests to internal or external resources controlled by the attacker.\\n- **Potential Code Execution:** In specific environments, XXE vulnerabilities can potentially lead to remote code execution, although this is not a certainty, it is a risk.\\n- The provided PoC demonstrates how a malicious XML payload can cause a server to make an external request.\\n\\n**Attack Vectors:**\\n- The primary attack vector is through HTTP requests containing malicious XML payloads, sent to endpoints that use the vulnerable `http4k` XML parsing functionality.\\n\\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\\n- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server.\\n- No authentication or specific privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability.\\n- The attacker needs to know how to construct malicious XML payloads containing external entity references.\\n\\n**Additional Information:**\\n- The provided content includes a Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrating the vulnerability using a curl command that triggers an SSRF.\\n- The vulnerability was addressed by disabling external entity resolution in the `DocumentBuilderFactory` by default, using `isExpandEntityReferences = false` and setting `XMLConstants.ACCESS_EXTERNAL_DTD` and `XMLConstants.ACCESS_EXTERNAL_SCHEMA` to empty strings.\\n- The fix involved adding a `XmlParsingConfig` type and applying security settings to the `DocumentBuilderFactory`.\\n- The vulnerable code is located in `core/format/xml/src/main/kotlin/org/http4k/format/Xml.kt` in the `asXmlDocument()` function, where the `DocumentBuilderFactory` was created.\\n- The fix is available in versions `5.41.0.0` and `4.50.0.0` of `http4k`.\\n- The provided code snippet shows that the fix included a `defaultXmlParsingConfig` that disables entity expansion and external DTD and schema access, which is then used by the XML parsing methods.\\n- A test case (`XmlSecurityTest.kt`) was created to ensure external entities are not resolved or loaded.\\n- The vulnerability was assigned a critical severity rating with a CVSS score of 9.8.\\n- The vulnerability is classified under CWE-200, CWE-611, and CWE-918.\\n\\nIn summary, the content provides a comprehensive description of an XXE vulnerability in the `http4k` library, including the root cause, impact, attack vector, and how it was resolved.\", similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {},
