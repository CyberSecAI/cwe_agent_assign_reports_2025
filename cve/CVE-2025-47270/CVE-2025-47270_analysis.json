  "description": "nimiq/core-rs-albatross is a Rust implementation of the Nimiq Proof-of-Stake protocol based on the Albatross consensus algorithm. The `nimiq-network-libp2p` subcrate of nimiq/core-rs-albatross is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to **uncontrolled memory allocation**. Specifically, the implementation of the `Discovery` network message handling allocates a buffer based on a length value provided by the peer, without enforcing an upper bound. Since this length is a `u32`, a peer can trigger allocations of up to 4 GB, potentially leading to memory exhaustion and node crashes. As Discovery messages are regularly exchanged for peer discovery, this vulnerability can be exploited repeatedly. The patch for this vulnerability is formally released as part of v1.1.0. The patch implements a limit to the discovery message size of 1 MB and also resizes the message buffer size incrementally as the data is read. No known workarounds are available.",

It details a vulnerability in the `nimiq-network-libp2p` subcrate of the Nimiq PoS client implementation. Here's a breakdown of the information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\n*   Uncontrolled memory allocation when handling `Discovery` network messages. The implementation allocates a buffer based on a length value provided by the peer without an upper bound.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Denial of Service (DoS) due to excessive memory consumption.\n*   Specifically, a peer can trigger allocations of up to 4 GB, potentially leading to memory exhaustion and node crashes.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   Memory exhaustion leading to node crashes.\n*   Denial of Service.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   A malicious peer sending `Discovery` messages with a large length value.\n*   Exploitation is possible because Discovery messages are regularly exchanged.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   An attacker needs to be a peer in the Nimiq network.\n*   No specific privileges are required.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   The patch (pull request #3384) limits the discovery message size to 1 MB.\n*   The patch also resizes the message buffer incrementally as data is read.\n*   The fix is included in release v1.1.0.\n\n**Additional details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   CVSS score: 7.5 (High)\n*   CVSS vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H\n*   CWE ID: CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption)\n*   Credits to the vulnerability finders: @pl4smaN and @jsdanielh.\n*   Details of the pull request that fixed the issue (#3384) and the commit hash (566935f).\n*   Information about the affected package (cargo, nimiq-network-libp2p).\n*   Affected and patched versions are specified (<v1.1.0 and >=v1.1.0 respectively).",

CWE-770, in turn, is a more general case of resource exhaustion. The relationships show a hierarchy where CWE-789 is a specific type of CWE-770, and CWE-770 is a type of CWE-400 [CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption]. The chosen CWE, CWE-789, is at the Variant level, providing the most specific description of the **uncontrolled memory allocation** vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe789[\"CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    \n    cwe789 -->|CHILDOF| cwe770\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe789 primary\n    class cwe770,cwe400 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **uncontrolled memory allocation** due to a missing upper bound check on the size provided by the peer. This leads to excessive memory consumption and, ultimately, a Denial of Service (DoS).\n\nRoot Cause: **Uncontrolled Memory Allocation** (CWE-789) -> Excessive Memory Consumption (CWE-770) -> Denial of Service (CWE-400)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and supporting evidence from the CVE reference links content summary. The description clearly indicates that the root cause is **uncontrolled memory allocation** based on an untrusted size value from a peer, without an upper bound. This directly aligns with CWE-789 [CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value]. The retriever results also list CWE-789 as a potential match.\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"Specifically, the implementation of the `Discovery` network message handling allocates a buffer based on a length value provided by the peer, without enforcing an upper bound.
