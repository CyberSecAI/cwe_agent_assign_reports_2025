# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-1781

## Vulnerability Description
There is a **XXE** in W3CSS Validator versions before cssval-20250226 that allows an attacker to use specially-crafted XML objects to coerce server-side request forgery (SSRF). This could be exploited to read arbitrary local files if an attacker has access to exception messages.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **XXE**
- **impact:** server-side request forgery
- **vector:** specially-crafted XML objects
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** W3CSS Validator
- **version:** before cssval-20250226

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-1781 Content

This content **IS RELATED** to CVE-2025-1781. It provides significantly more detail than a standard CVE description.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

Unsafe parsing of XML data when untrusted XML data is passed to the `DocumentParser()` constructor and is not properly sanitized. Specifically, the vulnerability stems from allowing external entities and DTD validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **XXE (XML External Entity) Injection:** The core vulnerability.
*   **SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery):**  An attacker can coerce the server to make requests to arbitrary URLs.
*   **LFI (Local File Inclusion):**  Potentially exploitable if the attacker has access to error messages or stack traces.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Achievable through "Billion Laughs" XML payloads.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **SSRF:**  Allows an attacker to make requests on behalf of the server, potentially accessing internal resources.
*   **LFI:**  Allows an attacker to read arbitrary local files (under specific conditions).
*   **DoS:**  Can crash the service due to excessive resource consumption.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** SSRF combined with LFI could potentially lead to data exfiltration.

**Attack vectors:**

*   Providing malicious XML payloads to the CSS validator. This can be done through the `css-validator.jar` main method or when used as a library.
*   Specifically, the proof-of-concept shows using a crafted XML file with an XXE entity pointing to a local URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to supply XML data to the CSS validator.
*   For LFI exploitation, access to error messages or stack traces is required.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   Uncommenting the lines that disable external entities and DTD validation. This is the recommended mitigation.

**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**

*   **Affected Package:** W3C CSS Validator
*   **Affected Versions:**  All versions up to the patched commit (dfc4ca1a3b1147c60149da5df531c5a55333616f)
*   **Patched Versions:** The commit dfc4ca1a3b1147c60149da5df531c5a55333616f
*   **Proof of Concept Payloads:**  Detailed examples for SSRF, DoS ("Billion Laughs"), and LFI are provided.
*   **Timeline:** Dates of reporting, fixing, and disclosure are included.
*   **Credits:**  The researcher who found the vulnerability is credited.
*   **No CWEs** are listed.
