  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved virt tdx-guest Just leak decrypted memory on unrecoverable errors In CoCo VMs it is possible for the untrusted host to cause set_memory_decrypted() to fail such that an error is returned and the resulting memory is shared. Callers need to take care to handle these errors to avoid returning decrypted (shared) memory to the page allocator, which could lead to functional or security issues. Leak the decrypted memory when set_memory_decrypted() fails, and dont need to print an error since set_memory_decrypted() will call WARN_ONCE().",

The retriever results also suggested CWE-909, CWE-404, CWE-908, and CWE-824 which are related to resource management. CWE-401 is the most specific among them regarding memory management. CWE-316 is a Variant and captures the data exposure aspect, and could exist as a follow-up to the **missing release of memory**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe401[\"CWE-401: Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime\"]\n    cwe316[\"CWE-316: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in Memory\"]\n\n    cwe401 -->|CAN_LEAD_TO| cwe316\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe401 primary\n    class cwe316 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **failure to release decrypted memory** after `set_memory_decrypted()` fails (CWE-401). This leads to the **decrypted memory being leaked** and potentially accessed by unauthorized parties or reused in an insecure manner (CWE-316).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary assessment is based on the provided evidence which indicates a memory leak scenario. The vulnerability description explicitly states \"Leak the decrypted memory when set_memory_decrypted() fails\". This directly aligns with CWE-401 (Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime). The potential for this leaked memory to contain sensitive information further suggests CWE-316 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in Memory) as a secondary concern.\n\nThe graph relationship shows that CWE-401 can lead to CWE-316, which aligns with the vulnerability description where the **failure to release memory** can result in sensitive data being exposed.\n\nThe selection of CWE-401 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly addresses the **root cause** of the vulnerability: the **failure to properly release memory**. CWE-316 highlights the potential consequence of the leaked memory containing sensitive information.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-909: Missing Initialization of Resource\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not initialize a critical resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-908: Use of Uninitialized Resource\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses or accesses a resource that has not been initialized.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-665: Improper Initialization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not initialize or incorrectly initializes a resource, which might leave the resource in an unexpected state when it is accessed or used.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
