  "description": "Nextcloud Server is a self hosted personal cloud system. After a user received a share with some files inside being blocked by the files access control, the user would still be able to copy the intermediate folder inside Nextcloud allowing them to afterwards potentially access the blocked files depending on the user access control rules. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server is upgraded to 27.1.9, 28.0.5 or 29.0.0 and Nextcloud Enterprise Server is upgraded to 21.0.9.18, 22.2.10.23, 23.0.12.18, 24.0.12.14, 25.0.13.9, 26.0.13.3, 27.1.9, 28.0.5 or 29.0.0.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-52514:\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe vulnerability arises from insufficient access control enforcement during folder copying operations in Nextcloud. Specifically, when a user receives a share containing files that are blocked by the files access control mechanism, the user can still copy the intermediate folder containing those blocked files.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n- **Missing Access Control Checks:** The system fails to properly check access control rules when copying a folder containing blocked files.\n- **Bypass of File Access Control:**  By copying the intermediate folder, users can potentially gain access to files that they should not have access to based on the intended access control rules.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Confidentiality Breach:** A user who has received a share with some files blocked by access control can copy the folder containing those blocked files and potentially access those blocked files, leading to unauthorized data access.\n- **Scope Change:** The vulnerability allows a user to bypass access controls that are supposed to restrict file access, thus impacting security beyond the intended scope of file sharing.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Network:** The attack is performed over the network via the Nextcloud web interface or API.\n- **User Interaction:** The user needs to interact with the system to initiate the copy operation.\n- **Shared Files:** The attack requires a user to be a recipient of a share containing files that are blocked by the files access control.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Low Privileges:** The attacker needs to be a regular user who has received a share.\n- **User Interaction:** The attacker has to be able to use the file copy function within Nextcloud.\n\n**Additional details:**\n\n- **Affected Versions:** The vulnerability affects Nextcloud Server versions 27.0.0 and later, and Nextcloud Enterprise Server versions 21.0.0 and later.\n- **Patched Versions:** The vulnerability is fixed in Nextcloud Server versions 27.1.9, 28.0.5, and 29.0.0, and in Nextcloud Enterprise Server versions 21.0.9.18, 22.2.10.23, 23.0.12.18, 24.0.12.14, 25.0.13.9, 26.0.13.3, 27.1.9, 28.0.5, and 29.0.0.\n- **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 4.1, with a vector of AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N.\n\nThe provided information also includes the pull request that fixes the vulnerability which introduced an additional check to prevent cross-storage moves when access controls are in place.",

This is supported by the CVE Reference Links Content Summary which states \"**Missing Access Control Checks:** The system fails to properly check access control rules when copying a folder containing blocked files.\" The **impact** of the vulnerability is that it allows access to blocked files, which aligns with CWE-552 (Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties).\n\nThe decision to select CWE-862 is based on the provided evidence, the retriever results, and the mapping guidance. The mapping guidance specifically indicates that CWE-862 is appropriate when the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all. The level of specificity is appropriate as it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 1990.09\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 1988.33\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-285: Improper Authorization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 1927.61\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-285 is high-level and lower-level CWEs can frequently be used instead.
