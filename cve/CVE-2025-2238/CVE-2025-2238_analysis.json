CWE-863 is a Class level CWE and a parent of more specific CWEs. There isn't a clear parent-child relationship that would override the selection of CWE-266. The vulnerability description indicates an **incorrect assignment of privileges** due to **insufficient user_meta restrictions**. This aligns directly with CWE-266. CWE-863 could also apply as there is **incorrect authorization**, however, the evidence points more specifically to **incorrect privilege assignment**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe266[\"CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe266\n    cwe863\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe266 primary\n    class cwe863 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **insufficient user_meta restrictions** (CWE-266), which leads to the ability for authenticated attackers to escalate their privileges to Administrator-level.
