{
 "cve_id": "CVE-2025-4780",
 "extracted_content": "**Vulnerability Details (from the github.com content):**\n\n*   **Vulnerable Component:** `/foreigner-search.php` in \"Park Ticketing Management System\" V2.0.\n*   **Vulnerability Type:** SQL injection.\n*   **Root Cause:** The `searchdata` parameter in `/foreigner-search.php` is vulnerable to SQL injection. User input for this parameter is not properly validated or sanitized before being used in SQL queries. Attackers can inject malicious SQL code.\n*   **Impact:** Attackers can gain unauthorized database access, leading to data leakage, data tampering, system control, and service disruption.\n*   **Attack Vector:** Exploitation occurs through the `searchdata` parameter using POST requests.\n*   **Attack Payload Examples:** The provided content includes example payloads for time-based blind and UNION query SQL injection, which can be used to exploit this vulnerability.\n*   **Screenshots:** The content includes screenshots obtained using the sqlmap tool, demonstrating the successful detection of the vulnerability and the ability to interact with the database.\n*   **Suggested Repair:**\n    1.  Use prepared statements and parameter binding to separate SQL code from user input, treating user-entered values as data.\n    2.  Implement input validation and filtering to ensure user input conforms to expected formats.\n    3.  Minimize database user permissions, using accounts with minimal privileges for operations, and avoiding high-privilege accounts.\n",
