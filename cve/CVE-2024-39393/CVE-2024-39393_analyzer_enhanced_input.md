## Vulnerability Description
InDesign Desktop versions ID19.4, ID18.5.2 and earlier are affected by an **out-of-bounds read vulnerability** when parsing a crafted file, which could result in a read past the end of an allocated memory structure. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current user. Exploitation of this issue requires user interaction in that a victim must open a malicious file.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **out-of-bounds read vulnerability**
- **impact:** execute code and read past the end of an allocated memory structure
- **vector:** crafted file
- **product:** Adobe InDesign Desktop
- **version:** ['ID19.4' and 'ID18.5.2 and earlier']

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Out-of-bounds Read
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software reads data past the boundary of a buffer, leading to an out-of-bounds read.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local, requiring user interaction (opening a specially crafted file).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have the user open a crafted file using a vulnerable version of Adobe InDesign.
