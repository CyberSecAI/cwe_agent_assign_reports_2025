  "description": "A vulnerability in open-webui/open-webui v0.3.8 allows an unauthenticated attacker to sign up with excessively large text in the name field, causing the Admin panel to become unresponsive. This prevents administrators from performing essential user management actions such as deleting, editing, or adding users. The vulnerability can also be exploited by authenticated users with low privileges, leading to the same unresponsive state in the Admin panel.",

CWE-400 is a direct representation of this. CWE-863 is a possible contributing factor, as incorrect authorization could allow the excessive resource consumption, but the direct trigger is the large input. The abstraction levels influenced the choice to focus on the Base level CWE-400 for direct impact, while acknowledging CWE-863 as a broader Class-level concern related to authorization.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe400 -->|IMPACTED_BY| cwe863\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe400 primary\n    class cwe863 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events starts with an unauthenticated attacker providing excessively large text in the name field. This leads to uncontrolled resource consumption on the server, ultimately causing the Admin panel to become unresponsive.\n\n  - Root Cause: Large text input leading to excessive resource usage (**CWE-400**)\n  - Impact: Unresponsive Admin panel\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary assessment is based on the vulnerability description indicating that excessively large text in the name field causes the Admin panel to become unresponsive. This aligns well with **CWE-400** (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption).\n\nThe vulnerability description clearly states, \"A vulnerability in open-webui/open-webui v0.3.8 allows an unauthenticated attacker to sign up with **excessively large text in the name field**, causing the Admin panel to become **unresponsive**.\"\n\nThe graph relationships and retriever results were used to consider other potential CWEs, such as **CWE-863** (Incorrect Authorization). While authorization issues could contribute, the direct and immediate cause described in the vulnerability is the resource consumption due to the large input.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because **CWE-400** directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability (uncontrolled resource consumption), while **CWE-863** is a broader, more general issue that may contribute but is not the primary driver of the described vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
