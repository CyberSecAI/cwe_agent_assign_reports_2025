  "description": "A vulnerability was found in Nothings stb up to f056911. It has been rated as critical. Affected by this issue is the function stb_dupreplace. The manipulation leads to **integer overflow**. The attack may be launched remotely. Continious delivery with rolling releases is used by this product. Therefore, no version details of affected nor updated releases are available. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",

This is a base level CWE. There are parent and child relationships, but they do not provide any better specificity to the vulnerability. There are also chain relationships, but they are impacts of the integer overflow, not the cause.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe190[\"CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe190 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is:\n1.  **Integer Overflow (CWE-190)** in the stb_dupreplace function\n2.  The description does not specify the impact of the integer overflow.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that the vulnerability is an **integer overflow** in the stb_dupreplace function.
