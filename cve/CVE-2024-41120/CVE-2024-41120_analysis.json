  "description": "streamlit-geospatial is a streamlit multipage app for geospatial applications. Prior to commit c4f81d9616d40c60584e36abb15300853a66e489, the `url` variable on line 63 of `pages/9__Vector_Data_Visualization.py` takes user input, which is later passed to the `gpd.read_file` method. `gpd.read_file` method creates a request to arbitrary destinations, leading to blind **server-side request forgery**. Commit c4f81d9616d40c60584e36abb15300853a66e489 fixes this issue.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-41120:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\n*   The vulnerability lies in the `pages/9_\ud83d\udd32_Vector_Data_Visualization.py` file.\n*   The application takes a user-supplied URL as input.\n*   This URL is passed to the `gpd.read_file` method, which fetches and processes the data from the given URL without proper validation.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Blind Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The application makes requests to arbitrary URLs specified by the user. This is a blind SSRF because the application doesn't return the content of the response to the user but is still vulnerable to the issue.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   An attacker can make the server send requests to internal resources or external services by controlling the URL passed as input, which can lead to the following:\n    *   **Internal Port Scanning:** Attackers can probe internal services to find open ports and running services.\n    *   **Access to Internal Services:** They can attempt to access internal web pages or APIs, potentially gaining access to sensitive data.\n    *   **Denial of Service:** Making the server request large files from other servers could lead to server overload and denial of service.\n    *   **Data Exfiltration:** In some instances, an attacker might be able to exfiltrate data by sending requests to an external server they control with sensitive information encoded in the URL.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   The attack vector is through the user-controlled `url` variable within the `Vector Data Visualization` page of the application.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   The attacker only needs the ability to interact with the application through its web interface.\n*   No special privileges or internal network access is needed. The attacker can be anyone with access to the streamlit-geospatial application.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n*   The provided content includes a Proof of Concept (PoC) that demonstrates the SSRF by making the server fetch a local file from an attacker-controlled server.\n*   The fix implemented in commit `c4f81d9616d40c60584e36abb15300853a66e489` addresses the vulnerability by introducing a whitelist of trusted URLs, and only makes requests if the provided URL is on the whitelist, preventing the SSRF by limiting the scope of allowed requests.",

While no explicit parent-child relationship exists between **CWE-918** and any input validation CWE, the failure to validate input properly is a prerequisite for SSRF.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe918[\"CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)\"]\n    cwe1286[\"CWE-1286: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input\"]\n\n    cwe918 <--|RESULT_OF| cwe1286\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe918 primary\n    class cwe1286 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper input sanitization**, which leads to **CWE-918** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly indicates a **server-side request forgery** (**weakness**) due to **improper input sanitization** (**rootcause**) of the URL provided by the user. The `gpd.read_file` method uses the user-supplied URL without proper validation, allowing an attacker to make the server send requests to arbitrary destinations.\n\nThe selection of **CWE-918** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as the primary CWE is strongly supported by the vulnerability description and the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\". The description explicitly mentions \"leading to blind **server-side request forgery**\" and the summary confirms that the application makes requests to arbitrary URLs specified by the user. The retriever results also list **CWE-918** as the top candidate. The mapping guidance for **CWE-918** allows its usage and states that it is at the Base level of abstraction, which is preferred.\n\n**CWE-1286** Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input is considered as a secondary CWE because the root cause of the vulnerability is the **improper input sanitization** that is allowing the **server-side request forgery**.\nThe vulnerability description mentions \"**improper input sanitization**\" as the root cause.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web server receives a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1286: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input that is expected to be well-formed - i.e., to comply with a certain syntax - but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input complies with the syntax.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
