# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-36242

## Vulnerability Description
**Protection mechanism failure** in the SPP for some Intel(R) Processors may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable escalation of privilege via local access.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **Protection mechanism failure**
- **impact:** escalation of privilege
- **vector:** local access
- **attacker:** authenticated user
- **product:** SPP for some Intel(R) Processors

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of CVE-2024-36242:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a protection mechanism failure within the Sub-Page write Permissions (SPP) of certain Intel processors.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Failure in the SPP protection mechanism, which is designed to control write access to memory sub-pages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Escalation of Privilege:** An attacker can potentially elevate their privileges on the system.
- The CVSS v3.1 score is 8.8 (High) with the vector AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H
- The CVSS v4.0 score is 7.3 (High) with the vector CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:P/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker requires local access to the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the system.

**Affected Products:**
- The vulnerability affects multiple Intel processor families, including:
    - 3rd Gen Intel® Xeon® Scalable processor family
    - Intel® Xeon® D Processor
    - 4th Generation Intel® Xeon® Scalable processors (Platinum, Gold, Silver, Bronze)
    - Intel® Xeon® CPU Max Series processors (High Bandwidth Memory HBM)
    - 4th Generation Intel® Xeon® Edge Enhanced Processors
    - Intel® Xeon® W2400 and W3400 Processors
    - 5th Generation Intel® Xeon® Scalable processors

**Additional Information:**
- Intel has released guidance for Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM, hypervisor) software in virtualized environments. They state that they are not aware of any mainstream VMM software that enables SPP and no action is required in non-virtualized environments or where SPP is not used.
- Intel recommends checking with the system manufacturer or retailer for product updates or patches.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* 🔍 *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* 🔍 *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion – CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### 🔸 CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ✅ *“A user created with the ‘guest’ role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ✅ *“The backup service runs as root but only needs read access.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ⚠️ This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### 🔸 CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ✅ *“User can access another user’s invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.”*

## Mapping Examples – Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *“User can escalate privileges to admin.”*
> ❌ Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged – only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ✅ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**

| “Escalate to root/admin”                    | Privilege escalation impact           | Not CWE-269! Use root cause (e.g., 266, 250) |
| “Assigned wrong role/group”                 | Misassigned privilege                 | CWE-266                                      |

| “Unauthorized read/write to file”           | Permission control issue              | CWE-285                                      |
| “Can access resource without correct role”  | Incorrect or missing permission check | CWE-285, 862, 863                            |

## Good Mapping Examples – Privileges & Permissions

* ✅ **CWE-266**: *“When a new user registers, the system assigns them admin role due to a missing role validation.”*
* ✅ **CWE-250**: *“Installer runs with system-level privileges but doesn't require them to install files in the user directory.”*
* ✅ **CWE-284**: *“Inconsistent access rules between UI and backend for sensitive endpoints.”*
* ✅ **CWE-285**: *“Authorization logic fails to restrict access to finance reports based on department.”*
