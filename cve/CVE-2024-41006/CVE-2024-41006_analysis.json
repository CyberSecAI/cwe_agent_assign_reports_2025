  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved netrom Fix a **memory leak** in nr_heartbeat_expiry() syzbot reported a **memory leak** in nr_create() [0]. Commit 409db27e3a2e (netrom Fix **use-after-free of a listening socket**.) added sock_hold() to the nr_heartbeat_expiry() function, where a) a socket has a SOCK_DESTROY flag or b) a listening socket has a SOCK_DEAD flag. But in the case a, when the SOCK_DESTROY flag is set, the file descriptor has already been closed and the nr_release() function has been called. So it makes no sense to hold the reference count because no one will call another nr_destroy_socket() and put it as in the case b. nr_connect nr_establish_data_link nr_start_heartbeat nr_release switch (nr->state) case NR_STATE_3 nr->state = NR_STATE_2 sock_set_flag(sk, SOCK_DESTROY) nr_rx_frame nr_process_rx_frame switch (nr->state) case NR_STATE_2 nr_state2_machine() nr_disconnect() nr_sk(sk)->state = NR_STATE_0 sock_set_flag(sk, SOCK_DEAD) nr_heartbeat_expiry switch (nr->state) case NR_STATE_0 if (sock_flag(sk, SOCK_DESTROY) || (sk->sk_state == TCP_LISTEN",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n- A memory leak was identified in the `nr_heartbeat_expiry()` function within the netrom module of the Linux kernel. The function incorrectly called `sock_hold()` in scenarios where the socket was already marked for destruction (`SOCK_DESTROY`) and its resources were already released by `nr_release()`.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- **Memory Leak:** The unnecessary `sock_hold()` call in `nr_heartbeat_expiry()` when the socket has the `SOCK_DESTROY` flag set increments the socket's reference count without a corresponding decrement. This causes the socket object to be orphaned in memory, leading to a memory leak.\n- **Incorrect Reference Counting:** The vulnerability stems from an incorrect assumption about when to use `sock_hold()`, leading to an imbalance in reference counting.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- **Resource Exhaustion:** Repeatedly triggering the vulnerable code path can lead to gradual memory exhaustion, which could destabilize the system and potentially lead to denial of service.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- The vulnerability can be triggered by initiating and closing netrom sockets in a specific way. The specific trigger involves the socket entering `NR_STATE_3`, transitioning to `NR_STATE_2`, being marked with `SOCK_DESTROY`, and then eventually reaching `nr_heartbeat_expiry()`.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- An attacker needs to be able to create and close netrom sockets, either locally or remotely.\n- No specific position is needed other than having the capability to interact with the netrom interface.\n- The attacker doesn't need any specific privileges to trigger this vulnerability.\n\n**Additional Notes**\n- The provided patches fix the issue by only calling `sock_hold()` if the socket is in TCP\\_LISTEN state and has the `SOCK_DEAD` flag set, thus ensuring `sock_hold()` is used correctly.\n- The vulnerability was found by syzkaller, a fuzzer, indicating that the issue was found through automated testing.\n- The fix was introduced by commit `0b9130247f3b6a1122478471ff0e014ea96bb735` and backported to various stable branches as well.",

A socket is held using `sock_hold()` within `nr_heartbeat_expiry()`.\n2.  Under certain conditions (e.g., `SOCK_DESTROY` flag set), the socket's file descriptor is closed, and `nr_release()` is called.\n3.  The reference count held by `sock_hold()` is not properly released, resulting in a **memory leak** **(CWE-401)**.\n4.  The **use-after-free** **(CWE-416)** occurs because the socket may be accessed after it has been freed.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is **CWE-416 (Use After Free)**, stemming from the incorrect handling of socket references in the `nr_heartbeat_expiry()` function within the Linux kernel's netrom module. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"netrom Fix **use-after-free of a listening socket**.\" leading directly to the root cause. The secondary weakness is **CWE-401 (Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime)**, since the failure to properly release the socket reference leads to the **memory leak**, as \"syzbot reported a **memory leak** in nr_create()\" and \"netrom Fix a **memory leak** in nr_heartbeat_expiry()\".\n\nThe relationship analysis shows that **CWE-416** can lead to **CWE-401**, establishing a clear chain. The retriever results also highlighted relevant CWEs such as **CWE-911 (Improper Update of Reference Count)**, which is related to the root cause of the vulnerability but is not as precise as **CWE-416**. **CWE-415 (Double Free)** was also considered, but the description does not explicitly indicate a double free condition.\n\nThe selection of **CWE-416** and **CWE-401** offers a balanced view of the root cause and its direct impact, providing a comprehensive understanding of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-911: Improper Update of Reference Count\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a reference count to manage a resource, but it does not update or incorrectly updates the reference count.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-909: Missing Initialization of Resource\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not initialize a critical resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-665: Improper Initialization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not initialize or incorrectly initializes a resource, which might leave the resource in an unexpected state when it is accessed or used.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
