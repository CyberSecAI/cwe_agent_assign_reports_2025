# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-41006

# Vulnerability Description

    In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved netrom Fix a **memory leak** in nr_heartbeat_expiry() syzbot reported a **memory leak** in nr_create() [0]. Commit 409db27e3a2e (netrom Fix **use-after-free of a listening socket**.) added sock_hold() to the nr_heartbeat_expiry() function, where a) a socket has a SOCK_DESTROY flag or b) a listening socket has a SOCK_DEAD flag. But in the case a, when the SOCK_DESTROY flag is set, the file descriptor has already been closed and the nr_release() function has been called. So it makes no sense to hold the reference count because no one will call another nr_destroy_socket() and put it as in the case b. nr_connect nr_establish_data_link nr_start_heartbeat nr_release switch (nr->state) case NR_STATE_3 nr->state = NR_STATE_2 sock_set_flag(sk, SOCK_DESTROY) nr_rx_frame nr_process_rx_frame switch (nr->state) case NR_STATE_2 nr_state2_machine() nr_disconnect() nr_sk(sk)->state = NR_STATE_0 sock_set_flag(sk, SOCK_DEAD) nr_heartbeat_expiry switch (nr->state) case NR_STATE_0 if (sock_flag(sk, SOCK_DESTROY) || (sk->sk_state == TCP_LISTEN
