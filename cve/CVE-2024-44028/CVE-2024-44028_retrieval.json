  "vulnerability_info": "VulnerabilityInfo(cve_id='CVE-2024-44028', description='Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in Nicejob NiceJob allows Stored **XSS**.This issue affects NiceJob from n/a before 3.6.5.', key_phrases={'rootcause': 'improper input sanitization', 'weakness': ['XSS', 'cross-site request forgery'], 'impact': 'execute stored JavaScript code', 'vector': '', 'attacker': '', 'product': 'Nicejob NiceJob', 'version': 'before 3.6.5', 'component': ''}, reference_content=\"Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:\\n\\n*   **Root Cause:** The WordPress NiceJob plugin versions prior to 3.6.5 are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).\\n*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of CSRF protection. This means that the plugin doesn't properly verify that requests are coming from legitimate users.\\n*  **Impact of Exploitation:** A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force higher-privileged users (e.g., administrators) to perform unwanted actions on the WordPress site, under their current authentication. The specific impact of this varies depending on the actions the plugin allows, but it could lead to unauthorized modification of the website, data breaches, or other harmful outcomes.\\n*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through a malicious web page or link, where a crafted request is sent to the vulnerable website when a logged-in user is tricked into visiting the malicious site or clicking the link.\\n*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious webpage or link. The attacker does not need to be authenticated on the vulnerable WordPress instance, but the targeted user does.\\n\\n**Additional Details:**\\n\\n*   The vulnerability is rated as a medium priority with a CVSS score of 7.1.\\n*   The vulnerability was reported by SOPROBRO.\\n*   A virtual patch is available from Patchstack to mitigate the issue.\\n*   The fixed version is 3.6.5.\\n*   This vulnerability is related to the OWASP Top 10 category A1: Broken Access Control.\", similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {}, 'top_cwes_by_threshold': {}}}, similarity_summary=SimilarityInsight(consensus_cwe='', top_cwes=[], confidence_levels={}, total_samples=0), analysis='', analysis_with_relationships='', criticism='', resolution='', relevant_cwes=[{'metadata': {'doc_id': '601', 'name': \"URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')\", 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The web application accepts a user-controlled input that specifies a link to an external site, and uses that link in a redirect.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'weakness:cross-site request forgery', 'keyphrase': 'cross-site request forgery', 'type': 'weakness'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(208.10542300563978)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '352', 'name': 'Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'rootcause:improper input sanitization', 'keyphrase': 'improper input sanitization', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'weakness:XSS', 'keyphrase': 'XSS', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'weakness:cross-site request forgery', 'keyphrase': 'cross-site request forgery', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'impact:execute stored JavaScript code', 'keyphrase': 'execute stored JavaScript code', 'type': 'impact'}, {'id': 'product:Nicejob NiceJob', 'keyphrase': 'Nicejob NiceJob', 'type': 'product'}, {'id': 'version:before 3.6.5', 'keyphrase': 'before 3.6.5', 'type': 'version'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(184.91689206331438)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '116', 'name': 'Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
