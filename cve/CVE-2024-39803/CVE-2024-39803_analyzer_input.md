# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-39803

## Vulnerability Description
Multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities exist in the qos.cgi qos_settings() functionality of Wavlink AC3000 M33A8.V5030.210505. A specially crafted HTTP request can lead to stack-based buffer overflow. An attacker can make an authenticated HTTP request to trigger these vulnerabilities.A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `sel_mode` POST parameter.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2024-39803 Content

This content is **RELEVANT** to CVE-2024-39803 and provides significantly more detail than the placeholder CVE description.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerabilities stem from insufficient input validation when handling HTTP POST requests to the `qos.cgi` script, specifically within the `qos_settings()` function. The script uses `strdup` and `sprintf` to process data from the `qos_bandwidth`, `qos_dat`, and `sel_mode` POST parameters without checking the length of the input, leading to buffer overflows.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **CWE-120 - Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input (‘Classic Buffer Overflow’):**  The core vulnerability is a classic buffer overflow.
*   Multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities exist in the `qos.cgi` script. Specifically in the `qos_settings()` function.
*   Vulnerable parameters: `qos_bandwidth`, `qos_dat`, and `sel_mode`.

**Impact of exploitation:**

Successful exploitation allows an attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution. The attacker can overwrite the return address on the stack, redirecting control flow to malicious code.

**Attack vectors:**

*   An attacker can send a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `qos.cgi` script.
*   The attacker needs to be authenticated (have a valid session cookie) to access the `qos.cgi` script.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker must have network access to the Wavlink AC3000 router and a valid session cookie (i.e., be logged in as a user with sufficient privileges).
*   **HTTP Request Crafting:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious HTTP POST request with carefully designed payloads for the vulnerable parameters.

**Mitigation or fix:**

The report does not explicitly state a fix, but implies that proper input validation and bounds checking on the `qos_bandwidth`, `qos_dat`, and `sel_mode` parameters within the `qos.cgi` script are necessary to mitigate the vulnerabilities.  The vendor was working on patches at the time of the report.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Product:** Wavlink AC3000 M33A8.V5030.210505
*   **CVSSv3 Score:** 9.1 (Critical)
*   **CVEs:** CVE-2024-39803, CVE-2024-39801, CVE-2024-39802 (The report details all three CVEs, which are all related to the same root cause in the `qos.cgi` script).
*   **Timeline:** The report includes a timeline of vendor communication and disclosure.
*   **Discovered by:** Lilith of Cisco Talos.
