## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2024-39817:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the handling of browsing restrictions within the Custom App feature of Cybozu Office.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Access Control (CWE-201):** The core issue is that the software fails to properly enforce access controls when performing searches within Custom Apps. This allows users to potentially view data they are not authorized to see.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** A user with login access can potentially bypass the intended viewing restrictions on Custom App data. By conducting a "search" under certain conditions, they can gain unauthorized access to data they should not be able to view.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network (AV:N):** The vulnerability is exploitable over a network.
*   **Low Attack Complexity (AC:L):** The attack is relatively easy to execute.
*  **Low Privileges Required (PR:L):** Only a standard user login is required.
*   **No User Interaction (UI:N):**  No specific action from another user is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be a user with a valid login to Cybozu Office. They do not need any elevated privileges.
*   The attacker needs to be able to perform a search within Custom Apps.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability affects Cybozu Office versions 10.0.0 to 10.8.6.
*   The issue was addressed in Cybozu Office version 10.8.7 (and likely later versions).
* The CVSS v3 score is 4.3, with a vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N, indicating a network-based attack with low complexity, requiring low privileges, no user interaction and a low impact on confidentiality.
