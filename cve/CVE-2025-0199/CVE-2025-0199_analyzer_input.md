### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **sql injection**
- **product:** code-projects Point of Sales and Inventory Management System
- **version:** 1
- **component:** /user/minus_cart.php

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is caused by the lack of sanitization or validation of user-supplied input in the `id` parameter within the `minus_cart.php` file of a "pos-inventory-system-in-php" application. This allows for direct injection of SQL code into the database query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the presence of SQL injection in the `minus_cart.php` file through the `id` parameter. The application directly incorporates this parameter into the SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** A malicious attacker could exploit this vulnerability to obtain sensitive information from the server database.
- **Data Manipulation:** It is also possible to modify or delete data from the database.
- **Potential Complete System Takeover:** In some cases, SQL Injection can lead to remote command execution and complete system takeover.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP POST request to the `/POS_inventory/user/minus_cart.php` endpoint.
- **`id` Parameter:** The malicious SQL code is injected through the `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
- **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to craft and send HTTP POST requests.
- **Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs to have a basic understanding of SQL syntax to craft malicious SQL payloads.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided PoC demonstrates a simple SQL injection attempt using `id=1&min=1`, this can be modified to perform more sophisticated attacks.
- The application source is available at `<https://code-projects.org/pos-inventory-system-using-php-source-code/>`, this was identified as the source of the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability exists in the `minus_cart.php` file.
