# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-10964

## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability classified as critical has been found in emqx neuron up to 2.10.0. Affected is the function handle_add_plugin in the library cmd.library of the file plugins/restful/plugin_handle.c. The manipulation leads to **buffer overflow**. It is possible to launch the attack remotely. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **buffer overflow**
- **product:** emqx neuron
- **version:** up to 2.10.0
- **component:** handle_add_plugin function in plugins/restful/plugin_handle.c

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the `handle_add_plugin` and `handle_update_plugin` functions within the `plugins/restful/plugin_handle.c` file. Specifically, the `strcpy` function is used to copy the `req->library` string to `cmd.library` without checking the size of the destination buffer `cmd.library`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** The primary weakness is the use of `strcpy`, which is known to be unsafe because it does not perform bounds checking. If the length of the source string (`req->library`) exceeds the size of the destination buffer (`cmd.library`), a buffer overflow will occur.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The code lacks proper input validation to ensure the size of the `req->library` string does not exceed the allocated buffer `cmd.library`, which is defined by `NEU_PLUGIN_LIBRARY_LEN`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Memory Corruption:** A buffer overflow can overwrite adjacent memory locations, potentially leading to unpredictable behavior, crashes, or even arbitrary code execution.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By providing an overly long library name, an attacker could cause the application to crash, leading to a denial of service.
- **Potential for Code Execution:** In more severe cases, an attacker might be able to overwrite critical parts of memory to gain control of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **API Endpoint:** The vulnerability is triggered through the `/api/v2/plugin` interface, which is likely an HTTP API endpoint.
- **Malicious Input:** An attacker would exploit this by sending a specially crafted request to the API with an overly long `library` parameter value in the request payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have the ability to send requests to the vulnerable API endpoint.
- **Knowledge of API:** The attacker needs to know the structure of the API requests, specifically the `library` parameter.
- **Ability to send crafted requests:**  The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests containing the overly long library string.

**Additional Details:**
- The code fix replaces `strcpy` with `strncpy` which allows specifying a maximum length to copy, preventing the overflow: `strncpy(cmd.library, req->library, NEU_PLUGIN_LIBRARY_LEN);`
- The constant `NEU_PLUGIN_LIBRARY_LEN` likely defines the size of `cmd.library`.

This information indicates a clear buffer overflow vulnerability that was fixed by replacing the `strcpy` function with a safer `strncpy` function.
