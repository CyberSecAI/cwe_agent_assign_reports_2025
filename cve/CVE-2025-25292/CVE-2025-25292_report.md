# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2025-25292

## Description

ruby-saml provides security assertion markup language (SAML) single sign-on (SSO) for Ruby. An authentication bypass vulnerability was found in ruby-saml prior to versions 1.12.4 and 1.18.0 due to a parser differential. ReXML and Nokogiri parse XML differently, the parsers can generate entirely different document structures from the same XML input. That allows an attacker to be able to execute a Signature Wrapping attack. This issue may lead to authentication bypass. Versions 1.12.4 and 1.18.0 contain a patch for the issue.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Rootcause:** parser differential between ReXML and Nokogiri
- **Product:** ruby-saml
- **Impact:** authentication bypass, Signature Wrapping attack
- **Attacker:** attacker
- **Version:** prior to 1.12.4 and 1.18.0

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-347 | Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE. The vulnerability stems from the **improper verification of cryptographic signatures** due to parser differences. |
| CWE-287 | Improper Authentication | 0.7 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary Candidate. Authentication is bypassed as a result of the signature wrapping. |
| CWE-611 | Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference | 0.5 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate. Parser differences may cause external entity references, but there is not sufficient evidence. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is **improper verification of cryptographic signatures** (CWE-347), which can lead to **improper authentication** (CWE-287). CWE-347 is a base-level CWE, providing a specific description of the root cause. CWE-287 is a class-level CWE, representing a broader category of authentication failures. CWE-611 is a base level that may be present due to XML processing, but is not evident.

## Vulnerability Chain
1.  **Root Cause:** **Parser differential** between ReXML and Nokogiri leading to different document structures (Implicit).
2.  **Weakness:** **Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature** (CWE-347).
3.  **Impact:** Authentication Bypass, Signature Wrapping attack.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis concludes that the primary CWE is CWE-347 (**Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature**), with a high confidence score of 0.9. This assessment is strongly based on the provided evidence, particularly the CVE Reference Links Content Summary which states, "The vulnerability is due to a 'parser differential' in the `ruby-saml` library... This discrepancy allows for the construction of a 'Signature Wrapping' attack." This leads to the **improper verification of the cryptographic signature**, which is the root cause of the authentication bypass.

CWE-287 (**Improper Authentication**) is considered a secondary candidate, with a confidence score of 0.7, because it represents the impact of the **improper signature verification**. While the ultimate result is an authentication bypass, the root cause lies in the signature verification process.

CWE-611 (**Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference**) was also considered since parser differences may allow external entity references, however, there is insufficient evidence to support the presence of this vulnerability.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-347 being a base-level CWE that accurately represents the root cause of the vulnerability.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-204: Observable Response Discrepancy
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product provides different responses to incoming requests in a way that reveals internal state information to an unauthorized actor outside of the intended control sphere.
