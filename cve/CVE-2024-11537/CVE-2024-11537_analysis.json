  "description": "IrfanView DXF File Parsing **Out-Of-Bounds Read** Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of IrfanView. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of DXF files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-24620.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the insufficient validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of DXF files within IrfanView. This lack of validation allows for a read operation past the end of an allocated buffer.\n*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The core weakness is an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. This occurs because the software does not properly check the size or validity of data being read from the DXF file, potentially accessing memory outside the intended buffer.\n*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current IrfanView process. This means the attacker could gain control over the user's system, install malware, or steal sensitive information.\n*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector involves a malicious DXF file. The user must either open this file directly or visit a malicious web page that triggers the vulnerability by loading the file.\n*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious DXF file to exploit this vulnerability. They also need to convince a user to open this file or visit a site hosting it. Since the CVSS score includes \"User Interaction\" (UI:R), the attacker cannot exploit the vulnerability without the user taking some action.\n\nThe information provided here is more detailed than the basic description in the CVE placeholder, providing specifics on the vulnerable file type (DXF), the type of memory corruption (out-of-bounds read), and the impact (remote code execution).",

CWE-20, Improper Input Validation, is a class-level CWE that can be a contributing factor. CWE-125 is a more specific (Base) level weakness and directly reflects the **out-of-bounds read** condition described in the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n\n    cwe125 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe125 primary\n    class cwe20 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data** (Improper Input Validation), which leads to an **Out-Of-Bounds Read**, and culminates in Remote Code Execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on identifying the root cause and the specific weakness exploited. The evidence clearly points to CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) as the primary vulnerability, supported by the vulnerability description explicitly stating \"the issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer\" and \"**weakness:** **Out-Of-Bounds Read**\".\n\nThe retriever results also list CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write), CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read), and CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) as potential candidates. However, the description focuses on a read operation, making CWE-125 the most accurate choice. While CWE-787 was selected by \"CWE for similar CVE Descriptions\" the description explicitly states that the vulnerability is an \"Out-Of-Bounds Read\"\n\nCWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) is considered a secondary factor, as the **lack of proper validation** is the root cause enabling the out-of-bounds read. However, it's a class-level CWE and less specific than CWE-125.\n\nThe final decision prioritizes the explicit mention of \"Out-Of-Bounds Read\" in the vulnerability description and the supporting evidence from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary. This makes CWE-125 the most appropriate and specific classification.\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-125:

array.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value

that resolve to documents outside of the intended sphere of control, causing the product to embed incorrect documents into its output.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous

within its environment.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-782: Exposed IOCTL with Insufficient Access Control\n**Abstraction Level**:

causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-119 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available.\n\n## CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 1163.03\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 1158.16\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs a calculation that can\n         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic\n         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than\n         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is\n         incremented to a value that is too large to store in the\n         associated representation. When this occurs, the value may\n         become a",
