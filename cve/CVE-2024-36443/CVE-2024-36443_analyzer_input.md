- **vector:** anonymous FTP
- **attacker:** remote attacker
- **product:** Swissphone DiCal-RED 4009

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The DiCal-RED radio module provides an FTP service on TCP port 21 that allows anonymous login, without any authentication.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Missing Authentication for Critical Function (CWE-306):** The FTP service allows unauthenticated access, which grants read access to the entire file system.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive information, such as device configuration files (e.g., `/etc/deviceconfig`) which contains the device password's hash, can be accessed by anonymous users.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Attackers can gain access to configuration files containing sensitive data like password hashes.
*   **Potential for Further Exploitation:**  With access to device configuration and potentially password hashes, attackers might be able to escalate their access to the system.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs network connectivity to the device to access the FTP service (TCP port 21). This could be via Ethernet, Wi-Fi, or cellular network, depending on the device's configuration.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network access:** The attacker needs to be on the same network or have network access to the DiCal-RED device to connect to the FTP service.
*   **Basic FTP Knowledge:**  The attacker needs to be able to use an FTP client to connect to the device and retrieve files.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vendor has stated that the product is End-of-Life (EOL) and will not be fixing this vulnerability.
*   The advisory recommends not running the device in an untrusted network.
