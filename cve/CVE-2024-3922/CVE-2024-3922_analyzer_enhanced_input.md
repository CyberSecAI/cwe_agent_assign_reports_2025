## Vulnerability Description
The Dokan Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the code parameter in all versions up to, and including, 3.10.3 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.
