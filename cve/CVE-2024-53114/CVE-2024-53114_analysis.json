  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved x86/CPU/AMD Clear **virtualized VMLOAD/VMSAVE** on Zen4 client A number of Zen4 client SoCs advertise the ability to use **virtualized VMLOAD/VMSAVE**, but using these instructions is reported to be a cause of a random host reboot. These instructions arent intended to be advertised on Zen4 client so clear the capability.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n- Some AMD Zen4 client SoCs incorrectly advertise support for virtualized VMLOAD/VMSAVE instructions. Using these instructions can lead to random host reboots.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- The primary weakness is the incorrect advertisement of the virtualized VMLOAD/VMSAVE feature in certain Zen4 client SoCs.\n- This discrepancy between advertised capabilities and actual stability leads to an unstable system if the feature is used.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- The primary impact of exploiting this vulnerability is system instability, specifically random host reboots. This could lead to data loss or denial of service.\n- The \"exploitation\" in this case is using the advertised virtualized VMLOAD/VMSAVE instructions.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- There is no specific attack vector in the traditional sense. The vulnerability arises from the system using the faulty advertised feature.\n- A malicious actor or even a standard process that utilized the problematic VMLOAD/VMSAVE instructions could trigger the reboot.\n- This isn't a remotely exploitable issue; it's a fault in the hardware and how the operating system interacts with the advertised feature.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- No specific attacker capabilities are needed. Any process that triggers virtualized VMLOAD/VMSAVE instructions on affected Zen4 client SoCs can cause the instability. This includes both userland and kernel code.\n- The attacker would need to have code execution on the affected machine.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The fix involves clearing the `X86_FEATURE_V_VMSAVE_VMLOAD` capability flag for the affected AMD Zen4 client SoCs. This prevents the system from attempting to use the unstable feature.\n- The vulnerability is not due to a software bug, but rather a misadvertisement of hardware capabilities by the BIOS.\n- The commit messages explicitly mentions this is a hardware issue with the CPU and the goal of this change is to disable the faulty functionality in the kernel.",

CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions) is a secondary consideration because the system does not handle the exceptional condition where the advertised feature is unstable.
