# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-53114
## Query
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved x86/CPU/AMD Clear virtualized VMLOAD/VMSAVE on Zen4 client A number of Zen4 client SoCs advertise the ability to use virtualized VMLOAD/VMSAVE, but using these instructions is reported to be a cause of a random host reboot. These instructions arent intended to be advertised on Zen4 client so clear the capability.

## Keyphrases
- **weakness**: 'virtualized VMLOAD', 'VMSAVE'
