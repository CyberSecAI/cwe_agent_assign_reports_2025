  "description": "Smartwares cameras CIP-37210AT and C724IP, as well as others which share the same firmware in versions up to 3.3.0, are vulnerable to **command injection**. During the initialization process, a user has to use a mobile app to provide devices with Access Point credentials. This input is not properly sanitized, what allows for **command injection**. The vendor has not replied to reports, so the patching status remains unknown. Newer firmware versions might be vulnerable as well.",

It details vulnerabilities found in Smartwares CIP-37210AT and C724IP cameras, including the vulnerability identified by this CVE. Here's an extraction of the relevant information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nDuring the initialization process, a user provides Access Point credentials via a mobile app. This input is not properly sanitized.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection') - CWE-77\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nThe lack of input sanitization allows for command injection. (The specific impact of the command injection is not detailed further in this content.)\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\nProviding malicious input during the Access Point credential setup via the mobile app.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\nAn attacker needs to be able to provide input to the mobile app during the camera initialization process.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\nThe content does not provide information about a fix or mitigation. It states that the vendor has not replied to reports, so the patching status is unknown.\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   Affected products: Smartwares CIP-37210AT and C724IP\n*   Vulnerable versions: All through 3.3.0\n*   The vulnerability was reported to CERT Polska.\n*   Other CVEs related to these cameras were also discovered: CVE-2024-13893 (Default Credentials) and CVE-2024-13894 (Path Traversal).",

Since the vulnerability specifically involves OS commands, CWE-78 is a more precise classification than the more general CWE-77.
