CWE-78 is a specific type of injection related to OS commands, making it a better fit than its parent class CWE-74. The Retriever Results also support this selection.

The description clearly states that attackers can \"inject malicious commands into mainfunction.cgi and execute arbitrary commands.\" The key phrase is \"inject malicious commands,\" which strongly suggests an injection vulnerability.\n\nThe Retriever Results highlighted CWE-78 as the top candidate, with a description that aligns well with the vulnerability: \"The product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command.\" This is a direct match to the vulnerability description, where attackers inject commands.\n\nThe relationship graph further solidified the choice of CWE-78 due to its specificity as a Base level CWE and its direct relevance to OS commands.\n\nThe decision is based on the evidence provided in the vulnerability description and supported by the Retriever Results and relationship analysis.
