  "query": "The FileOrganizer Manage WordPress and Website Files plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local JavaScript File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.4 via the default_lang parameter. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to include and execute arbitrary JavaScript files on the server, allowing the execution of any JavaScript code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where images and other safe file types can be uploaded and included.",
