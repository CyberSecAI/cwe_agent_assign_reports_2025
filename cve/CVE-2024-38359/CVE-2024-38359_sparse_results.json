A parsing vulnerability in lnds onion processing logic and lead to a DoS vector due to excessive memory allocation. The issue was patched in lnd v0.17.0. Users should update to a version > v0.17.0 to be protected. Users unable to upgrade may set the `--rejecthtlc` CLI flag and also disable forwarding on channels via the `UpdateChanPolicyCommand`, or disable listening on a public network interface via the `--nolisten` flag as a mitigation.",
