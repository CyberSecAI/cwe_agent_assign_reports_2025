  "description": "A **Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime** vulnerability in the Periodic Packet Management Daemon (ppmd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated adjacent attacker to cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS). When a BFD session configured with authentication flaps, ppmd memory can leak. Whether the leak happens depends on a **race condition** which is outside the attackers control. This issue only affects BFD operating in distributed aka delegated (which is the default behavior) or inline mode. Whether the leak occurs can be monitored with the following CLI command > show ppm request-queue FPC Pending-request fpc0 2 request-total-pending 2 where a continuously increasing number of pending requests is indicative of the leak. This issue affects Junos OS * All versions before 21.2R3-S8, * 21.4 versions before 21.4R3-S7, * 22.1 versions before 22.1R3-S4, * 22.2 versions before 22.2R3-S4, * 22.3 versions before 22.3R3, * 22.4 versions before 22.4R2-S2, 22.4R3. Junos OS Evolved * All versions before 21.2R3-S8-EVO, * 21.4-EVO versions before 21.4R3-S7-EVO, * 22.2-EVO versions before 22.2R3-S4-EVO, * 22.3-EVO versions before 22.3R3-EVO, * 22.4-EVO versions before 22.4R3-EVO.",

The vulnerability description explicitly states \"A **Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime** vulnerability\". This aligns perfectly with CWE-401. While other CWEs like CWE-664 and CWE-775 were considered, CWE-401 is the most specific and accurately describes the root cause. The retriever results also show high scores for CWE-401. Therefore, CWE-401 is the primary CWE. CWE-772 and CWE-664 are secondary considerations due to their broader scope, but they are less precise than CWE-401.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-696: Incorrect Behavior Order\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs multiple related behaviors, but the behaviors are performed in the wrong order in ways which may produce resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not maintain or incorrectly maintains control over a resource throughout its lifetime of creation, use, and release.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is high-level when lower-level children are available.\n\n## CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly anticipate or handle exceptional conditions that rarely occur during normal operation of the product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
