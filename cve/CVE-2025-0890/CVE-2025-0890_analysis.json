  "reference_content": "Here's an analysis of the provided content, focusing on CVE-2025-0890, following the given guidelines:\n\n**CVE ID:** CVE-2025-0890\n\n**Relates to CVE:** YES\n\n**Extracted Information:**\n\n*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insecure default credentials for the Telnet function.\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use of default credentials, enabled Telnet function.\n*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could log in to the management interface.\n*   **Attack vectors:** Exploitation occurs if administrators fail to change default credentials.\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No specific position is required, but the attacker needs to know the default credentials. WAN access and the Telnet function are disabled by default, so the attacker needs to have some level of access.\n*   **Mitigation or fix:** Replace affected legacy products with newer-generation equipment. Disable remote access and periodically change passwords.\n\n**Affected Products:**\n\n*   VMG1312-B10A\n*   VMG1312-B10B\n*   VMG1312-B10E\n*   VMG3312-B10A\n*   VMG3313-B10A\n*   VMG3926-B10B\n*   VMG4325-B10A\n*   VMG4380-B10A\n*   VMG8324-B10A\n*   VMG8924-B10A\n*   SBG3300\n*   SBG3500\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n*   The advisory states these are legacy products that have reached End-of-Life (EOL).\n*   WAN access and the Telnet function are disabled by default.\n*   The content provides more detail than the basic CVE description would likely contain, specifically listing affected models and providing context around the EOL status.\n*   The advisory also mentions CVE-2024-40890 and CVE-2024-40891, but the analysis focuses on CVE-2025-0890 as requested.",
