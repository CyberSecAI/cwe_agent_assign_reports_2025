  "description": "The Media.net Ads Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to **missing file type validation** and **missing capability check** in the sendMail function in all versions up to, and including, 2.10.13. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level and above permissions, to upload arbitrary files on the affected sites server which may make remote code execution possible. The vulnerability is only exploitable if anyone has ever logged in through the API.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-6431\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n- The `sendMail` function in the `MnetAdHandleAjaxCalls.php` file lacks proper file type validation and a capability check. This allows arbitrary file uploads.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Missing Authorization:** The `sendMail` function does not check for proper user capabilities, allowing users with subscriber-level or higher permissions to trigger the file upload.\n- **Unrestricted File Upload:** There is no validation of the file type being uploaded.\n- **Missing File Type Validation:** The plugin does not validate the type of file being uploaded which allows for arbitrary file uploads.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Arbitrary File Upload:** An attacker can upload any file to the server.\n- **Remote Code Execution (Possible):** By uploading a malicious file (e.g., a PHP file), an attacker could potentially achieve remote code execution on the server, leading to complete compromise.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.\n- **Authentication:** The attacker must have an account on the WordPress site with subscriber-level or higher permissions and also have logged in to the API at least once.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **WordPress Account:** The attacker needs a valid account on the WordPress site with at least subscriber-level privileges.\n- **API Interaction:** The vulnerability can only be exploited if someone has logged in through the API before.",
