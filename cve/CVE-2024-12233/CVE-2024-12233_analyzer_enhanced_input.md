## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability was found in code-projects Online Notice Board up to 1.0 and classified as critical. This issue affects some unknown processing of the file /registration.php of the component Profile Picture Handler. The manipulation of the argument img leads to **unrestricted upload**. The attack may be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **unrestricted upload**
- **product:** code-projects Online Notice Board
- **version:** up to 1.0
- **component:** /registration.php

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause:**
- The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the lack of file type validation and sanitization during the profile picture upload process in the `registration.php` file of the "online-notice-board-using-php" project.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Unrestricted File Upload:** The application allows users to upload any file type as a profile picture, without proper validation.
- **Lack of Sanitization:** The uploaded filename is not sanitized, allowing attackers to upload files with malicious extensions like `.php`.
- **Directory Traversal (Implicit):** Although not explicitly directory traversal, the vulnerability allows the attacker to upload a file to a user-controlled directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading a PHP file containing malicious code, attackers can execute arbitrary code on the server.
- **Full Server Compromise:** Successful exploitation could lead to a full server compromise, data breaches, malware installation, and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP POST request to the `registration.php` page, including the malicious PHP file as the profile picture upload.
- **Direct File Access:** After successful upload, the attacker directly accesses the uploaded PHP file via a web browser using a constructed URL.
- **Query Parameter for Command Execution:** The PHP file is designed to execute commands provided through a URL query parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Knowledge of vulnerable endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the `registration.php` endpoint and the upload mechanism used for the profile picture.
- **Ability to craft HTTP requests:** The attacker must be able to craft and send HTTP POST requests, including file uploads.
- **Access to the web application:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the application.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code snippet in `edit.php` (lines 36-37) is:
```php
mkdir("images/$e");
move_uploaded_file($_FILES['img']['tmp_name'],"images/$e/".$_FILES['img']['name']);
```
- `$e` is the user's email address used to create the directory.
- `$_FILES['img']['name']` is the original filename of the uploaded file, which is used as the filename on the server, without any validation or sanitization.
- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) includes the HTTP POST request to upload a PHP file named `basic_webshell.php` containing the code `<?php @eval($_GET['attack']);?>`, and the method for accessing this file to achieve remote command execution.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is in the `online-notice-board-using-php` project, obtained from `code-projects.org`.
- The described attack is a classic example of unrestricted file upload leading to Remote Code Execution.
