  "description": "A vulnerability was found in code-projects Online Notice Board up to 1.0 and classified as critical. This issue affects some unknown processing of the file /registration.php of the component Profile Picture Handler. The manipulation of the argument img leads to **unrestricted upload**. The attack may be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n- The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the lack of file type validation and sanitization during the profile picture upload process in the `registration.php` file of the \"online-notice-board-using-php\" project.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n- **Unrestricted File Upload:** The application allows users to upload any file type as a profile picture, without proper validation.\n- **Lack of Sanitization:** The uploaded filename is not sanitized, allowing attackers to upload files with malicious extensions like `.php`.\n- **Directory Traversal (Implicit):** Although not explicitly directory traversal, the vulnerability allows the attacker to upload a file to a user-controlled directory.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading a PHP file containing malicious code, attackers can execute arbitrary code on the server.\n- **Full Server Compromise:** Successful exploitation could lead to a full server compromise, data breaches, malware installation, and other malicious activities.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP POST request to the `registration.php` page, including the malicious PHP file as the profile picture upload.\n- **Direct File Access:** After successful upload, the attacker directly accesses the uploaded PHP file via a web browser using a constructed URL.\n- **Query Parameter for Command Execution:** The PHP file is designed to execute commands provided through a URL query parameter.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Knowledge of vulnerable endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the `registration.php` endpoint and the upload mechanism used for the profile picture.\n- **Ability to craft HTTP requests:** The attacker must be able to craft and send HTTP POST requests, including file uploads.\n- **Access to the web application:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the application.\n\n**Technical Details:**\n- The vulnerable code snippet in `edit.php` (lines 36-37) is:\n```php\nmkdir(\"images/$e\");\nmove_uploaded_file($_FILES['img']['tmp_name'],\"images/$e/\".$_FILES['img']['name']);\n```\n- `$e` is the user's email address used to create the directory.\n- `$_FILES['img']['name']` is the original filename of the uploaded file, which is used as the filename on the server, without any validation or sanitization.\n- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) includes the HTTP POST request to upload a PHP file named `basic_webshell.php` containing the code `<?php @eval($_GET['attack']);?>`, and the method for accessing this file to achieve remote command execution.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The vulnerability is in the `online-notice-board-using-php` project, obtained from `code-projects.org`.\n- The described attack is a classic example of unrestricted file upload leading to Remote Code Execution.",

The **unrestricted upload** (CWE-434) creates an opportunity for an attacker to inject and execute code (CWE-94). The abstraction levels are appropriate, with CWE-434 being a Base weakness and CWE-94 a Base weakness, reflecting the specific nature of the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe434[\"CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\"]\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n    \n    cwe434 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe94\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe434 primary\n    class cwe94 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **unrestricted file upload** (CWE-434), which then allows the attacker to upload a malicious file containing code.

The key evidence lies in the description of the \"**unrestricted upload**\" vulnerability in the `/registration.php` file, allowing attackers to upload files with malicious extensions like `.php`. The provided code snippet `move_uploaded_file($_FILES['img']['tmp_name'],\"images/$e/\".$_FILES['img']['name']);` confirms the lack of validation or sanitization of the uploaded filename.\n\nThe retriever results indicated CWE-434 as a strong candidate, further supporting the initial assessment.
