Other CWEs considered were higher-level Classes or were related to different types of injection or weaknesses that didn't directly match the vulnerability description.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n    \n    cwe89 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe94 -->|PEEROF| cwe74\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe89 primary\n    class cwe74,cwe94 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain consists of:\n1.  Improper handling of input (`order` argument) in the `listData` function.\n2.  This leads to **SQL Injection** (CWE-89) because the input is not neutralized.\n3.  The impact is potential data breach or unauthorized access.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that manipulating the `order` argument in the `listData` function leads to **SQL Injection**. This aligns directly with CWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')). The Retriever results also strongly suggest CWE-89 as the primary candidate.\n\nThe evidence is strong: \"manipulation of the argument order leads to **sql injection**\".\n\nThe other CWEs considered were not as directly relevant:\n*   CWE-79 (Cross-Site Scripting) is for web page generation, not SQL commands.\n*   CWE-434 (Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type) relates to file uploads, which is not mentioned in the description.\n*   CWE-117 (Improper Output Neutralization for Logs) focuses on log output, not SQL commands.\n\nCWE-89 is the most specific and appropriate CWE for this vulnerability.",
