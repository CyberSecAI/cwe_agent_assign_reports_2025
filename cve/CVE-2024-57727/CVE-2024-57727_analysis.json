There's also a relationship with **Missing Authentication** CWE-306, since the path traversal can be exploited without authentication, leading to unauthorized access.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n\n    class cwe22 primary\n    class cwe306 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **missing authentication** (CWE-306), which allows an attacker to exploit the **path traversal** vulnerability (CWE-22). The end result is the ability to download arbitrary files containing sensitive information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, which indicates a **path traversal vulnerability** that allows unauthenticated attackers to download arbitrary files. The primary weakness is the **improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory** (CWE-22). The secondary weakness is the **missing authentication for critical function** (CWE-306), as the path traversal can be exploited without authentication. The graph relationships highlight the connection between the two weaknesses, with the missing authentication enabling the path traversal. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, as they accurately represent the nature of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
