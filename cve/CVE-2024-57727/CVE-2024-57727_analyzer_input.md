*   Exposure of secrets: LDAP credentials, OIDC client secrets, API keys, and TOTP seeds used for MFA could be exposed.

**Attack vectors:**

*   Network access: An attacker with network access to the SimpleHelp server can exploit the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   No authentication required.
*   Basic understanding of path traversal techniques.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   Upgrade to SimpleHelp version 5.5.8, 5.4.10, or 5.3.9.

**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**

*   The configuration file `serverconfig.xml` is encrypted, but with a hardcoded key.
*   The vulnerability was discovered during a security audit by Horizon3.ai.
*   Horizon3.ai notified SimpleHelp and they released patches.
*   The CVSSv3 score is 7.5 (High).
*   The content also details two other vulnerabilities (CVE-2024-57728 and CVE-2024-57726) affecting SimpleHelp.
