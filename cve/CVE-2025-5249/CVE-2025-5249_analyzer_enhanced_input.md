**Vulnerability details and POC**

*   **Vulnerability location:** "category" parameter
*   **Vulnerability Type:** SQL injection
*   **Root Cause:** A SQL injection vulnerability was identified within the "/admin/add-category.php" file of the "News Portal" project. The root cause lies in the fact that attackers can inject malicious code via the parameter "category". This input is then directly utilized in SQL queries without undergoing proper sanitization or validation processes. As a result, attackers are able to fabricate input values, manipulate SQL queries, and execute unauthorized operations.
*   **Impact:** Exploiting this SQL injection vulnerability allows attackers to gain unauthorized access to the database, cause sensitive data leakage, tamper with data, gain complete control over the system, and even disrupt services. This poses a severe threat to both the security of the system and the continuity of business operations.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The "category" parameter in the POST request to "/admin/add-category.php" can be used to inject malicious SQL queries.
*   **Payload:**
    *   Parameter: category (POST)
    *   Type: time-based blind
    *   Title: MySQL >= 5.0.12 AND time-based blind (query SLEEP)
    *   Payload: category=1' AND (SELECT 7973 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))okcn) AND 'TqGc'='TqGc&description=1&submit=
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No login or authorization is required to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Mitigation or fix:**
    1.  Employ prepared statements and parameter binding.
    2.  Conduct input validation and filtering.
    3.  Minimize database user permissions.
