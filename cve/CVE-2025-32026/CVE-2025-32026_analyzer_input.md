## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-32026 based on provided content:

**1. Verification:**

The content directly relates to CVE-2025-32026 as it explicitly states the CVE ID and provides details about a security vulnerability in Element Web.

**2. Extracted Information:**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Element Web, from versions 1.11.16 to 1.11.96, allows loading Element Call from an external URL. This external page can then access the media encryption keys used for Element Call.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The vulnerability stems from the ability to load Element Call from an untrusted external source, leading to potential key leakage.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Access to media encryption keys could compromise the confidentiality of Element Call communications.
*   **Attack vectors:** An attacker could host a malicious instance of Element Call and trick a user into loading it via Element Web.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious Element Call instance and potentially influence the user to load it.  The vulnerability requires a high level of privilege (PR:H) according to the CVSS score.
*   **Mitigation or fix:**
    *   Upgrade to version 1.11.97 or later.
    *   Configure Element Web to load Element Call from a trusted source.

*   The content provides a severity assessment (Moderate) and a CVSS score (3.8).
*   It includes contact information for reporting further questions (security@element.io).
*   It details the specific version range affected and the patched version.
*   It provides a workaround (loading a trusted instance of Element Call).
*   It explicitly states there are no CWEs identified.
