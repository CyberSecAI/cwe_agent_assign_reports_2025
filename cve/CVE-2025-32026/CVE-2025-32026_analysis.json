Verification:**\n\nThe content directly relates to CVE-2025-32026 as it explicitly states the CVE ID and provides details about a security vulnerability in Element Web.\n\n**2. Extracted Information:**\n\n*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Element Web, from versions 1.11.16 to 1.11.96, allows loading Element Call from an external URL. This external page can then access the media encryption keys used for Element Call.\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The vulnerability stems from the ability to load Element Call from an untrusted external source, leading to potential key leakage.\n*   **Impact of exploitation:** Access to media encryption keys could compromise the confidentiality of Element Call communications.\n*   **Attack vectors:** An attacker could host a malicious instance of Element Call and trick a user into loading it via Element Web.\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious Element Call instance and potentially influence the user to load it.  The vulnerability requires a high level of privilege (PR:H) according to the CVSS score.\n*   **Mitigation or fix:**\n    *   Upgrade to version 1.11.97 or later.\n    *   Configure Element Web to load Element Call from a trusted source.\n\n**3. Additional Details (compared to a potential official CVE description):**\n\n*   The content provides a severity assessment (Moderate) and a CVSS score (3.8).\n*   It includes contact information for reporting further questions (security@element.io).\n*   It details the specific version range affected and the patched version.\n*   It provides a workaround (loading a trusted instance of Element Call).\n*   It explicitly states there are no CWEs identified.\n\n**4. Response:**\n\nThe content is relevant and provides detailed information about the vulnerability. The extracted information is presented above.",
