Specifically, the `/wp-json/wp/v2/sensei_email` endpoint lists email template IDs, and `/wp-json/wp/v2/sensei_email/<TemplateID>` exposes the content of the templates.\n- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthorized disclosure of email templates, which may contain sensitive information.\n- **Attack vectors:** HTTP requests to vulnerable REST API endpoints without authentication.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the WordPress instance. They do not need to be authenticated.",
