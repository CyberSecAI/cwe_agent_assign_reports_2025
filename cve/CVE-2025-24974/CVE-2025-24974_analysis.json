  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-24974 based on provided content:\n\nThis content directly relates to CVE-2025-24974 and provides significantly more detail than a standard CVE description.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of JDBC connection parameters in the `io.dataease.datasource.type.Mysql` class. Specifically, the code does not prevent the use of the `maxAllowedPacket` parameter, which can be exploited to read arbitrary files on the server.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input (JDBC connection parameters).\n*   **Deserialization of Untrusted Data:** The ability to control JDBC parameters allows for potential deserialization of untrusted data, leading to arbitrary file read.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nAn authenticated user can read arbitrary files on the DataEase server.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   An attacker with authentication can modify the JDBC connection parameters to include `maxAllowedPacket`, triggering the file read vulnerability.\n*   The provided video (2025-01-23.19-09-11.mov) demonstrates the exploitation steps.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the DataEase application.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   Upgrade to version 2.10.6 or later, which includes a fix for this vulnerability.\n*   The fix involves adding `maxAllowedPacket` to the list of `illegalParameters` to prevent its use in the JDBC connection string.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n*   The vulnerable code is located in `io.dataease.datasource.type.Mysql`.\n*   The vulnerability affects versions <= 2.10.5.\n*   The vulnerability was reported by @hack-umbrella.\n*   The advisory provides contact information for reporting further issues (wei@fit2cloud.com) and opening an issue on the GitHub repository (<https://github.com/dataease/dataease>).\n*   The CVE ID is CVE-2025-24974.",
