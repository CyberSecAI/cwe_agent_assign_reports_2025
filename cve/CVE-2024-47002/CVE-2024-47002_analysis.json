The `vlan_id` parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML code.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   CWE-79 - Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation (\u2018Cross-site Scripting\u2019)\n*   Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nSuccessful exploitation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML code into the web page, potentially leading to:\n\n*   Execution of malicious scripts in the victim's browser.\n*   Stealing sensitive information (cookies, session tokens).\n*   Defacement of the web page.\n*   Redirection to malicious websites.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   An attacker needs to craft a malicious HTTP request with a specially crafted `vlan_id` parameter.\n*   The attacker must then trick a user into clicking a malicious link containing the crafted URL.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   The attacker does not need any special privileges to craft the malicious request.\n*   The attacker needs to be able to deliver the malicious link to a legitimate, authenticated user of the Observium instance.\n*   Authenticated user interaction is required (clicking a malicious link).\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   The vendor released a patch on December 24, 2024.\n*   Proper input validation and sanitization of the `vlan_id` parameter in `html/pages/vlan.inc.php` is required.\n\n**Confirmed Vulnerable Versions:**\n\n*   Observium CE 24.4.13528\n\n**CVSSv3 Score:**\n\n*   8.7 - CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   The vulnerable code is located in `html/pages/vlan.inc.php`.\n*   Example malicious URL: `http://192.168.0.40/vlan/?vlan_id=<LINK REL=\"stylesheet\" HREF=\"http://192.168.0.140:8000/very_evil.css\">`\n*   The report provides the full HTTP request and response examples.\n*   Discovered by Marcin 'Icewall' Noga of Cisco Talos.",

The vulnerability is due to **improper neutralization of input** during web page generation. |\n| CWE-80 | Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS) | 0.7 | Variant | Allowed | Secondary CWE. This is a more specific variant of XSS related to script-related HTML tags. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-79, which is a base-level CWE. CWE-80 is a variant of CWE-79, representing a more specific type of Cross-site Scripting. The selection of CWE-79 as primary is based on its direct match to the vulnerability description, while CWE-80 is considered due to the mention of HTML code injection, suggesting script-related tags are involved.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe80[\"CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\"]\n\n    cwe80 -->|CHILDOF| cwe79\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe79 primary\n    class cwe80 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper neutralization of input**, leading to the injection of arbitrary HTML code, which results in Cross-Site Scripting.\n  - Root Cause: **Improper Neutralization of Input** (CWE-79)\n  - Impact: Execution of malicious scripts, information stealing, defacement, redirection.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment, based on the vulnerability description and key phrases, strongly suggests CWE-79 as the primary weakness. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms this, explicitly stating that the vulnerability is due to **improper neutralization of input** during web page generation and identifying CWE-79 as a present weakness.
