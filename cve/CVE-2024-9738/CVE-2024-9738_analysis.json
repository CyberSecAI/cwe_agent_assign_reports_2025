CWE-787 is often preceded by an input validation issue, which is represented by the Class-level CWE-20. While CWE-20 is a parent, it is still relevant as the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data** is called out as the root cause.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe20 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe787\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe20 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data** (CWE-20) leading to a **memory corruption** condition from an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787), which allows for arbitrary code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability is a memory corruption issue due to a **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**. The primary CWE is CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write), as the description explicitly states the condition of **memory corruption** caused by writing past the end or before the beginning of the intended buffer. CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) is included as a secondary CWE, as it describes the root cause of the vulnerability. The evidence for this is from the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section: \"**rootcause:** **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**\".\n\nThe \"CWE for similar CVE Descriptions\" lists CWE-787 as the Primary CWE Match.\n\nCWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) was considered, but the vulnerability description doesn't specify whether the buffer is allocated on the heap. Therefore, CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is a more accurate and general representation of the vulnerability.\nCWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) was considered, but the vulnerability description explicitly mentions the condition of **memory corruption** due to writing, not reading, past the buffer.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-134: Use of Externally-Controlled Format String\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a function that accepts a format string as an argument, but the format string originates from an external source.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-788: Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads or writes to a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location after the end of the buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: The CWE entry might be misused when lower-level CWE entries might be available. It also overlaps existing CWE entries and might be deprecated in the future.\n\n\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).

CWE-787 is often preceded by an input validation issue, which is represented by the Class-level CWE-20. While CWE-20 is a parent, it is still relevant as the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data** is called out as the root cause.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe20 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe787\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe20 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data** (CWE-20) leading to a **memory corruption** condition from an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787), which allows for arbitrary code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability is a memory corruption issue due to a **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**. The primary CWE is CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write), as the description explicitly states the condition of **memory corruption** caused by writing past the end or before the beginning of the intended buffer. CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) is included as a secondary CWE, as it describes the root cause of the vulnerability. The evidence for this is from the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section: \"**rootcause:** **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**\".\n\nThe \"CWE for similar CVE Descriptions\" lists CWE-787 as the Primary CWE Match.\n\nCWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) was considered, but the vulnerability description doesn't specify whether the buffer is allocated on the heap. Therefore, CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is a more accurate and general representation of the vulnerability.\nCWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) was considered, but the vulnerability description explicitly mentions the condition of **memory corruption** due to writing, not reading, past the buffer.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-134: Use of Externally-Controlled Format String\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a function that accepts a format string as an argument, but the format string originates from an external source.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-788: Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads or writes to a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location after the end of the buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: The CWE entry might be misused when lower-level CWE entries might be available.
