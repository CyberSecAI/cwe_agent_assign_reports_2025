  "description": "WeGIA is a web manager for charitable institutions. An unauthenticated **SQL Injection vulnerability** was identified in versions up to and including 3.3.0 in the endpoint `/html/socio/sistema/get_socios.php`, specifically in the query parameter. This issue allows attackers to inject and execute arbitrary SQL statements against the applications underlying database. As a result, it may lead to data exfiltration, authentication bypass, or complete database compromise. Version 3.3.1 fixes the issue.",

Verification:**\n\nThe provided content directly relates to CVE-2025-46828 as it explicitly references the CVE ID and describes a vulnerability.\n\n**2. Extracted Information:**\n\n* **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by directly executing user-supplied SQL input from the POST parameter `query` without proper validation or sanitization in the `get_socios.php` endpoint. The use of `mysqli_query()` with unsanitized input is the core issue.\n* **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unauthenticated SQL Injection (CWE-89).\n* **Impact of exploitation:**\n    * Exfiltration of confidential data.\n    * Database compromise.\n* **Attack vectors:** Network-based, via POST request to the `/html/socio/sistema/get_socios.php` endpoint with a malicious `query` parameter.\n* **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No authentication required. The attacker can be remote. No specific privileges are needed. No user interaction is required.\n* **Mitigation or fix:** The content indicates the vulnerability was patched in version 3.3.1.  The fix involves proper input validation and sanitization before using the input in the `mysqli_query()` function.\n\n**3. Additional Details (compared to a placeholder CVE description):**\n\nThe provided content offers significantly more detail than a placeholder CVE description would. It includes:\n\n*   Specific file and function involved (`get_socios.php`, `mysqli_query()`).\n*   A code snippet demonstrating the vulnerable code.\n*   A Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrating the exploit.\n*   CVSS v4 scoring and metrics.\n*   Credits to the researchers who discovered and reported the vulnerability.\n*   Detailed explanation of CVSS metrics.",

The retriever results also strongly suggested CWE-89 as the most relevant. The other CWEs listed were either too high-level (Class) or related to different types of vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, OS Command Injection).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    \n    cwe89 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe89 primary\n    class cwe74 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command** (CWE-89) due to lack of input sanitization.\n2.  **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary SQL statements, potentially leading to data exfiltration, authentication bypass, or complete database compromise.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability is a classic case of SQL Injection. The description explicitly states that an **SQL Injection vulnerability** exists due to **improper neutralization** of input in the `query` parameter. The `CVE Reference Links Content Summary` confirms that user-supplied SQL input is directly executed without proper validation, leading to the vulnerability. Given the direct evidence and the high retriever score, CWE-89 is the most appropriate classification. It is a Base level CWE, which is the preferred level of abstraction.\n\nThe analysis is primarily based on the provided evidence, specifically the vulnerability description and CVE Reference Links Content Summary.\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
