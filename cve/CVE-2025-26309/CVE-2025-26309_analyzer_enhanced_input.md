## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-26309 Content

The provided content details a memory leak vulnerability in the `parseSWF_DEFINESCENEANDFRAMEDATA` function of libming version 0.4.8. This directly relates to a potential CVE as it describes a security weakness.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The `parseSWF_DEFINESCENEANDFRAMEDATA` function allocates memory for `Scenes` and `Frames` arrays using `malloc` but does not deallocate this memory, leading to memory leaks.  The `readString` function called within loops also contributes to memory leaks as its allocated memory is not freed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Memory Leak: Failure to free allocated memory.
*   Lack of Deallocation: Missing `free()` calls for allocated structures.

**Impact of exploitation:**

Repeated parsing of SWF files could lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition due to excessive memory consumption.

**Attack vectors:**

*   Providing a specially crafted SWF file to libming for parsing.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to provide a SWF file to the application using libming. No special privileges are required.

**Mitigation or fix:**

The vulnerability can be fixed by adding `free()` calls to deallocate the memory allocated for `parserrec->Scenes` and `parserrec->Frames` before the function returns. Additionally, the memory allocated by `readString` should be freed.

**More detail than official CVE description:**

Yes, the content provides significantly more detail than a typical CVE description. It includes:

*   Specific function name and line numbers where the vulnerability exists.
*   ASAN (AddressSanitizer) output demonstrating the memory leaks.
*   A proof-of-concept (PoC) file.
*   Code snippets illustrating the allocation without deallocation.
*   Detailed explanation of the root cause and impact.
