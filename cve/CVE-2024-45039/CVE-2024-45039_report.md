# Analysis Report for CVE-2024-45039

# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-45039

## Description

gnark is a fast zk-SNARK library that offers a high-level API to design circuits. Versions prior to 0.11.0 have a soundness issue - in case of **multiple commitments** used inside the circuit the prover is able to choose all but the last commitment. As gnark uses the commitments for optimized non-native multiplication, lookup checks etc. as random challenges, then it could impact the soundness of the whole circuit. However, using **multiple commitments** has been discouraged due to the additional cost to the verifier and it has not been supported in the recursive in-circuit Groth16 verifier and Solidity verifier. gnarks maintainers expect the impact of the issue be very small - only for the users who have implemented the native Groth16 verifier or are using it with **multiple commitments**. We do not have information of such users. The issue has been patched in version 0.11.0. As a workaround, users should follow gnark maintainers recommendation to use only a single commitment and then derive in-circuit commitments as needed using the `std/multicommit` package.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Weakness:** multiple commitments
- **Impact:** choose all but last commitment
- **Product:** gnark
- **Version:** prior to 0.11.0

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **CWE-335** | Incorrect Usage of Seeds in Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) | 0.7 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-330 | Use of Insufficiently Random Values | 0.6 | Class | Secondary Candidate | Discouraged |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship considered was that CWE-335 is a specific case of CWE-330, dealing with PRNGs, which are often related to the use of random values. However, the description focuses more on the misuse of commitments leading to manipulation of challenges, linking it closer to PRNG issues rather than just general randomness. The final selection favored the specific details related to random number generation processes.

## Vulnerability Chain
The chain starts with the **incorrect usage of multiple commitments** in the Groth16 proving system, which leads to the use of the same sigma value for all proofs of knowledge. This **weakness** allows a malicious prover to manipulate commitments and influence in-circuit challenges due to the misuse of randomness. The final impact is breaking the soundness of the zero-knowledge proof system.
  - Root Cause: CWE-335 Incorrect Usage of Seeds in Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG).
  - Impact: Malicious prover can construct a proof accepted by the verifier, manipulating committed values.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment focused on the **weakness** related to **multiple commitments** and their impact on the soundness of the zero-knowledge proof system. The retriever results and vulnerability description key phrases pointed to issues related to randomness. The final decision was to assign CWE-335 as the primary CWE because the vulnerability stems from using the same sigma value, which is akin to misusing a seed in a PRNG, enabling the manipulation of challenges. The evidence supporting this is the description stating that the commitments are used "as random challenges" and the root cause explanation that "the same Ïƒ (sigma) value is used for all proofs of knowledge." This indicates a flaw in how randomness is handled. The selection of CWE-335 is at the base level of specificity, addressing the root cause of the vulnerability.

**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly anticipate or handle exceptional conditions that rarely occur during normal operation of the product.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.

## CWE-696: Incorrect Behavior Order
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product performs multiple related behaviors, but the behaviors are performed in the wrong order in ways which may produce resultant weaknesses.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-252: Unchecked Return Value
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not check the return value from a method or function, which can prevent it from detecting unexpected states and conditions.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
