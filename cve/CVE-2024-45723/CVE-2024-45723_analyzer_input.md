# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-45723

## Vulnerability Description
The goTenna Pro ATAK Plugin **does not use SecureRandom when generating passwords for sharing cryptographic keys**. The random function in use makes it easier for attackers to brute force this password if the broadcasted encryption key is captured over RF. This only applies to the optional broadcast of an encryption key, so it is advised to share the key with local QR code for higher security operations.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content is related to CVE-2024-45723.

**Root Cause:** The goTenna Pro ATAK Plugin uses a cryptographically weak pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) when generating passwords for sharing cryptographic keys.

**Weaknesses:**
- Use of a non-secure random function instead of SecureRandom for password generation.
- This weakness makes it easier for attackers to brute-force the password if the broadcasted encryption key is captured over RF.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- If the broadcasted encryption key is captured over RF, and the password is cracked via brute force, an attacker can decrypt and use the key to decrypt all future and past messages sent via encrypted broadcast with that specific key. This compromises the confidentiality of the communications.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker needs to capture the broadcasted encryption key over RF.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be within RF range to capture the broadcasted key.
- The attacker needs the capability to perform a brute-force attack on the password.
- This vulnerability is only exploitable when the key is broadcasted over RF, which is an optional feature.

**Additional Notes:**
- It is advised to share the encryption key using a local QR code for higher security.
- The vulnerability is present in goTenna Pro ATAK Plugin versions 1.9.12 and prior.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v4 base score of 7.1 and CVSS v3.1 base score of 6.5.
