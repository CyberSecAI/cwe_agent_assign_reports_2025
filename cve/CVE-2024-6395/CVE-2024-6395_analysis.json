CWE-200 is a class-level CWE representing a broad category of information exposure. CWE-527 is a variant of CWE-200 and is more specific to version control repositories. The retriever results suggest CWE-200 due to the general \"exposure of sensitive information.\" However, the vulnerability is specifically related to a version control system (GitHub Enterprise Server), making CWE-527 a more precise but less confident fit.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe527[\"CWE-527: Exposure of Version-Control Repository to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\"]\n\n    cwe527 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe527 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an unspecified **weakness** in how GitHub Enterprise Server handles deploy keys, leading to the **impact** of exposing the names of private repositories.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **impact** of the vulnerability: the exposure of sensitive information (repository names).

While CWE-527 is more specific, the description doesn't provide enough detail to confidently classify it as such.
