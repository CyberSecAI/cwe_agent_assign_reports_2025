## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
```
**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A SQL injection vulnerability was identified within the "/admin/all-applications.php" file of the "Online Birth Certificate System" project. The root cause lies in the fact that attackers can inject malicious code via the parameter "del". This input is then directly utilized in SQL queries without undergoing proper sanitization or validation processes. As a result, attackers are able to fabricate input values, manipulate SQL queries, and execute unauthorized operations.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Exploiting this SQL injection vulnerability allows attackers to gain unauthorized access to the database, cause sensitive data leakage, tamper with data, gain complete control over the system, and even disrupt services. This poses a severe threat to both the security of the system and the continuity of business operations.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the "/admin/all-applications.php" file with a malicious payload in the "del" parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable file and inject malicious SQL code.

**Mitigation or fix:**
1. Employ prepared statements and parameter binding.
2. Conduct input validation and filtering.
3. Minimize database user permissions.
