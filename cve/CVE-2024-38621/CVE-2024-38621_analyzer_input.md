# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-38621

## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved media stk1160 fix bounds checking in stk1160_copy_video() The subtract in this condition is reversed. The ->length is the length of the buffer. The ->bytesused is how many bytes we have copied thus far. When the condition is reversed that means the result of the subtraction is always negative but since its unsigned then the result is a very high positive value. That means the overflow check is never true. Additionally, the ->bytesused doesnt actually work for this purpose because were not writing to buf->mem + buf->bytesused. Instead, the math to calculate the destination where we are writing is a bit involved. You calculate the number of full lines already written, multiply by two, skip a line if necessary so that we start on an odd numbered line, and add the offset into the line. To fix this **buffer overflow**, just take the actual destination where we are writing, if the offset is already out of bounds print an error and return. Otherwise, write up to buf->length bytes.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **subtract in condition is reversed**
- **weakness:** **buffer overflow**
- **product:** Linux kernel
- **component:** stk1160_copy_video()

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a flawed bounds check within the `stk1160_copy_video` function in the `stk1160` driver.
- The original code used `buf->bytesused - buf->length` to check for buffer overflow, but the subtraction was reversed, always resulting in a negative value which is then interpreted as a large positive value due to being an unsigned type. Consequently, the overflow check was ineffective. Additionally the bytesused parameter is not correct for the destination check as it does not represent the current write offset.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** The incorrect bounds check allowed writing beyond the allocated buffer's boundaries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Memory Corruption:** Writing outside the buffer's boundaries could lead to memory corruption. This could cause a variety of issues, including:
  - **System Instability:**  Potentially crashes or unexpected behavior.
  - **Arbitrary Code Execution:** If an attacker can control the overflowed data, it might be possible to execute malicious code.
  - **Denial of Service:** By corrupting critical data structures, an attacker could render the system unusable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through the `stk1160_copy_video` function when copying video data from the USB device into a buffer.
- An attacker could send specially crafted USB data to the device, which, when processed by the flawed copy function, would trigger a buffer overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Physical access to a device running a vulnerable kernel** that has an STK1160 device connected, or remote access if the USB device can be accessed remotely.
- **Ability to control the data stream:** The attacker needs to be able to send malicious data through the USB connection that results in a large amount of video data being copied to the buffer and trigger the out of bounds write.

**More Details:**
- The provided code snippets detail a fix that replaces the flawed size check. The fix directly calculates the current write offset from the start of the buffer and compares against the buffer's length. If the offset is out of bounds it returns an error, otherwise it limits the write length to the remaining bytes available.
- The vulnerability is located in the `drivers/media/usb/stk1160/stk1160-video.c` file.
- The fix uses `dev_warn_ratelimited` to print a warning if the offset is out of bounds.

The provided patches show a consistent change across multiple kernel trees. They all address the same incorrect bounds check using the same fix.
