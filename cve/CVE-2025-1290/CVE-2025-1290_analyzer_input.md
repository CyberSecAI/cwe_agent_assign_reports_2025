# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-1290

# Vulnerability Description

    A **race condition** **Use-After-Free vulnerability** exists in the virtio_transport_space_update function within the Kernel 5.4 on ChromeOS. Concurrent allocation and freeing of the virtio_vsock_sock structure during an AF_VSOCK connect syscall can occur before a worker thread accesses it resulting in a dangling pointer and potential kernel code execution.

    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'Use-After-Free vulnerability'

Relevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:

### 1. CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') (Score: 378.59)

The product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently....

### 2. CWE-667: Improper Locking (Score: 362.63)

The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors....

### 3. CWE-415: Double Free (Score: 332.62)

The product calls free() twice on the same memory address, potentially leading to modification of unexpected memory locations....

### 4. CWE-364: Signal Handler Race Condition (Score: 332.25)

The product uses a signal handler that introduces a race condition....

### 5. CWE-416: Use After Free (Score: 319.12)

The product reuses or references memory after it has been freed. At some point afterward, the memory may be allocated again and saved in another pointer, while the original pointer references a location somewhere within the new allocation. Any operations using the original pointer are no longer vali...
