Prior to commit c4f81d9616d40c60584e36abb15300853a66e489, the `vis_params` variable on line 80 in `8__Raster_Data_Visualization.py` takes user input, which is later used in the `eval()` function on line 86, leading to remote code execution.

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-41119:\n\n**CVE-2024-41119:** Remote code execution in `pages/8_\ud83c\udfdc\ufe0f_Raster_Data_Visualization.py`\n\n*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application uses the `eval()` function on user-provided input (`vis_params`) within the `pages/8_\ud83c\udfdc\ufe0f_Raster_Data_Visualization.py` file without proper sanitization.\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unsanitized user input is directly passed to the `eval()` function, allowing arbitrary code execution.\n*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can achieve remote code execution on the server hosting the streamlit-geospatial application, allowing them to potentially take full control of the system.\n*   **Attack vectors:** A remote attacker can send a malicious string through the `Enter visualization parameters` text area, which is then evaluated using the `eval()` function.\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to access the `pages/8_\ud83c\udfdc\ufe0f_Raster_Data_Visualization.py` page and input a malicious string into the `Enter visualization parameters` text area.\n\nThe provided information includes the following additional details:\n\n*   **Vulnerable code:** The `vis_params` variable on [line 80](https://github.com/opengeos/streamlit-geospatial/blob/4b89495f3bdd481998aadf1fc74b10de0f71c237/pages/8_%F0%9F%8F%9C%EF%B8%8F_Raster_Data_Visualization.py#L80) in `8_\ud83c\udfdc\ufe0f_Raster_Data_Visualization.py` takes user input, which is later used in the `eval()` function on [line 86](https://github.com/opengeos/streamlit-geospatial/blob/4b89495f3bdd481998aadf1fc74b10de0f71c237/pages/8_%F0%9F%8F%9C%EF%B8%8F_Raster_Data_Visualization.py#L86), leading to remote code execution.\n*   **Proof of Concept (PoC):**\n    1. Start streamlit-geospatial.\n    2. Go to the \ud83c\udfdc\ufe0f Raster Data Visualization tab and select `Add visualization parameters`.\n    3. Paste the following into `Enter visualization parameters`:\n    ```\n    __import__('code').InteractiveInterpreter().runsource('import os;os.system(\\\"echo $(uname -a) > foobar.txt\\\")')\n    ```\n    4.  Observe that a file `foobar.txt` has been created on the server, which contains the output of the `uname -a` command.\n*   **Fix:** The fix for this vulnerability involves replacing the usage of `eval()` with `json.loads()` after replacing single quotes with double quotes in the user input: `vis_params = json.loads(vis_params.replace(\"'\", '\"'))`.\n*   **Mitigation:** A whitelist of trusted URLs is implemented in the fix, and users can only input data that is a dictionary\n\nThe content provides more detail than a typical CVE description, including a detailed PoC and specific code locations.",
