  "description": "A flaw was found in grub2. When reading data from a squash4 filesystem, grubs squash4 fs module uses user-controlled parameters from the filesystem geometry to determine the internal buffer size, however, it improperly checks for **integer overflows**. A maliciously crafted filesystem may lead some of those buffer size calculations to overflow, causing it to perform a grub_malloc() operation with a smaller size than expected. As a result, the direct_read() will perform a **heap based out-of-bounds write** during data reading. This flaw may be leveraged to corrupt grubs internal critical data and may result in arbitrary code execution, by-passing secure boot protections.",

CWE-190 can precede CWE-787 in a vulnerability chain. Both CWEs are at the Base abstraction level.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe190[\"CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n\n    cwe190 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe787\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe190 primary\n    class cwe787 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **integer overflow (CWE-190)** during the calculation of a buffer size. This leads to the allocation of a smaller-than-expected buffer. Subsequently, when data is written to this buffer, it results in a **heap-based out-of-bounds write (CWE-787)**, potentially corrupting critical data and leading to arbitrary code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that an **integer overflow** occurs when calculating the buffer size, leading to a heap-based **out-of-bounds write**.\n\nEvidence: \"grubs squash4 fs module uses user-controlled parameters from the filesystem geometry to determine the internal buffer size, however, it improperly checks for **integer overflows**.
