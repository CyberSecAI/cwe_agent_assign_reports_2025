# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-48539

## Vulnerability Description
Neye3C v4.5.2.0 was discovered to contain a **hardcoded encryption key** in the firmware update mechanism.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **hardcoded encryption key**
- **product:** Neye3C
- **version:** v4.5.2.0
- **component:** firmware update mechanism

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of a hard-coded encryption key ("Goolink2014") within the `com.gooclient.anycam.activity.settings.update.UpdateFirmwareActivity2` component of the `neye3c v4.5.2.0` app. This key is used to encrypt and decrypt parameters when the application checks for firmware updates.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Hard-coded encryption key:** The primary weakness is the presence of the key "Goolink2014" directly within the application's code. This allows anyone with access to the APK to easily retrieve it.
*   **Insecure encryption:** The use of RC4 with a static key makes the encryption effectively useless against a determined attacker.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Information Leakage:** Attackers can decrypt sensitive information, including URLs and parameters used for firmware updates.
*   **Unauthorized Firmware Access:** Attackers can craft legitimate-looking network requests, potentially enabling them to download firmware, potentially malicious, without proper authorization.
*   **Parameter manipulation:** Attackers can use the key to encrypt their own crafted parameters, leading to potentially customized network requests that the application would accept.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **APK analysis:** By decompiling the application's APK using tools like JADX, the hardcoded key can be extracted.
*   **Network request interception:** Attackers can capture network traffic of the application to observe the encrypted parameters and understand the request structure, and use the extracted key to decrypt it.
*   **Malicious firmware injection:** By crafting and encrypting parameters with the hardcoded key, attackers could force the app to download and install malicious firmware.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Access to the APK file:** The attacker needs access to the application's APK file to decompile it and extract the hard-coded key.
*   **Understanding of network requests:** The attacker needs knowledge of the HTTP requests made by the app, the parameters used in those requests, and the encryption method employed.

**Additional Details:**
The provided content includes more detail than the typical CVE description. The report includes:
*   Specific class and method of the vulnerability within the app: `com.gooclient.anycam.activity.settings.update.UpdateFirmwareActivity2`
*   Step-by-step instructions on how to reproduce the vulnerability, including screenshots.
*   Examples of encrypted parameters and their decrypted forms.
*   Python RC4 script usage with the hard-coded key for decryption
*   The vulnerability report also suggests remediation steps, such as using configuration files or a key management system

The vendor, Huachuang Tech, is also identified. The application is referred to as "neye3c v4.5.2.0" and "V12APP" and is associated with camera monitoring and security.
