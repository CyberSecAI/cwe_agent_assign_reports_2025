Classified as Broken Access Control (OWASP Top 10 A1).\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\nA malicious actor can force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\nNot explicitly detailed, but inherent to CSRF - relies on tricking a logged-in user into performing an action on a malicious website.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\nUnauthenticated - no authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n- Patchstack has issued a virtual patch to mitigate the issue.\n- Remove and replace the software, as it is likely abandoned and will not receive further updates.\n- Deactivating the software does not remove the threat unless a vPatch is deployed.\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n- Vulnerable versions: <= 0.1\n- No official fix is currently available.\n- CVSS score: 7.1 (Medium)\n- Reported by 0xd4rk5id3 on December 5, 2024.\n- Published by Patchstack on April 14, 2025.\n- The software was last updated over a year ago and is likely abandoned.",
