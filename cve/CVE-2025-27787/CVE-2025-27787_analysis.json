  "description": "Applio is a voice conversion tool. Versions 3.2.8-bugfix and prior are vulnerable to denial of service (DoS) in restart.py. `model_name` in train.py takes user input, and passes it to the `stop_train` function in restart.py, which uses it construct a path to a folder with `config.json`. That `config.json` is opened and the list of values under process_pids are read. Next all the process IDs listed in the JSON are killed. Using one of the arbitrary file writes, one can write to `logs/foobar` a `config.json` file, which contains a list of process IDs. Then one can access this endpoint to kill these processes. Since an attacker cant know what process is running on which process ID, they can send a list of hundreds of process IDs, which can kill the process that applio is using to run, as well as other, potentially important processes, which leads to DoS. Note that constructing a path with user input also enables **path traversal**. For example, by supplying ../../ in `model_name` one can access `config.json` freom locations two folders down on the server. As of time of publication, no known patches are available.",

This file is then read to obtain a list of process IDs, which are subsequently killed.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **Path Traversal:** The use of user input in constructing the file path allows for path traversal vulnerabilities (e.g., using \u201c../../\u201d).\n*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can manipulate the `config.json` file to include a list of arbitrary process IDs, potentially killing critical system processes and causing a denial of service.\n*   **Unvalidated Input:** The `model_name` parameter is not properly validated, allowing an attacker to control the path to the `config.json` file.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nExploitation can lead to a denial of service by killing critical processes.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   An attacker can write a malicious `config.json` file to a location accessible via the `model_name` parameter.\n*   The attacker then calls the `stop_train` function with the crafted `model_name`, triggering the execution of `os.kill` on the provided process IDs.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\nThe attacker needs to be able to write to a location accessible by the application, and to call the `stop_train` function with a crafted `model_name`.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\nThe advisory does not specify a fix, but suggests input validation and sanitization of the `model_name` parameter to prevent path traversal and arbitrary file access.\n\n**Additional details (more detail than official CVE description):**\n\n*   The vulnerability exists in versions up to and including 3.2.7 of Applio.\n*   The vulnerable code is located in `tabs/settings/sections/restart.py` and `tabs/train/train.py`.\n*   The advisory provides code snippets illustrating the vulnerable code.\n*   The advisory details the coordinated disclosure timeline with the maintainer.",

The vulnerability description clearly states the presence of **path traversal**, and this CWE accurately captures that weakness. |\n| CWE-434 | Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate. The vulnerability allows for arbitrary file writes, potentially including dangerous file types, which aligns with this CWE. |\n| CWE-770 | Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling | 0.5 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate. The attacker can send a list of hundreds of process IDs, which can kill the process that applio is using to run, as well as other, potentially important processes, which leads to DoS. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\n\nThe primary relationship that influenced the decision was the parent-child relationship between CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) and CWE-22.

This allows an attacker to access arbitrary `config.json` files, which contain process IDs. By manipulating these files, an attacker can then cause a denial of service (DoS) by killing processes (CWE-434 and CWE-770).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe primary CWE selected is CWE-22 because the vulnerability description and CVE reference links explicitly mention **path traversal**. The `stop_train` function's use of user-supplied input (`model_name`) to construct a file path without proper sanitization allows for the **exploitation** of the **path traversal vulnerability**, enabling access to sensitive files outside the intended directory.\n\nCWE-434 and CWE-770 are secondary considerations. The ability to write arbitrary files relates to CWE-434, while the ability to kill arbitrary processes leading to DoS suggests CWE-770. However, these are impacts of the **path traversal** rather than the root cause.\n\nThe evidence for **path traversal** is strong: \"Note that constructing a path with user input also enables **path traversal**.
