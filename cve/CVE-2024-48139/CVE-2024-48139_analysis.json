  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-48139:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n- The vulnerability is a prompt injection in Blackbox AI v1.3.95. This means that a malicious user can craft a specific prompt that will be processed by the AI in unintended ways.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- Lack of proper input sanitization and validation of prompts provided to the AI. This allows specially crafted prompts to be interpreted as commands rather than natural language.\n- The AI assistant processes user inputs without sufficient safeguards, allowing attackers to manipulate its behavior.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- **Data Leak:** An attacker can access and exfiltrate all previous and subsequent chat data between the user and the AI assistant.\n- **Persistent Data Leak:** This data leak is persistent, meaning the attacker can continuously collect the chat data if the malicious prompt is not removed.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- The attack vector is through a maliciously crafted prompt injected directly into the Blackbox AI extension's chat window.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the Blackbox AI extension through the chat window.\n- No special privileges or permissions are mentioned, indicating any user with access to the chat interface could potentially exploit this vulnerability.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n- The provided text mentions the attacker can send collected information to attacker-controlled site.\n- The vulnerability was discovered in October 2024.\n- The vulnerability impacts version 1.3.95 of Blackbox AI.",

CWE-20 is a higher-level class related to improper input validation. CWE-116 relates to encoding and escaping output.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1427[\"CWE-1427: Improper Neutralization of Input Used for LLM Prompting\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe116[\"CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\"]\n    \n    cwe1427 -->|PARENT_OF, RELATED| cwe20\n    cwe116 -->|RELATED| cwe1427\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1427 primary\n    class cwe20,cwe116 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **Improper Neutralization of Input Used for LLM Prompting (CWE-1427)**, which allows an attacker to inject malicious prompts. This leads to the impact of data leakage, where the attacker can access and exfiltrate chat data.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-1427 because the vulnerability is a **prompt injection vulnerability**. The vulnerability description and CVE details explicitly state the **root cause** is the lack of proper input sanitization and validation of prompts provided to the AI. This allows crafted prompts to be interpreted as commands rather than natural language. The selection of CWE-1427 is further supported by its base-level abstraction and allowed usage.\n\nThe retriever results strongly suggest CWE-1427 as the most relevant, with a high score. The evidence and vulnerability description support the selection of CWE-1427 due to the presence of a **prompt injection vulnerability** which is the root cause.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
