## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-48139:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a prompt injection in Blackbox AI v1.3.95. This means that a malicious user can craft a specific prompt that will be processed by the AI in unintended ways.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of proper input sanitization and validation of prompts provided to the AI. This allows specially crafted prompts to be interpreted as commands rather than natural language.
- The AI assistant processes user inputs without sufficient safeguards, allowing attackers to manipulate its behavior.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Data Leak:** An attacker can access and exfiltrate all previous and subsequent chat data between the user and the AI assistant.
- **Persistent Data Leak:** This data leak is persistent, meaning the attacker can continuously collect the chat data if the malicious prompt is not removed.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a maliciously crafted prompt injected directly into the Blackbox AI extension's chat window.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the Blackbox AI extension through the chat window.
- No special privileges or permissions are mentioned, indicating any user with access to the chat interface could potentially exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided text mentions the attacker can send collected information to attacker-controlled site.
- The vulnerability was discovered in October 2024.
- The vulnerability impacts version 1.3.95 of Blackbox AI.
