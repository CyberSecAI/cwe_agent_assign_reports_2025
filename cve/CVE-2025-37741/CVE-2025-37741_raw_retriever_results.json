  "query": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved jfs Prevent copying of nlink with value 0 from disk inode syzbot report a deadlock in diFree. [1] When calling ioctl$LOOP_SET_STATUS64, the offset value passed in is 4, which does not match the mounted loop device, causing the mapping of the mounted loop device to be invalidated. When creating the directory and creating the inode of iag in diReadSpecial(), read the page of fixed disk inode (AIT) in raw mode in read_metapage(), the metapage data it returns is corrupted, which causes the nlink value of 0 to be assigned to the iag inode when executing copy_from_dinode(), which ultimately causes a deadlock when entering diFree(). To avoid this, first check the nlink value of dinode before setting iag inode.
