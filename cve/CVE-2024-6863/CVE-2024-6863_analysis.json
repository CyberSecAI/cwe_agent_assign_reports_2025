  "description": "In h2oai/h2o-3 version 3.46.0, an **endpoint exposing a custom EncryptionTool** allows an attacker to encrypt any files on the target server with a key of their choosing. The chosen key can also be overwritten, resulting in ransomware-like behavior. This vulnerability makes it possible for an attacker to encrypt arbitrary files with keys of their choice, making it exceedingly difficult for the target to recover the keys needed for decryption.",

The vulnerability involves an endpoint exposing a custom EncryptionTool, allowing an attacker to encrypt files with a key of their choosing. This directly relates to the use of cryptographic keys, and in this case, the ability to set or overwrite them. |\n| CWE-306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary candidate. The vulnerability description suggests that the endpoint exposing the encryption tool lacks proper authentication, allowing unauthorized access. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship that influenced the CWE selection was that CWE-321 is a variant-level CWE, providing a more specific description of the vulnerability than its parent classes. CWE-306 was considered as a secondary issue, because **missing authentication** is often a contributing factor in exploitable vulnerabilities where critical functions can be accessed without proper authorization.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe321[\"CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    \n    cwe321 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe321 primary\n    class cwe306 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **endpoint exposing a custom EncryptionTool**. The **lack of proper authentication (CWE-306)** allows an attacker to access this endpoint. The attacker can then **use or overwrite the cryptographic key (CWE-321)**. This leads to the **impact of encrypting arbitrary files with keys of their choice**, resulting in **ransomware-like behavior**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **endpoint exposing a custom EncryptionTool** and the ability to encrypt files with attacker-controlled keys. The Retriever Results and Complete CWE Specifications led to the selection of CWE-321 (Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key) as the primary CWE, because the attacker could overwrite the key. The vulnerability description highlights the severity of the impact, making it exceedingly difficult for the target to recover the keys needed for decryption. This is the core of the **ransomware-like behavior**. The selection is also influenced by the fact that CWE-321 is a Variant, which is a preferred level of abstraction.\n\nCWE-306 was considered a secondary candidate because **missing authentication** for the endpoint would be a prerequisite for exploiting the ability to set the cryptographic key.\n\nOther CWEs Considered:\n*   CWE-1394 (Use of Default Cryptographic Key): While related to cryptographic keys, it does not accurately describe the vulnerability where an attacker can *set* the key.\n*   CWE-327 (Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm): This is not applicable because the vulnerability is not related to the algorithm itself, but to the ability to control the key.\n*   CWE-203 (Observable Discrepancy) and CWE-208 (Observable Timing Discrepancy): These are not directly related to the core issue of key control and encryption.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
