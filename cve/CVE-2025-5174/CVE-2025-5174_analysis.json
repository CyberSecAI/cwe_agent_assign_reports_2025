  "description": "A vulnerability was found in erdogant pypickle up to 1.1.5 and classified as problematic. Affected by this issue is the function load of the file pypickle/pypickle.py. The manipulation leads to **deserialization**. Local access is required to approach this attack. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. Upgrading to version 2.0.0 is able to address this issue. The patch is identified as 14b4cae704a0bb4eb6723e238f25382d847a1917. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component.",

This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code by supplying a malicious pickle file.\n\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities present:\n- Insecure deserialization: Using `pickle.load()` without proper input validation.\n- Lack of input sanitization: The code does not validate or sanitize the data being deserialized.\n\nImpact of exploitation:\n- Arbitrary code execution\n- Remote system compromise\n\nAttack vectors:\n- An attacker can create a malicious pickle file and trick a user into loading it using the `pypickle.load()` function.\n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position:\n- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious pickle file to the system where the `pypickle` library is used.\n\nMitigation or fix:\n- The release 2.0.0 introduces validation steps to check for high-risk modules before loading pickle files.\n- The `validate` parameter can be used to explicitly allow risky modules or disable validation (not recommended).\n- The `validate_modules` function can be used to check the modules in a pickle file without loading it.\n- Restrictions on saving pickle files to specific locations (home and temp directories are safe by default).\n- Path traversal detection to prevent saving to system-critical paths.\n- File extension validation (.pkl, .pickle, .pklz, .pbz2).\n```",

        "extended_description": "\n\nThis weakness can lead to a vulnerability in environments in which the attacker does not have direct access to the operating system, such as in web applications. Alternately, if the weakness occurs in a privileged program, it could allow the attacker to specify commands that normally would not be accessible, or to call alternate commands with privileges that the attacker does not have. The problem is exacerbated if the compromised process does not follow the principle of least privilege, because the attacker-controlled commands may run with special system privileges that increases the amount of damage.\n\n\nThere are at least two subtypes of OS command injection:\n\n\n  - The application intends to execute a single, fixed program that is under its own control. It intends to use externally-supplied inputs as arguments to that program. For example, the program might use system(\"nslookup [HOSTNAME]\") to run nslookup and allow the user to supply a HOSTNAME, which is used as an argument. Attackers cannot prevent nslookup from executing. However, if the program does not remove command separators from the HOSTNAME argument, attackers could place the separators into the arguments, which allows them to execute their own program after nslookup has finished executing.\n\n  - The application accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run, as well as which commands to use. The application simply redirects this entire command to the operating system. For example, the program might use \"exec([COMMAND])\" to execute the [COMMAND] that was supplied by the user. If the COMMAND is under attacker control, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or programs. If the command is being executed using functions like exec() and CreateProcess(), the attacker might not be able to combine multiple commands together in the same line.\n\nFrom a weakness standpoint, these variants represent distinct programmer errors. In the first variant, the programmer clearly intends that input from untrusted parties will be part of the arguments in the command to be executed. In the second variant, the programmer does not intend for the command to be accessible to any untrusted party, but the programmer probably has not accounted for alternate ways in which malicious attackers can provide input.",
