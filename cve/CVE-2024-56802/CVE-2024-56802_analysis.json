  "description": "Tapir is a private Terraform registry. Tapir versions 0.9.0 and 0.9.1 are facing a critical issue with scope-able Deploykeys where attackers can guess the key to get write access to the registry. User must upgrade to 0.9.2.",

  },
  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from how DeployKeys were being retrieved by value in Tapir versions 0.9.0 and 0.9.1. The system was not performing an exact match when searching for a DeployKey by its value. Instead it was retrieving the first key that matched the provided value, allowing partial key matches.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Insecure Key Retrieval:** The primary weakness is that the `getDeployKeyByValue` method in the `DynamodbRepository`, `CosmosDbRepository` and `ElasticSearchRepository` classes did not enforce an exact match of the key value. This allowed an attacker to potentially gain access with a substring of a valid deploy key.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Unauthorized Write Access:** An attacker could potentially guess a deploy key (or a substring) and use it to gain write access to the registry, which could allow them to push malicious images or make other unauthorized changes.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Key Guessing:** An attacker could attempt to guess a valid DeployKey by trying various substrings.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Knowledge of Deploy Key Format:** The attacker would need some knowledge or ability to guess the structure of the deploy keys.\n*  **Network Access:** The attacker would need network access to interact with the registry API.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n*   The vulnerability is fixed in version 0.9.2 by adding a filter to ensure an exact match of the deploy key when retrieving it by value. The fix is implemented in the `DynamodbRepository.java`, `CosmosDbRepository.java` and `ElasticSearchRepository.java` files.\n* The provided commit also includes tests to verify this fix.\n* The vulnerability is rated as high severity.",

This CWE is a higher-level abstraction of the authorization issue. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-639 Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key, which is a base level CWE.

Since CWE-639 is a more specific description of the root cause, it is preferred.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe639 -->|CHILDOF| cwe863\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe639 primary\n    class cwe863 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **insecure key retrieval** mechanism, where the system does not enforce an exact match of the key value. This leads to the ability to **guess the key**, which in turn leads to **unauthorized write access** to the registry.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary vulnerability is an **Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key (CWE-639)**. The system **does not properly** validate the entire key, which enables an attacker to guess it, thus bypassing authorization. The evidence is in the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" in that the `getDeployKeyByValue` method **did not enforce an exact match** allowing access with a substring. This directly corresponds to CWE-639's description of gaining access by modifying the key value.\n\nCWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) was considered as a broader classification, but CWE-639 provides a more precise description of the vulnerability, focusing on the user-controlled key aspect.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.67\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.66\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.66\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1286: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.66\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input that is expected to be well-formed - i.e., to comply with a certain syntax - but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input complies with the syntax.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.66\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product establishes a communication channel to (or from) an endpoint for privileged or protected operations, but it does not properly ensure that it is communicating with the correct endpoint.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.66\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.66\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product generates an error message that includes sensitive information about its environment, users, or associated data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.66\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
