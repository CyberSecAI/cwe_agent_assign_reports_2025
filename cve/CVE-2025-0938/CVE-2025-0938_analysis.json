The vulnerability description and CVE summary explicitly state that the `urllib.parse.urlsplit` and `urlparse` functions **accepted domain names with square brackets**, which is invalid. The evidence clearly supports this classification.\n\nThe retriever results also suggested CWE-1286, further strengthening the confidence in this selection. The relationship analysis confirmed that CWE-1286 is a more specific instance of CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation), making it the preferred choice.\n\nThe final decision is based on the provided evidence, the retriever results, and the relationship analysis.
