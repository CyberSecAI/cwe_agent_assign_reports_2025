    ## WEAKNESS: 'heap overflow'

Relevant CWEs for this WEAKNESS:

### 1. CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound (Score: 283.58)

The product performs a calculation that can
         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic
         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than
         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is
         incremented to a value that is too large to st...

### 2. CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow (Score: 262.91)

A heap overflow condition is a buffer overflow, where the buffer that can be overwritten is allocated in the heap portion of memory, generally meaning that the buffer was allocated using a routine such as malloc()....

### 3. CWE-193: Off-by-one Error (Score: 256.98)

A product calculates or uses an incorrect maximum or minimum value that is 1 more, or 1 less, than the correct value....

### 4. CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input (Score: 251.60)

The product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties....

### 5. CWE-195: Signed to Unsigned Conversion Error (Score: 250.44)

The product uses a signed primitive and performs a cast to an unsigned primitive, which can produce an unexpected value if the value of the signed primitive can not be represented using an unsigned primitive....
