The vulnerability occurs due to a **missing capability check** on a function, allowing unauthorized access. |\n| CWE-22 | Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') | 0.8 | Base | Allowed | Secondary candidate. The **missing authorization** leads to a **path traversal** vulnerability. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary weakness is the **missing authorization** (CWE-862), which allows attackers to perform **path traversal** (CWE-22). CWE-862 is a class-level CWE, and more specific base-level CWEs might exist, but based on the provided information, it is an appropriate fit. CWE-22 is a base-level CWE, representing the **path traversal** that results from the authorization failure. The relationship between these CWEs can be seen as CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) can lead to CWE-22 (Path Traversal).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\"]\n    \n    cwe22 -- CANFOLLOW --> cwe862\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe22 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **missing authorization** (CWE-862) in the `wfu_ajax_action_read_subfolders` function. This **missing authorization** leads to a **path traversal** vulnerability (CWE-22), allowing authenticated attackers to view directories and subdirectories in WordPress.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-862 as the primary root cause due to the **missing capability check**, which perfectly aligns with the description of **missing authorization**. The resulting **path traversal** is best represented by CWE-22. The retriever results supported this assessment, with CWE-22 and CWE-862 appearing as top candidates. The relationship analysis shows that the **missing authorization** directly leads to the **path traversal**, making them a natural fit in the vulnerability chain. The final selection is based on the provided evidence, relationship analysis, and mapping guidance.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as
