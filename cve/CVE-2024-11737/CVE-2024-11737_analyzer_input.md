        not validate or incorrectly validates that the input has the
        properties that are required to process the data safely and
        correctly....

### 2. CWE-1285: Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input (Score: 273.87)

The product receives input that is expected to specify an index, position, or offset into an indexable resource such as a buffer or file, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the specified index/position/offset has the required properties....

### 3. CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input (Score: 269.51)
