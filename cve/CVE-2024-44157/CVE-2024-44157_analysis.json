CWE-121 is a more specific case of CWE-119 where the buffer is located on the stack. The relationship is ChildOf, and selecting the child (CWE-121) provides a more precise classification.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe121[\"CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    \n    cwe121 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe121 primary\n    class cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with insufficient input validation, leading to a stack buffer overflow, and culminating in unexpected system termination.\n\nInsufficient Input Validation -> Stack Buffer Overflow -> Unexpected System Termination\n\nThe primary CWE (CWE-121) represents the core vulnerability, the stack buffer overflow.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and CVE reference links. The vulnerability description clearly states \"stack buffer overflow,\" and the CVE reference summary confirms that the root cause is a stack buffer overflow due to insufficient input validation.\n\nThe graph relationship analysis confirms that CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow) is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). Selecting CWE-121 provides a more specific classification, as the vulnerability specifically involves a stack-based buffer.\n\nThe selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly reflects the type of buffer overflow described in the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.67\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-843: Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.67\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates or initializes a resource such as a pointer, object, or variable using one type, but it later accesses that resource using a type that is incompatible with the original type.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.66\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs a calculation that can\n         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic\n         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than\n         the original value.
