Attackers can inject malicious SQL code into this parameter, which is then used directly in SQL queries without proper sanitization or validation.\n*   **Impact:** Attackers can achieve unauthorized database access, leading to data leakage, modification, deletion, and potential system control, including service interruption.\n*   **Attack Vector:** The attack vector is the `mobilenumber` parameter.\n*   **Attack Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted HTTP request to `/admin-profile.php`, injecting malicious SQL code into the `mobilenumber` parameter. No login or authorization is required to exploit this vulnerability.\n*   **Mitigation/Fix:**\n    *   Use prepared statements and parameter binding.\n    *   Implement input validation and filtering.\n    *   Minimize database user permissions.\n    *   Conduct regular security audits.\n*   **More Detail:** This content provides significantly more detail than the official CVE description, including a vulnerability description, root cause, impact, attack vector, attack capabilities, and suggested fixes. It also provides a proof-of-concept (POC) payload and screenshots from the sqlmap tool.\n```",

The vulnerability is due to the **lack of input validation** on the `mobilenumber` parameter, which leads to **SQL injection**. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship considered was the parent-child relationship within the CWE hierarchy. CWE-89 is a base-level CWE, providing a specific description of the **SQL Injection** vulnerability. More general CWEs like CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')) were considered but deemed too abstract. The graph relationships show that CWE-89 can be preceded by other weaknesses related to input validation or data handling, but in this case, the description focuses on the direct impact of the **SQL Injection** vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    \n    cwe89 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe89 primary\n    class cwe74 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper neutralization** of the `mobilenumber` parameter, leading directly to **SQL injection**. This allows attackers to manipulate SQL queries, potentially leading to unauthorized database access, data leakage, modification, deletion, and even system control.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis strongly supports CWE-89 as the primary CWE. The evidence from the vulnerability description and the CVE reference links clearly indicates an **SQL injection** vulnerability due to the **lack of input validation** on the `mobilenumber` parameter in `/admin-profile.php`. The retriever results also highlight CWE-89 as the top match. The description explicitly mentions the manipulation of the `mobilenumber` argument leading to **SQL injection**, which aligns perfectly with the CWE-89 definition. \"The vulnerability is caused by a **lack of input validation** for the `mobilenumber` parameter. Attackers can inject malicious SQL code into this parameter, which is then used directly in SQL queries without proper sanitization or validation.\"\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.
