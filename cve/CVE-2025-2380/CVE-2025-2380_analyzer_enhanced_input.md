## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
```
*   **Vulnerability:** SQL injection
*   **Affected File:** `/admin-profile.php`
*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is caused by a lack of input validation for the `mobilenumber` parameter. Attackers can inject malicious SQL code into this parameter, which is then used directly in SQL queries without proper sanitization or validation.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can achieve unauthorized database access, leading to data leakage, modification, deletion, and potential system control, including service interruption.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attack vector is the `mobilenumber` parameter.
*   **Attack Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted HTTP request to `/admin-profile.php`, injecting malicious SQL code into the `mobilenumber` parameter. No login or authorization is required to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Mitigation/Fix:**
    *   Use prepared statements and parameter binding.
    *   Implement input validation and filtering.
    *   Minimize database user permissions.
    *   Conduct regular security audits.
*   **More Detail:** This content provides significantly more detail than the official CVE description, including a vulnerability description, root cause, impact, attack vector, attack capabilities, and suggested fixes.
