This could lead to a complete compromise of the application, including unauthorized access to data, modification of system configurations, and potential takeover of the server.\\n\\n**Attack Vectors:**\\n*   **Crafted URL:** Attackers can exploit the CSRF vulnerability by crafting malicious URLs that, when visited by an authenticated user, will execute the arbitrary scripts.\\n*   **XSS:** Attackers can also leverage an existing XSS vulnerability to execute malicious javascript that triggers the execution of arbitrary code through the vulnerable script console.\\n\\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\\n*   **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can be a remote user.\\n*   **User Interaction:** The attack requires a victim to be authenticated and to either visit a crafted URL or be affected by an XSS vulnerability on a page of the portal.\\n\\n**Affected Versions:**\\n*   Liferay Portal 7.4.0 through 7.4.3.101\\n*   Liferay Portal 7.3.0 through 7.3.7\\n*   Liferay Portal 7.2.0 through 7.2.1\\n*   Liferay Portal 7.1.0 through 7.1.3\\n*  Liferay Portal 7.0.0 through 7.0.6\\n*   Liferay DXP 2023.Q3.1 through 2023.Q3.4\\n*   Liferay DXP 7.4\\n*   Liferay DXP 7.3 GA through Update 35\\n*   Liferay DXP 7.2\\n*  Liferay DXP 7.1\\n*   Liferay DXP 7.0\\n*  Liferay DXP 6.2\\n\\n**Fixed Versions:**\\n*   Liferay Portal 7.4.3.102\\n*   Liferay DXP 2024.Q1.1\\n*   Liferay DXP 2023.Q4.0\\n*   Liferay DXP 2023.Q3.5\\n*   Liferay DXP 7.3 Update 36\\n\\nThe content provides more details than a typical CVE description by listing the specific affected and fixed versions of Liferay Portal and DXP.\", similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {}, 'top_cwes_by_threshold': {}}}, similarity_summary=SimilarityInsight(consensus_cwe='', top_cwes=[], confidence_levels={}, total_samples=0), analysis='', analysis_with_relationships='', criticism='', resolution='', relevant_cwes=[{'metadata': {'doc_id': '352', 'name': 'Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'rootcause:does not sufficiently protect against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks', 'keyphrase': 'does not sufficiently protect against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'weakness:XSS vulnerability', 'keyphrase': 'XSS vulnerability', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'weakness:cross-site scripting', 'keyphrase': 'cross-site scripting', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'impact:execute arbitrary Groovy script', 'keyphrase': 'execute arbitrary Groovy script', 'type': 'impact'}, {'id': 'vector:crafted URL', 'keyphrase': 'crafted URL', 'type': 'vector'}, {'id': 'attacker:remote attackers', 'keyphrase': 'remote attackers', 'type': 'attacker'}, {'id': \"product:'Liferay DXP']\", 'keyphrase': \"'Liferay DXP']\", 'type': 'product'}, {'id': \"version:['7.0.0 through 7.4.3.101'\", 'keyphrase': \"['7.0.0 through 7.4.3.101'\", 'type': 'version'}, {'id': \"version:'2023.Q3.1 through 2023.Q3.4']\", 'keyphrase': \"'2023.Q3.1 through 2023.Q3.4']\", 'type': 'version'}, {'id': 'component:Script Console', 'keyphrase': 'Script Console', 'type': 'component'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(646.561931836259)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '89', 'name': \"Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\", 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.
