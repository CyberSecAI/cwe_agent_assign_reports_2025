## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the ProfilePress plugin's content restriction mechanism, specifically when interacting with the WordPress core search functionality. The plugin fails to properly prevent the exposure of restricted content through search results.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Unauthenticated Content Restriction Bypass:** The core issue is that the plugin's content restriction is bypassed by the WordPress search feature.
- **Sensitive Information Exposure:**  Due to the bypass, content intended for higher-level roles (e.g., administrators) becomes accessible to unauthenticated users through search.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Exposure of Sensitive Data:** Unauthenticated attackers can gain unauthorized access to sensitive information contained within restricted posts, such as administrator-level content and settings.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **WordPress Core Search:** The attack vector involves leveraging the WordPress core search functionality to retrieve restricted content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Unauthenticated User:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability; it can be exploited by any unauthenticated user.
- **No special user capabilities required:** The attacker needs no special capabilities beyond the ability to access the website.

**Additional Notes**
