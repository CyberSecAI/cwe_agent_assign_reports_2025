Several more specific CWEs like CWE-770 **Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling** and CWE-789 **Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value** are related to it. CWE-770 and CWE-789 are potential root causes of CWE-400. The abstraction levels influenced the choice, leaning towards the higher-level CWE-400 to capture the general nature of the resource consumption issue while acknowledging the potential for more specific root causes.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe789[\"CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\"]\n    \n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    cwe789 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe400 primary\n    class cwe770,cwe789 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption** (CWE-400), potentially caused by excessive memory allocation (CWE-789) or lack of limits on resource allocation (CWE-770). The impact is Denial of Service (DoS). The initial flaw is the **uncontrolled resource consumption**, which leads to the system crashing and becoming unavailable.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-400 **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption** as the primary weakness, supported by the vulnerability description and the CVE reference summary, which explicitly mentions **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption**.\n\nThe retriever results also listed CWE-400 as the top candidate. The graph relationships highlight that CWE-770 **Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling** and CWE-789 **Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value** could be potential causes of CWE-400.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at an appropriate level of specificity, with CWE-400 representing the general weakness and CWE-770 and CWE-789 representing potential underlying causes related to memory allocation or resource management.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification)\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly control situations in which an adversary can cause the product to consume or produce excessive resources without requiring the adversary to invest equivalent work or otherwise prove authorization, i.e., the adversary's influence is \"asymmetric.\"\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-610: Externally Controlled Reference to a Resource in Another Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an externally controlled name or reference that resolves to a resource that is outside of the intended control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
