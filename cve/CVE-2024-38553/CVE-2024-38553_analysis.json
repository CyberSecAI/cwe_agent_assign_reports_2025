  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved net fec remove .ndo_poll_controller to avoid **deadlock**s There is a **deadlock** issue found in sungem driver, please refer to the commit ac0a230f719b (eth sungem remove .ndo_poll_controller to avoid **deadlock**s). The root cause of the issue is that **netpoll is in atomic context and disable_irq() is called by .ndo_poll_controller interface** of sungem driver, however, disable_irq() might sleep. After analyzing the implementation of fec_poll_controller(), the fec driver should have the same issue. Due to the fec driver uses NAPI for TX completions, the .ndo_poll_controller is unnecessary to be implemented in the fec driver, so fec_poll_controller() can be safely removed.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe root cause is the improper use of `disable_irq()` within the `fec_poll_controller()` function when called in the context of netpoll. `disable_irq()` can sleep, which is not allowed in an atomic context such as netpoll, leading to a potential deadlock.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n- The `fec_poll_controller` function calls `disable_irq()` and `enable_irq()` which can sleep, and are not safe in atomic context.\n- The driver implements a `.ndo_poll_controller` which is not required since NAPI is used for TX completions\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- Deadlock: The primary impact is a potential deadlock when `fec_poll_controller()` is called from an atomic context, such as when using netpoll for debugging or similar situations. This can make the system unresponsive.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- Netpoll: The vulnerability is triggered when the `fec_poll_controller()` function is called in the context of netpoll. This commonly happens during system debugging and console output scenarios via the network.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- The attacker does not need to be in a privileged position, but must be able to trigger netpoll, typically by activating network debugging or related scenarios.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The fix is to remove the unnecessary `.ndo_poll_controller` implementation from the FEC driver, which eliminates the problematic `disable_irq()` calls in the `fec_poll_controller()` function, because the FEC driver uses NAPI for TX completions, which makes the `.ndo_poll_controller` unnecessary.\n- This issue is similar to a deadlock that was found in the `sungem` driver.",

The description explicitly states that the vulnerability leads to a **deadlock** due to the improper use of `disable_irq()` within an atomic context.\n\nThe selection of CWE-833 is based on the direct evidence provided in the vulnerability description and the CVE reference, which explicitly mentions the term \"**deadlock**\". The retriever results also support this choice, with CWE-833 being the top-ranked CWE. Other CWEs were considered, but the direct mention of \"**deadlock**\" made CWE-833 the most appropriate choice.
