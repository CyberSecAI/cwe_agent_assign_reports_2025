  "description": "A vulnerability in danswer-ai/danswer v0.3.94 allows an attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) by uploading a file with a malformed multipart boundary. By appending a large number of characters to the end of the multipart boundary, the server continuously processes each character, rendering the application inaccessible. This issue can be exploited by sending a single crafted request, affecting all users on the server.",

This is directly related to the vulnerability description, where the server continuously processes characters due to a malformed multipart boundary, leading to a denial of service.\n\nCWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) is a parent of CWE-770, but CWE-770 is more specific and better captures the root cause of the vulnerability.\n\nCWE-789 (Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value) is a child of CWE-770 and a peer of CWE-1325, which deals with improperly controlled sequential memory allocation. However, the description emphasizes the lack of limits or throttling rather than excessive size values, making CWE-770 a better fit.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe789[\"CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\"]\n    cwe1325[\"CWE-1325: Improperly Controlled Sequential Memory Allocation\"]\n\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    cwe789 -->|CHILDOF| cwe770\n    cwe1325 -->|CHILDOF| cwe770\n    cwe789 --|PEEROF| cwe1325\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe770 primary\n    class cwe400,cwe789,cwe1325 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **malformed multipart boundary** in the uploaded file. Due to the **lack of limits or throttling** (CWE-770), the server continuously processes the boundary, leading to **denial of service (DoS)**. The root cause is the missing restriction on the amount of resources allocated to processing the uploaded file.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis focuses on the root cause of the denial-of-service vulnerability. The vulnerability description clearly states that the server continuously processes characters because of a malformed multipart boundary, leading to a DoS. The key phrase here is the continuous processing due to the malformed input, which indicates a **lack of limits or throttling** on resource allocation.\n\nThe retriever results listed CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) as the top combined result. The description of CWE-770 aligns perfectly with the vulnerability: \"The product allocates a reusable resource or group of resources on behalf of an actor without imposing any restrictions on the size or number of resources that can be allocated, in violation of the intended security policy for that actor.\"\n\nOther CWEs were considered but deemed less appropriate. For instance, CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) is a broader category, while CWE-789 (Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value) is more specific to memory allocation, which is not the primary issue here. The core issue is the absence of limits on processing the input, not necessarily the amount of memory allocated.\n\nThe decision to select CWE-770 is based on the evidence in the vulnerability description and the matching description in the CWE specifications. The abstraction level of Base is also preferred as it is a more precise representation of the weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**:
