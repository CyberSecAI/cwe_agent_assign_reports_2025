## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability in the combination of the OpenBMCs FW1050.00 through FW1050.10, FW1030.00 through FW1030.50, and FW1020.00 through FW1020.60 **default password** and session management allow an attacker to gain administrative access to the BMC. IBM X-Force ID 290674.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **default password**
- **weakness:** **default password and session management**
- **impact:** gain administrative access to the BMC
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** OpenBMCs
- **version:** FW1050.00 through FW1050.10 and FW1030.00 through FW1030.50 and and FW1020.00 through FW1020.60

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The BMC (Baseboard Management Controller) is vulnerable during the time it is connected to the network and does not yet have its "admin" account password set.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The primary vulnerability is the existence of a default "admin" account without a pre-set password in the BMC firmware.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can potentially gain unauthorized access to the BMC.
- **Attack vectors:**  The vulnerability is exploitable when the BMC is connected to a network and the default "admin" account password has not been changed. This likely allows a remote attacker to access the BMC.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have network access to the BMC during the period when it is connected to a network but before its admin password is changed.
