# Raw Analyzer Response for CVE-2025-4894

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-326 | Inadequate Encryption Strength | 1.0 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Primary CWE. The vulnerability description explicitly states **"inadequate encryption strength"**. |
| CWE-327 | Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm | 0.7 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary Candidate. Could be related if the **inadequate encryption strength** stems from a broken or risky algorithm. |
| CWE-1391 | Use of Weak Credentials | 0.6 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary Candidate. If the **inadequate encryption strength** is due to weak credentials being used. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
- The primary CWE is CWE-326, which is a Class-level CWE.
- CWE-327 is a peer Class-level CWE that represents a related but distinct weakness. It's about using a broken algorithm, whereas CWE-326 is about using an algorithm that isn't strong enough. If the inadequate strength stems from the choice of a weak algorithm, then CWE-327 might apply.
- CWE-1391 is a Class-level CWE that describes the use of weak credentials. This could potentially lead to **inadequate encryption strength**.

## Vulnerability Chain
The chain starts with the **inadequate encryption strength** (CWE-326) in the `gen_rsa_keys` function. This could be due to a broken or risky algorithm (CWE-327) or the use of weak credentials (CWE-1391). The impact is that the encryption is not strong enough, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data.

## Summary of Analysis
The vulnerability description explicitly mentions **"inadequate encryption strength"**, making CWE-326 the most appropriate primary CWE. The retriever results also list CWE-326 as a potential candidate. The choice is based on the explicit mention of the weakness in the description. CWE-327 and CWE-1391 were considered as possible contributing factors, but without further information, they are classified as secondary candidate CWEs.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-1286: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input that is expected to be well-formed - i.e., to comply with a certain syntax - but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input complies with the syntax.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores or transmits sensitive data using an encryption scheme that is theoretically sound, but is not strong enough for the level of protection required.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-294: Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A capture-replay flaw exists when the design of the product makes it possible for a malicious user to sniff network traffic and bypass authentication by replaying it to the server in question to the same effect as the original message (or with minor changes).

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense
