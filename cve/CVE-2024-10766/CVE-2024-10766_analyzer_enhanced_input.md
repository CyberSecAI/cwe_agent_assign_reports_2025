## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-10766 (based on the content, the provided CVE description is just a placeholder, so the analysis is based on the information present in the content)

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the direct usage of the `$_FILES` input in the `/pages/save_user.php` file to determine the storage location of uploaded files, without any input validation or sanitization. Specifically, the code snippet is vulnerable in line 19 of the file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Missing Input Sanitization:** The file path and filename are not sanitized or validated before being used to store the uploaded file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **File Overwrite:** Attackers can overwrite existing files on the server.
- **File Injection:** Malicious files, such as PHP scripts, can be uploaded and potentially executed.
- **Directory Traversal:** The lack of sanitization can lead to directory traversal attacks, where an attacker can upload files outside the intended directory.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Uploading large or malicious files could cause a denial of service.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading and executing malicious code, an attacker can achieve remote code execution on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through the web interface by uploading files to `/pages/save_user.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to access the web interface and initiate file upload requests. No special privileges or access is mentioned, indicating a standard user role may be sufficient.

**Additional Notes**
- The provided images within the content are just proof of concept (POC) screenshots and code execution. They don't provide additional vulnerability details, but illustrate the ease of exploitation.
