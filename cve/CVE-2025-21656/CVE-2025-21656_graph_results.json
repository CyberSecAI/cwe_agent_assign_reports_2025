  "query": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved hwmon (drivetemp) Fix driver producing garbage data when SCSI errors occur scsi_execute_cmd() function can return both negative (linux codes) and positive (scsi_cmnd result field) error codes. Currently the driver just passes error codes of scsi_execute_cmd() to hwmon core, which is incorrect because hwmon only checks for negative error codes. This leads to hwmon reporting uninitialized data to userspace in case of SCSI errors (for example if the disk drive was disconnected). This patch checks scsi_execute_cmd() output and returns -EIO if its error code is positive. [groeck Avoid inline variable declaration for portability]",
