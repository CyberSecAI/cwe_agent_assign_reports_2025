  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved hwmon (drivetemp) Fix driver producing garbage data when SCSI errors occur scsi_execute_cmd() function can return both negative (linux codes) and positive (scsi_cmnd result field) error codes. Currently the driver just passes error codes of scsi_execute_cmd() to hwmon core, which is incorrect because **hwmon only checks for negative error codes**. This leads to hwmon reporting uninitialized data to userspace in case of SCSI errors (for example if the disk drive was disconnected). This patch checks scsi_execute_cmd() output and returns -EIO if its error code is positive. [groeck Avoid inline variable declaration for portability]",

The code's failure to properly interpret the return value of `scsi_execute_cmd()` leads to the use of uninitialized data, which then is exposed to the user.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe394[\"CWE-394: Unexpected Status Code or Return Value\"]\n    cwe908[\"CWE-908: Use of Uninitialized Resource\"]\n    \n    cwe908 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe394\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe394 primary\n    class cwe908 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the `scsi_execute_cmd()` function returning both negative and positive error codes. The **hwmon component only checks for negative error codes**, leading to an unexpected status code/return value, resulting in the use of uninitialized data being reported to userspace.\n  - Root Cause: The **hwmon only checks for negative error codes**.\n  - Weakness: Unexpected Status Code or Return Value (CWE-394)\n  - Impact: Use of Uninitialized Resource (CWE-908)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-394 as the primary weakness because the **root cause** is that the code **only checks for negative error codes** from `scsi_execute_cmd()`. The retriever results also list CWE-394 as the top candidate. This leads to the hwmon module using an unexpected status code, causing it to report uninitialized data. The graph relationships show how this leads to the use of uninitialized resources (CWE-908).\n\nThe selection of CWE-394 and CWE-908 is based on the evidence from the vulnerability description, specifically the **root cause** that the **hwmon only checks for negative error codes** of the `scsi_execute_cmd()` return value and the subsequent reporting of uninitialized data to userspace.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-193: Off-by-one Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product calculates or uses an incorrect maximum or minimum value that is 1 more, or 1 less, than the correct value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-908: Use of Uninitialized Resource\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses or accesses a resource that has not been initialized.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
