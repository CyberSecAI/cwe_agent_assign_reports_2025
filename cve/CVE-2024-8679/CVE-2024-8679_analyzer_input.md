# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-8679

## Vulnerability Description
The Library Management System Manage e-Digital Books Library plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the value parameter of the owt_lib_handler AJAX action in all versions up to, and including, 3.0.0 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**
- **weakness:** **SQL injection**
- **impact:** extract sensitive information from the database and information disclosure
- **attacker:** authenticated attackers
- **product:** Library Management System Manage e-Digital Books Library plugin for WordPress
- **version:** all versions up to and including 3.0.0
- **component:** owt_lib_handler AJAX action

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**1. Verification:**
The content from wordfence.com and the provided code snippet from plugins.trac.wordpress.org relate to CVE-2024-8679. Both sources describe an SQL injection vulnerability in the "Library Management System" WordPress plugin, version 3.0.0 and below.

**2. Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and lack of proper preparation in SQL queries, specifically in the `owt_lib_handler` AJAX action. The 'value' parameter is not sanitized, which allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the susceptibility to SQL injection attacks. The plugin fails to properly escape user-supplied input when constructing SQL queries.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to the extraction of sensitive data from the WordPress database. The provided writeup specifically mentions extraction of sensitive information as a possible outcome of exploitation.
- **Potential Data Manipulation:** While not explicitly stated, the SQL injection could potentially be leveraged to modify data within the database or gain unauthorized access to other parts of the system depending on the database user's privileges.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack is conducted over the network, likely via HTTP requests to the WordPress site's AJAX endpoint.
- **AJAX action:**  The `owt_lib_handler` AJAX action is the specific entry point for the attack. The 'value' parameter within the request is where the malicious SQL payload is injected.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** Attackers must be authenticated users with "Administrator-level access and above" to exploit this vulnerability. This access is necessary to trigger the vulnerable AJAX action.
- **Technical Knowledge:**  Attackers require knowledge of SQL syntax and how to craft malicious SQL queries for injection purposes.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Eduardo Bido.
- There is no known patch available for this vulnerability. The recommendation is to uninstall the plugin.
- The Wordfence article provides a CVSS score of 6.8 (Medium).
- The provided code excerpt from `plugins.trac.wordpress.org` includes the core plugin file, and while it doesn't pinpoint the exact vulnerable code, it validates the affected software. The file contains many SQL queries, where any could be susceptible.
