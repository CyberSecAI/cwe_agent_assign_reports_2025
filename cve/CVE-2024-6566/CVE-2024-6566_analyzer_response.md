# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-548 | Information Exposure Through Directory Listing | 0.8 | Base | Primary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE selected, CWE-548 [Information Exposure Through Directory Listing], is a specific type of information exposure. CWE-200 [Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor] is a broader category that encompasses CWE-548. CWE-425 [Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')] relates to the method of accessing the file, but the core issue is the information exposure itself. Therefore, I chose the most specific CWE (CWE-548) as the primary and included the others as secondary candidates.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain begins with a **missing access control** on the `composer-setup.php` file, leading to **direct access** via a URL (CWE-425). The `composer-setup.php` file has `display_errors` enabled, which causes the full file path to be displayed, resulting in **information exposure** (CWE-548). This **information exposure** can then aid further attacks.

## Summary of Analysis
My analysis is based primarily on the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which states the root cause is the lack of access control on the `composer-setup.php` file, and the file outputs errors with `display_errors` enabled, revealing the full path of the web application. I have chosen CWE-548 [Information Exposure Through Directory Listing] as the primary CWE because it most accurately describes the specific vulnerability: the exposure of the full path of the web application due to a file being directly accessible and displaying errors. While CWE-200 [Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor] is also relevant, it is a broader category. CWE-425 [Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')] is relevant because the file is being accessed directly without authorization, but this is the means of access, not the core weakness. The relationship graph helped to clarify that CWE-548 is a specific type of CWE-200.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
**Abstraction Level**: Compound
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.



## CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently ensuring that the resulting data will be valid.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output
