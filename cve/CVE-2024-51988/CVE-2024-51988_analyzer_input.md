# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-51988

## Vulnerability Description
RabbitMQ is a feature rich, multi-protocol messaging and streaming broker. In affected versions queue deletion via the HTTP API was not verifying the `configure` permission of the user. Users who had all of the following 1. Valid credentials, 2. Some permissions for the target virtual host & 3. HTTP API access. could delete queues it had no (deletion) permissions for. This issue has been addressed in version 3.12.11 of the open source rabbitMQ release and in versions 1.5.2, 3.13.0, and 4.0.0 of the tanzu release. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may disable management plugin and use, for example, Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** delete queues it had no (deletion) permissions for
- **vector:** queue deletion via the HTTP API
- **attacker:** users with valid credentials, some permissions for the target virtual host & HTTP API access
- **product:** RabbitMQ
- **version:** before 3.12.11, before 1.5.2, before 3.13.0, before 4.0.0

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-51988:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of this vulnerability is that the RabbitMQ HTTP API endpoint for queue deletion did not properly verify if the user had the necessary `configure` permission.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Broken Access Control (CWE-284):** The system fails to enforce proper authorization checks before allowing a user to delete a queue via the HTTP API. This allows users with insufficient permissions to perform actions they should not be able to.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A user with valid credentials, some permissions on a vhost, and access to the HTTP API, could delete queues within the vhost even without the required `configure` permission for those specific queues. This can lead to:
    - Data loss (messages in the queue are deleted).
    - Service disruption, as applications may depend on these queues.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is **Network**. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability through network access to the RabbitMQ HTTP API.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the following:
    1. Valid credentials for RabbitMQ.
    2. Some form of permission on the target virtual host.
    3. Network access to the RabbitMQ HTTP API.
- The attacker does not require any user interaction to perform the attack.
- The attacker requires low privileges to perform the attack.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in RabbitMQ versions prior to 3.12.11, and Tanzu RabbitMQ versions prior to 1.5.2 and 3.13.0
- Patched versions include RabbitMQ 3.12.11, and Tanzu RabbitMQ 1.5.2, 3.13.0, and 4.0.0
- A workaround is to disable the management plugin and rely on monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* 🔍 *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* 🔍 *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion – CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### 🔸 CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ✅ *“A user created with the ‘guest’ role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ✅ *“The backup service runs as root but only needs read access.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ⚠️ This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### 🔸 CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ✅ *“User can access another user’s invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.”*

## Mapping Examples – Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *“User can escalate privileges to admin.”*
> ❌ Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged – only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ✅ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**

| “Unauthorized read/write to file”           | Permission control issue              | CWE-285                                      |
| “Can access resource without correct role”  | Incorrect or missing permission check | CWE-285, 862, 863                            |

## Good Mapping Examples – Privileges & Permissions

* ✅ **CWE-266**: *“When a new user registers, the system assigns them admin role due to a missing role validation.”*
* ✅ **CWE-250**: *“Installer runs with system-level privileges but doesn't require them to install files in the user directory.”*
* ✅ **CWE-284**: *“Inconsistent access rules between UI and backend for sensitive endpoints.”*
* ✅ **CWE-285**: *“Authorization logic fails to restrict access to finance reports based on department.”*
