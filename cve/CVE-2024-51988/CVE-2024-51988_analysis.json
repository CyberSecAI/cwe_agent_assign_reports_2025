  "description": "RabbitMQ is a feature rich, multi-protocol messaging and streaming broker. In affected versions queue deletion via the HTTP API was not verifying the `configure` permission of the user. Users who had all of the following 1. Valid credentials, 2. Some permissions for the target virtual host & 3. HTTP API access. could delete queues it had no (deletion) permissions for. This issue has been addressed in version 3.12.11 of the open source rabbitMQ release and in versions 1.5.2, 3.13.0, and 4.0.0 of the tanzu release. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may disable management plugin and use, for example, Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-51988:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nThe root cause of this vulnerability is that the RabbitMQ HTTP API endpoint for queue deletion did not properly verify if the user had the necessary `configure` permission.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Broken Access Control (CWE-284):** The system fails to enforce proper authorization checks before allowing a user to delete a queue via the HTTP API. This allows users with insufficient permissions to perform actions they should not be able to.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- A user with valid credentials, some permissions on a vhost, and access to the HTTP API, could delete queues within the vhost even without the required `configure` permission for those specific queues. This can lead to:\n    - Data loss (messages in the queue are deleted).\n    - Service disruption, as applications may depend on these queues.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- The attack vector is **Network**. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability through network access to the RabbitMQ HTTP API.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- The attacker needs the following:\n    1. Valid credentials for RabbitMQ.\n    2. Some form of permission on the target virtual host.\n    3. Network access to the RabbitMQ HTTP API.\n- The attacker does not require any user interaction to perform the attack.\n- The attacker requires low privileges to perform the attack.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The vulnerability is present in RabbitMQ versions prior to 3.12.11, and Tanzu RabbitMQ versions prior to 1.5.2 and 3.13.0\n- Patched versions include RabbitMQ 3.12.11, and Tanzu RabbitMQ 1.5.2, 3.13.0, and 4.0.0\n- A workaround is to disable the management plugin and rely on monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana.",

Given the vulnerability description states that the queue deletion via the HTTP API was not verifying the `configure` permission of the user, I determined that the authorization was present but flawed, making CWE-863 more appropriate than CWE-862 as the primary CWE. Both CWE-862 and CWE-863 are children of the more general CWE-285 (Improper Authorization), but selecting them provides a more specific characterization of the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe862 secondary\n    class cwe285 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with a **missing or incorrect permission check** on the queue deletion HTTP API endpoint, leading to the **ability to delete queues without proper permissions**, culminating in potential **data loss** and **service disruption**.\n  - The root cause is the **incorrect authorization** check.\n  - The impact is unauthorized queue deletion and subsequent service disruption.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nMy analysis is based on the provided evidence, particularly the vulnerability description and CVE reference summary. The description clearly states that the queue deletion via the HTTP API was **not verifying** the `configure` permission of the user, suggesting that some authorization logic was present but **incorrectly implemented**. The **incorrect authorization** is the root cause that led to the vulnerability.\n\nI considered both **Missing Authorization** (CWE-862) and **Incorrect Authorization** (CWE-863). CWE-863 is more appropriate because the authorization check was present but flawed. If the authorization check was completely absent, CWE-862 would have been a better fit. Both of these are preferred to the general case CWE-285.\n\nThe selection of CWE-863 is at the optimal level of specificity because it accurately captures the **incorrect authorization** aspect of the vulnerability. It is a Class-level CWE, which is appropriate given the available information. While a more specific Base-level CWE might exist under CWE-863, there is not enough information to make this determination.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 2055.32\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-862: Missing Authorization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 1880.59\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-285: Improper Authorization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 1981.83\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-285 is high-level and lower-level CWEs can frequently be used instead.
