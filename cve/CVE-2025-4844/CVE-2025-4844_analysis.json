CWE-120 is a more specific case of CWE-119. The vulnerability description clearly states \"**buffer overflow**\" caused by manipulating the CD Command Handler. Since CWE-120 explicitly describes a buffer copy without checking size, it is a more precise match than the broader CWE-119.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe120[\"CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    \n    cwe120 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe120 primary\n    class cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper** handling within the CD Command Handler, leading to a **buffer overflow** due to unchecked input size during a buffer copy operation.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The description clearly points to a \"**buffer overflow**\" when manipulating the CD Command Handler in FreeFloat FTP Server 1.0. The Retriever Results also highlighted CWE-119, CWE-190 and CWE-120 as potential candidates. However, given the specific mention of a **buffer overflow** stemming from a copy operation, CWE-120 was deemed the most appropriate primary CWE. CWE-119 is a broader category, but the specific details align better with CWE-120. While the evidence is limited, the clear mention of \"**buffer overflow**\" strongly supports this classification.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were

assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than\n         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is\n         incremented to a value that is too large to store in the\n         associated representation. When this occurs, the value may\n         become a very small or negative number.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 563.38\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 530.70\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nA heap overflow condition is a buffer overflow, where the buffer that can be overwritten is allocated in the heap portion of memory, generally meaning that the buffer was allocated using a routine such as malloc().\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1",
