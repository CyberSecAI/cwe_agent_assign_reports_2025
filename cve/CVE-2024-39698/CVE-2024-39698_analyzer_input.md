# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-39698

## Vulnerability Description
electron-updater allows for automatic updates for Electron apps. The file `packages/electron-updater/src/windowsExecutableCodeSignatureVerifier.ts` implements the signature validation routine for Electron applications on Windows. Because of the surrounding shell, a first pass by `cmd.exe` expands any environment variable found in command-line above. This creates a situation where `verifySignature()` can be tricked into validating the certificate of a different file than the one that was just downloaded. If the step is successful, the malicious update will be executed even if its signature is invalid. This attack assumes a compromised update manifest (server compromise, Man-in-the-Middle attack if fetched over HTTP, **Cross-Site Scripting** to point the application to a malicious updater server, etc.). The patch is available starting from 6.3.0-alpha.6.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **improper certificate validation**
- **weakness:** **Cross-Site Scripting**
- **impact:** execute malicious update with invalid signature
- **vector:** compromised update manifest and Man-in-the-Middle attack and Cross-Site Scripting
- **product:** electron-updater
- **version:** before 6.3.0-alpha.6

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-39698:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how `electron-updater` on Windows verifies the code signature of update files. Specifically, the `verifySignature` function in `windowsExecutableCodeSignatureVerifier.ts` executes a PowerShell command within a `cmd.exe` shell. This makes the command vulnerable to environment variable expansion prior to being passed to PowerShell. An attacker could inject environment variables into the file path, causing the command to verify the signature of an attacker-controlled file rather than the intended update file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The primary weakness is the vulnerability to command injection through environment variable expansion within the command string executed by `cmd.exe`. The `tempUpdateFile` parameter, meant to hold the path to the downloaded update file, could be manipulated to point to a different file or execute arbitrary commands.
*   **Inadequate Path Validation:** The initial implementation did not verify the `LiteralPath` of the update file returned by the `Get-AuthenticodeSignature` cmdlet against the intended path of the downloaded file. It only validated the signer certificate.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Code Signing Bypass:** An attacker can bypass code signing verification by manipulating the file path used in the PowerShell command.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation would allow an attacker to replace a legitimate update file with a malicious one. When the update is applied, it could lead to arbitrary code execution on the user's machine.
*   **Compromised Application:** If a malicious update is installed, the application may be fully compromised.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Compromised Update Manifest:** The attacker needs to compromise the update manifest or server to redirect the application to download a malicious update.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle Attack:** If the update manifest is fetched over HTTP, a MITM attack can redirect the application to a malicious update server.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** An XSS vulnerability could be leveraged to modify the update URL, pointing to a malicious updater server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Compromised Update Infrastructure:** The attacker must gain control over the update manifest or server that serves the update information.
*   **Network Interception:** The attacker may need to intercept network traffic if the update manifest is fetched over HTTP.
*   **Ability to Craft Malicious Update:**  The attacker would need to create a malicious file that they want to be executed on the victim's machine. They would need to host it on a malicious server.

**Patch Information**
*   The vulnerability was addressed in pull request [#8295](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/pull/8295).
*   The fix ensures that the `LiteralPath` returned by `Get-AuthenticodeSignature` matches the original path.
*   The fix was released in `electron-updater` version 6.3.0-alpha.6 and later.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix includes additional logging to help detect similar issues.
*   The `changeset` package was used to manage the versioning and release of the patch.
*   The fix is in `packages/electron-updater/src/windowsExecutableCodeSignatureVerifier.ts`, which now includes a check to ensure the LiteralPath returned by the PowerShell command is what it should be.
