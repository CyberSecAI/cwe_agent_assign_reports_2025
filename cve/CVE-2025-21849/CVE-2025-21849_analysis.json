  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drm/i915/gt Use spin_lock_irqsave() in interruptible context spin_lock/unlock() functions used in interrupt contexts could result in a **deadlock**, as seen in GitLab issue #13399, which occurs when interrupt comes in while holding a lock. Try to remedy the problem by saving irq state before spin lock acquisition. v2 add irqs state save/restore calls to all locks/unlocks in signal_irq_work() execution (Maciej) v3 use with spin_lock_irqsave() in guc_lrc_desc_unpin() instead of other lock/unlock calls and add Fixes and Cc tags (Tvrtko) change title and commit message (cherry picked from commit c088387ddd6482b40f21ccf23db1125e8fa4af7e)",

Since the vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"**deadlock**\", the more specific CWE-833 is selected as the primary CWE, while CWE-667 is considered as a secondary candidate.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe833[\"CWE-833: Deadlock\"]\n    cwe667[\"CWE-667: Improper Locking\"]\n    \n    cwe833 -->|CHILDOF| cwe667\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe833 primary\n    class cwe667 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **deadlock** itself, which is caused by improper locking mechanisms in interruptible contexts within the Linux kernel. The initial **rootcause** is the potential for a **deadlock** when an interrupt occurs while a lock is held. This leads to a system halt or unresponsiveness.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-833 as the primary candidate due to the explicit mention of \"**deadlock**\" in the vulnerability description. The retriever results also listed CWE-833 as a top candidate. Further analysis confirmed that CWE-833 is a more specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability compared to its parent class, CWE-667. The decision is heavily based on the direct evidence of the \"**deadlock**\" condition. The relationships show that CWE-833 is a child of CWE-667, indicating that the improper locking leads to the **deadlock** condition.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-833: Deadlock\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains multiple threads or executable segments that are waiting for each other to release a necessary lock, resulting in **deadlock**.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check.
