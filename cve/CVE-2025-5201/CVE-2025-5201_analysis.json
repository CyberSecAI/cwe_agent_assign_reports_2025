  "description": "A vulnerability was found in Open Asset Import Library Assimp 5.4.3. It has been classified as problematic. Affected is the function LWOImporterCountVertsAndFacesLWO2 of the file assimp/code/AssetLib/LWO/LWOLoader.cpp. The manipulation leads to **out-of-bounds read**. The attack needs to be approached locally. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The project decided to collect all Fuzzer bugs in a main-issue to address them in the future.",

  "reference_content": "CVE-2025-5201: PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval\n\nThe provided content relates to vulnerabilities discovered in the assimp library through fuzzing and sanitization. Here's a breakdown of the relevant information extracted from the three GitHub issue reports:\n\n**1. Issue #6174: Heap OOB read in `HL1MDLLoader::validate_header`**\n\n*   **Root cause:** The code doesn't check the file size before accessing the buffer/header.\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Heap buffer overflow.\n*   **Impact of exploitation:**  Potential for arbitrary code execution or denial of service.\n*   **Attack vectors:** Providing a crafted MDL file.\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Ability to create and provide a malicious MDL file.\n*   **Mitigation or fix:** Implement file size validation before accessing the buffer/header.\n\n**2. Issue #6128: Epic to track fuzzer/sanitizer bugs**\n\n*   This is a meta-issue tracking multiple bugs found by fuzzing and sanitizers. It doesn't detail a specific vulnerability but provides context for the other issues.\n\n**3. Issue #6173: Heap OOB reads in `LWOImporter::CountVertsAndFacesLWO2`**\n\n*   **Root cause:** The code assumes the end pointer is 2-byte aligned, which isn't always true.  Also, `numIndices` is not checked to ensure it fits within the buffer.\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Heap buffer overflow, potential for out-of-bounds read.\n*   **Impact of exploitation:** Potential for arbitrary code execution or denial of service.\n*   **Attack vectors:** Providing a crafted LWO file.\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Ability to create and provide a malicious LWO file.\n*   **Mitigation or fix:** Ensure the end pointer is correctly aligned and validate `numIndices` against the buffer size.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n*   All three issues were identified through fuzzing and confirmed with AddressSanitizer (ASAN).\n*   Reproducers (sample files) are provided for issues #6174 and #6173, allowing for easy reproduction of the crashes.\n*   The issues are related to parsing MDL and LWO file formats.\n*   The content provides more detail than a typical CVE description, including ASAN output and reproduction steps.",
