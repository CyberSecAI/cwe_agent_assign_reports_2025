# Enhanced Analysis for CVE-2025-24146

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-212 | Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer | 0.8 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-209 | Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information | 0.6 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE selected is CWE-212, which focuses on the improper handling of sensitive information before storage or transfer. While CWE-209 is a potential secondary issue, it is less directly related to the root cause but rather a potential symptom. CWE-212 is at the Base level, providing a specific description of the weakness. There aren't any direct parent-child relationships significantly impacting this decision, but understanding the base-level weakness is important for precise classification.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the deletion of a conversation in Messages, which leads to the **improper redaction of sensitive information** (CWE-212). This then results in the exposure of user contact information in system logging, which might be considered a case of **generation of error message containing sensitive information** (CWE-209) as a secondary effect, if the logs are considered "error messages".

## Summary of Analysis
The primary focus is on CWE-212 because the core issue is the **improper handling and redaction of sensitive information before it's stored in system logs**. The vulnerability description and CVE reference links content summary directly support this classification. The fact that deleting a conversation leads to exposure of contact information due to inadequate redaction aligns perfectly with CWE-212.

CWE-209 is considered as a secondary weakness because the exposure in system logging could be viewed as generating an error message containing sensitive information, but it is the redaction failure that is the more critical flaw.

The retriever results suggested other CWEs such as CWE-787, CWE-843, and CWE-20, but they are not as relevant. There is no mention of out-of-bounds write or type confusion. While **improper input validation** might play a role, the primary weakness lies in how the system handles sensitive data during the deletion process and subsequent logging.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-451: User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The user interface (UI) does not properly represent critical information to the user, allowing the information - or its source - to be obscured or spoofed. This is often a component in phishing attacks.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not verify, or incorrectly verifies, the cryptographic signature for data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-843: Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allocates or initializes a resource such as a pointer, object, or variable using one type, but it later accesses that resource using a type that is incompatible with the original type.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product generates an error message that includes sensitive information about its environment, users, or associated data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-667: Improper Locking
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-843: Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 625.00
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product allocates or initializes a resource such as a pointer, object, or variable using one type, but it later accesses that resource using a type that is incompatible with the original type.
