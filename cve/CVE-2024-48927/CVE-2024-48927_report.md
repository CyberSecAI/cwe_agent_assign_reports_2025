# Analysis Report for CVE-2024-48927

# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-48927

## Description

Umbraco, a free and open source .NET content management system, has a remote code execution issue in versions on the 13.x branch prior to 13.5.2, 10.x prior to 10.8.7, and 8.x prior to 8.18.15. There is a potential risk of code execution for Backoffice users when they preview SVG files in full screen mode. Versions 13.5.2, 10.8,7, and 8.18.15 contain a patch for the issue. As a workaround, derver-side file validation is available to strip script tags from files content during the file upload process.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Impact:** remote code execution
- **Vector:** preview SVG files in full screen mode
- **Attacker:** Backoffice users
- **Product:** Umbraco
- **Version:** 13.x prior to 13.5.2, 10.x prior to 10.8.7, and 8.x prior to 8.18.15

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-1336 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine | 0.75 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE. The vulnerability arises from **lack of proper sanitization of SVG files** when viewed in full-screen mode within the Umbraco backoffice. |
| CWE-79 | Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. Although **Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine** is the better match, the improper neutralization of input during web page generation is also a possible contributing factor. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship influencing the decision is the close match between the vulnerability description and CWE-1336's focus on template engine-related injection. CWE-79 is a related CWE, because the SVG is not neutralized, leading to possible cross-site scripting.

## Vulnerability Chain
The chain of events is as follows:
1.  **Root Cause:** **Insufficient sanitization of SVG content (CWE-1336)** when viewed in full-screen mode.
2.  **Weakness:** This allows potential code execution through malicious SVG files.
3.  **Impact:** Potential remote code execution for backoffice users.

The primary issue is the **lack of proper sanitization**, which leads to the possibility of injecting code via the SVG file.

## Summary of Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-1336 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine) because the vulnerability occurs when SVG files are previewed in full-screen mode. The **root cause** is that there's a **lack of proper sanitization of SVG files** when viewed in full-screen mode within the Umbraco backoffice. This allows for potential code execution.

The CVE Reference Links Content Summary states: "The vulnerability arises from the **lack of proper sanitization of SVG files** when viewed in full-screen mode within the Umbraco backoffice. This allows for potential code execution."

CWE-79 is a plausible secondary CWE because, in essence, the **lack of sanitization** leads to the possibility of injecting malicious scripts that can be executed.

CWE-20 was considered but rejected because it's too general. The specific weakness is the **improper neutralization** of special elements, making CWE-1336 a more precise fit.
