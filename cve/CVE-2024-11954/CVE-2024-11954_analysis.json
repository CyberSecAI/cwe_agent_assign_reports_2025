  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2024-11954 Content\n\nThis content **is relevant** to a vulnerability in PIMCORE, specifically a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. It provides significantly more detail than a standard CVE description.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from the application's failure to properly sanitize content when a user uploads a PDF file. This allows embedded scripts within the PDF to be executed when the file is viewed. The affected code resides in the file handling and rendering logic of the PDF upload feature.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  Specifically, the vulnerability allows for the injection of arbitrary web scripts or HTML via the PDF upload functionality.\n*   **Improper Input Sanitization:** The core issue is the lack of adequate sanitization of PDF content before storage and rendering.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   **Session hijacking:** Malicious scripts can potentially steal user session cookies.\n*   **Web page defacement:** Attackers can modify the content of web pages viewed by users.\n*   **Unauthorized access to sensitive information:**  Scripts can be used to access and steal sensitive data.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   An attacker uploads a malicious PDF file through the PIM Core Upload module.\n*   A user then views the uploaded PDF file.\n*   The embedded script within the PDF is executed in the user's browser.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   The attacker needs to be able to upload files to the PIMCORE system (requires some level of access, likely an authenticated user).\n*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious PDF file containing executable scripts.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   The advisory states that the vulnerability is patched in version **11.5.3**.\n*   The advisory does not detail the specific mitigation steps, but it implies proper input sanitization and output encoding of PDF content are necessary.\n\n**CVSS Score:**\n\n*   CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N\n*   Overall Score: 8.1/10\n\n**Affected versions:**\n\n*   11.4.2\n\n**Patched versions:**\n\n*   11.5.3\n\n**Credits:**\n\n*   @maeitsec (Reporter)",

CWE-434 [Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type] is related because the vulnerability is triggered by uploading a malicious PDF. CWE-116 [Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output] is also related, as proper encoding/escaping could have prevented the XSS.
