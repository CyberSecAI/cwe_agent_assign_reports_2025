  "reference_content": "CVE-2025-1355 - Library-Card-System V 1.0 | Add Picture/Signature - signup.php | Unrestricted File Upload | Found By Maloy Roy Orko\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe application source code allows unrestricted file uploads in the `signup.php` file. There is no file extension or upload protection implemented.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\nUnrestricted File Upload\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n1. Malware Distribution\n2. Remote Code Execution (RCE)\n3. Data Breach\n4. Denial of Service (DoS)\n5. Web Shell Installation\n6. Bypassing Security Controls\n7. Reputation Damage\n\n**Attack vectors:**\nUploading a shell script (e.g., shell.php) via the signature/profile picture upload functionality in `signup.php`.  Accessing the uploaded shell via a URL like `http://192.168.0.100:8080/libb/images/shell.php`.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\nAn attacker needs to be able to access the `signup.php` page and upload a file to it. No specific privileges are required.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\nThe content does not provide specific mitigation steps, but implies implementing file extension and upload protection mechanisms.\n\n**Note:** This content provides more detail than a typical CVE description, including specific examples and a proof-of-concept.",

There are no significant parent-child or chain relationships that strongly influence the classification in this specific case. The abstraction level is already at the Base level, which is preferred.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe434[\"CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    \n    class cwe434 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **unrestricted upload** of a file, leading directly to potential impacts such as malware distribution, remote code execution, data breach, denial of service, web shell installation, bypassing security controls, and reputation damage.\n  - The root cause is the lack of file type restriction.\n  - The impact is potential Remote Code Execution or other malicious activities.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that the application allows **unrestricted file uploads** in the `/signup.php` file. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary further confirms this by stating that \"There is no file extension or upload protection implemented.\" This aligns perfectly with the description of CWE-434, \"Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type,\" which states, \"The product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.\" The evidence is strong and directly supports the selection of CWE-434 as the primary weakness. The other CWEs were not selected because they address different types of vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL Injection, Cross-site Scripting, Missing Authentication). The selection of CWE-434 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it is a Base-level CWE and directly reflects the nature of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-252: Unchecked Return Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not check the return value from a method or function, which can prevent it from detecting unexpected states and conditions.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.
