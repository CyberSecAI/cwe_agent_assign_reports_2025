# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-10548

## Vulnerability Description
The WP Project Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to **Sensitive Information Exposure** in all versions up to, and including, 2.6.15 via the Project Task List (/wp-json/pm/v2/projects/1/task-lists) REST API endpoint. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to extract sensitive data including the hashed passwords of project owners (e.g. adminstrators).

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **Sensitive Information Exposure**
- **impact:** extract sensitive data including hashed passwords
- **vector:** Project Task List REST API endpoint
- **attacker:** authenticated attackers with Subscriber-level access and above
- **product:** WP Project Manager plugin for WordPress
- **version:** all versions up to and including 2.6.15

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-10548

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the WP Project Manager plugin exposing sensitive user data through the `/wp-json/pm/v2/projects/1/task-lists` REST API endpoint. Specifically, the API was returning hashed passwords and other user details of project owners (administrators).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Sensitive Information Exposure:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of sensitive user data, including hashed passwords, user registration details, activation keys, user status, and user capabilities through the REST API endpoint.
- **Insecure API Response:** The REST API response was not properly sanitized and included unnecessary sensitive information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can gain access to sensitive data including hashed passwords of project owners (e.g., administrators).
- **Credential Compromise:** This could lead to the complete compromise of administrator accounts if the hashed passwords are weak and can be cracked or if the user reuses that password on other systems.
- **Further Attacks:** Access to admin accounts could enable attackers to take full control of the WordPress site, install malware, modify content, or steal additional sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **REST API Endpoint:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending requests to the `/wp-json/pm/v2/projects/1/task-lists` REST API endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Access:** Attackers must have at least Subscriber-level access to the WordPress site to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send requests to the vulnerable REST API endpoint.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability affects all versions of the WP Project Manager plugin up to and including version 2.6.15.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.6.16 by sanitizing the API response to remove sensitive user data.
- The provided patch removes the user\_pass, user\_registered, user\_activation\_key, user\_status and allcaps from the creator object returned by the API endpoint.
