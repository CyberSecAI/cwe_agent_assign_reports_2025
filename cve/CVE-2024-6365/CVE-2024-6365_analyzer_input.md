# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-6365

## Vulnerability Description
The Product Table by WBW plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.1 via the saveCustomTitle function. This is due to **missing authorization and lack of sanitization of appended data** in the languages/customTitle.php file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute code on the server.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **attacker:** unauthenticated attackers
- **product:** Product Table by WBW plugin for WordPress
- **version:** all versions up to and including 2.0.1
- **component:** saveCustomTitle function in languages/customTitle.php

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-6365

**Vulnerability Description:**
The vulnerability exists in the "Product Table by WBW" WordPress plugin, specifically in the `saveCustomTitle` function within the `wootablepress.php` file. It's a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability due to insufficient authorization checks and a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied data when appending to the `languages/customTitle.php` file.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is the combination of:
1. **Missing Authorization:** The `saveCustomTitle` function does not properly check if the user is authorized to perform the action before modifying the `customTitle.php` file. Although there's a check for `manage_options` capability, it is circumvented due to the way the data is passed.
2. **Lack of Sanitization:** The plugin uses `sanitize_text_field` to sanitize data, but it's insufficient to prevent code injection because it is used *after* potentially dangerous strings are extracted and included in a file. The extracted data is directly injected into a PHP file using `__('{$value}', 'woo-product-tables');` without proper escaping, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary PHP code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection'):** Specifically, PHP code injection is possible via unsanitized input being written to a `.php` file.
- **Missing Authentication:**  The `saveCustomTitle` function is accessible without proper authentication checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the vulnerable WordPress site. This could lead to:
- Complete compromise of the server.
- Data theft.
- Website defacement.
- Installation of malware or backdoors.
- Denial of Service

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered via the `saveCustomTitle` function of the plugin.
- The attacker sends a malicious request to the WordPress site with crafted data in the `settings` parameter, specifically targeting the `order` parameter and/or the `phrases` parameters such as `empty_table`, `table_info`, etc.
- This malicious data is then processed and used to construct malicious PHP code that is appended to the `customTitle.php` file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated or have any specific privileges on the WordPress site.
- The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable website.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was patched in version 2.0.2 of the plugin.
- The fix involved adding a capability check and sanitization of the values being injected into the `customTitle.php` file.
- The Wordfence article states the vulnerability is present in all versions <= 2.0.1, and it was publicly published on July 8, 2024.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control

**Authentication**:
Determines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.

* Example phrases: "user must log in", "lack of login check", "bypasses login"
* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.

  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* – used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).

**Authorization**:
Determines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do. It decides access *after* identity is verified.

* Example phrases: "unauthorized access", "regular user can access admin panel", "role checks are missing"
* CWE relevance: use CWEs like 862, 863, 285 for authorization errors:

  * **CWE-862**: *Missing Authorization* – the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all.
  * **CWE-863**: *Incorrect Authorization* – the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).
  * **CWE-285**: *Improper Authorization* – general category for any flawed authorization logic or design.

**Access Control**:
A broader term that includes both authentication and authorization. Governs how resources are protected and who can access them under what conditions.

* CWE relevance:

  * **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* – top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear.
  * This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.

## Mapping Discussion – Common Misclassification Patterns

### 1. **CWE-306 vs CWE-862**:

* **306** is about lack of **authentication** (e.g., *no login required at all*).
* **862** is about lack of **authorization** *after* authentication (e.g., *admin check missing*).
* ✅ Example CWE-306: *“An unauthenticated attacker can invoke the password reset API.”*
* ✅ Example CWE-862: *“An authenticated user without admin privileges can delete any user account.”*

### 2. **CWE-285 vs CWE-284**:

* **285** is specific to authorization flaws – it's a better choice than 284 **if** the issue involves *improper or missing role checks*.
* **284** should be reserved for general access control issues when it’s unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.

---

## Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification

**Phrase like "unauthorized access" is not enough.**

* If you **cannot determine whether identity was checked**, assume it’s **authorization** and consider 862 or 863.
* If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** → CWE-306.
* If the **access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced**, but it's not due to missing checks, consider **CWE-284**.

---

## Good Mapping Examples

* ✅ **CWE-306**: “The endpoint `/admin/deleteUser` does not require any authentication.”
* ✅ **CWE-862**: “Any logged-in user can change any other user's email without being an admin.”
* ✅ **CWE-863**: “An admin check exists but incorrectly grants access to non-admin users.”
* ✅ **CWE-285**: “Application uses a static role check that fails when roles change dynamically.”
* ✅ **CWE-284**: “Inconsistent enforcement of access rules across services with unclear policy source.”
