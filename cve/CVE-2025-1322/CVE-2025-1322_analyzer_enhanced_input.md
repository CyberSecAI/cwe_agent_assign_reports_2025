## Vulnerability Description
The WP-Recall Registration, Profile, Commerce & More plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 16.26.10 via the feed shortcode due to **insufficient restrictions on which posts can be included**. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to view data from password protected, private, or draft posts that they should not have access to.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **insufficient restrictions on which posts can be included**
- **impact:** Information Exposure
- **vector:** feed shortcode
- **attacker:** unauthenticated attackers
- **product:** WP-Recall Registration, Profile, Commerce & More plugin for WordPress
- **version:** all versions up to and including 16.26.10
- **component:** feed shortcode

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The CVE description is missing, so I cannot verify if the content relates to it. However, I can extract vulnerability information from the provided content.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The code previously did not escape user-supplied data (`$post->user_write` and `$post->update_activity`) before using it in SQL queries. This could lead to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection

**Impact of exploitation:**
Potential for unauthorized database access, modification, or deletion.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker could manipulate the `$post->user_write` or `$post->update_activity` values to inject malicious SQL code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to control the `$post->user_write` and `$post->update_activity` values. This likely requires some level of access or the ability to influence the data being processed by the application.

**Mitigation or fix:**
The changeset introduces `esc_sql()` to sanitize the `$post->user_write` and `$post->update_activity` values before they are used in the SQL query. This prevents SQL injection by escaping potentially malicious characters.

**Note:** This content provides more detail than a typical CVE description, as it shows the specific code changes made to address the vulnerability.
