The description says: "A **request smuggling** vulnerability existed in the Google Cloud Classic Application Load Balancer due to **improper handling of chunked-encoded HTTP requests**."

The Retriever Results also lists CWE-444 as the top candidate.

CWE-444 is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level.

CWE-20 "Improper Input Validation" was considered but rejected. The description is more specific than just general input validation issues.

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-444: Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request/Response Smuggling')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product acts as an intermediary HTTP agent
         (such as a proxy or firewall) in the data flow between two
         entities such as a client and server, but it does not
         interpret malformed HTTP requests or responses in ways that
         are consistent with how the messages will be processed by
         those entities that are at the ultimate destination.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
