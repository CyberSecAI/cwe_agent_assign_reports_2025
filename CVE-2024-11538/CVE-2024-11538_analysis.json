  "description": "IrfanView DXF File Parsing Memory Corruption Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of IrfanView. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of DXF files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a **memory corruption** condition. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-24629.",

This can lead to a memory corruption condition.\n- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory corruption due to insufficient validation of user-provided data.\n- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process. This means the attacker gains control over the application with the same privileges as the user running IrfanView.\n- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is a malicious DXF file. An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by tricking a user into visiting a malicious page or opening a malicious DXF file with IrfanView.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to craft a malicious DXF file and then convince a user to open it with the vulnerable IrfanView application. User interaction is required to initiate the exploitation.",

CWE-787 is a more specific type of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), which in turn can be caused by CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation).

The \"CWE for similar CVE Descriptions\" section also lists CWE-787 as the primary CWE match. The retriever results confirm that CWE-787 is the most relevant CWE. The relationship analysis shows how CWE-20 can lead to CWE-787.\n\nThe selection of CWE-787 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly describes the memory corruption issue resulting from writing data outside the intended buffer. While CWE-20 contributes to the vulnerability, CWE-787 more precisely identifies the technical flaw.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-129: Improper Validation of Array Index\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses untrusted input when calculating or using an array index, but the product does not validate or incorrectly validates the index to ensure the index references a valid position within the array.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.67\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.67\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary.
