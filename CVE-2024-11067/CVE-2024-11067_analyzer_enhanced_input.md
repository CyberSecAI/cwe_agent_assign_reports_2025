## Vulnerability Description
The D-Link DSL6740C modem has a **Path Traversal Vulnerability**, allowing unauthenticated remote attackers to exploit this vulnerability to read arbitrary system files. Additionally, since the devices **default password** is a combination of the MAC address, attackers can obtain the MAC address through this vulnerability and attempt to log in to the device using the **default password**.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **default password**
- **weakness:** **Path Traversal Vulnerability**
- **impact:** read arbitrary system files
- **attacker:** unauthenticated remote attackers
- **product:** D-Link DSL6740C
