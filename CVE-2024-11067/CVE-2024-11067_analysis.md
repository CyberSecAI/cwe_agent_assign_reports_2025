# Analysis for CVE-2024-11067

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-22 | Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE.  The vulnerability description explicitly states a path traversal vulnerability exists. |
| CWE-1392 | Use of Default Credentials | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The vulnerability description mentions the device uses a **default password**, derived from the MAC address. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is a **Path Traversal Vulnerability** (CWE-22), which allows reading arbitrary system files. A secondary issue is the use of a **default password** (CWE-1392), which can be combined with the exposed MAC address to gain unauthorized access.
CWE-22 is a Base level CWE, which is preferred. CWE-1392 is also a Base level CWE.

## Vulnerability Chain
1.  **Path Traversal (CWE-22):** The application fails to properly restrict pathnames, allowing access to arbitrary files.
2.  **Information Disclosure:** Attackers read the MAC address from a system file.
3.  **Use of Default Credentials (CWE-1392):** The device uses a default password based on the MAC address.
4.  **Authentication Bypass:** Attackers use the MAC address and default password to log in to the device.

## Summary of Analysis
The primary vulnerability is CWE-22, based on the explicit description of a path traversal issue. The secondary vulnerability is CWE-1392, due to the use of a **default password**.

The evidence for CWE-22 is strong: "The D-Link DSL6740C modem has a **Path Traversal Vulnerability**, allowing unauthenticated remote attackers to exploit this vulnerability to read arbitrary system files."

The evidence for CWE-1392 is also present: "Additionally, since the devices **default password** is a combination of the MAC address, attackers can obtain the MAC address through this vulnerability and attempt to log in to the device using the **default password**."

Both CWEs are at the Base level of abstraction.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense
