Due to **Input Validation**, **Premature Release of Resource During Expected Lifetime**, **and Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime bugs**, Squid is vulnerable to Denial of Service attacks by a trusted server against all clients using the proxy. This bug is fixed in the default build configuration of Squid version 6.10.', key_phrases={'rootcause': ['Input Validation', 'Premature Release of Resource During Expected Lifetime', 'and Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime bugs'], 'weakness': '', 'impact': 'Denial of Service attacks', 'vector': '', 'attacker': 'trusted server', 'product': 'Squid', 'version': '6.10', 'component': ''}, reference_content=\"Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-45802:\\n\\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\\n\\n*   The vulnerability stems from multiple issues in Squid's handling of Edge Side Includes (ESI) responses, specifically within the processing of `<esi:when>`, `<esi:assign>`, `<esi:include>`, `<esi:try>`, and `<esi:choose>` tags, as well as error handling and processing overlong headers. These issues are due to:\\n    *   Input Validation failures.\\n    *   Premature Release of Resources during Expected Lifetime.\\n    *   Missing Release of Resources after Effective Lifetime.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\\n\\n*   **Input Validation Issues:** Improper validation when processing ESI tags leads to vulnerabilities.\\n*   **Resource Management Issues:**  Problems with releasing resources result in memory leaks and use-after-free conditions.\\n*   **Error Handling Issues:**  Vulnerabilities occur when Squid processes errors during ESI parsing.\\n*   **Header Processing Issues:**  Squid is vulnerable when processing overlong headers in the context of ESI.\\n\\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\\n\\n*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A trusted server can exploit these vulnerabilities by sending specially crafted ESI responses to the Squid proxy, causing a denial of service for all clients using the proxy.\\n*   **Service Disruption:** The DoS affects all domains and clients serviced by the proxy.\\n\\n**Attack Vectors:**\\n\\n*   **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, as malicious ESI responses are sent over the network.\\n*   **Trusted Server:** The vulnerability is exploited by a trusted server that sends crafted ESI responses to the Squid proxy.\\n\\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\\n\\n*   **Trusted Server Access:** The attacker needs to control a server that is considered trusted by the Squid proxy.\\n*   **ESI Enabled:** The Squid proxy must have the ESI feature enabled.\\n*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable Squid proxy.\\n\\n**Additional Notes:**\\n\\n*   The ESI feature is enabled by default in Squid versions 3.0 to 6.9 but disabled by default since version 6.10. The vulnerability exists if ESI is enabled in versions 6.10+.\\n*   The vulnerability is limited to Squid acting as a reverse proxy with ESI enabled.\\n*   The NetApp advisory states that NetApp BlueXP is affected by this vulnerability because it incorporates Squid.\\n\\n**CVE Score:** 7.5 (High)\\n**CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H\\n\\nThe information provided in the GitHub advisory provides more specific details of the vulnerability than the information provided in the NetApp advisory.\", similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '',

    "enhanced_query": "# Vulnerability Description\n\n    Squid is an open source caching proxy for the Web supporting HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and more. Due to **Input Validation**, **Premature Release of Resource During Expected Lifetime**, **and Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime bugs**, Squid is vulnerable to Denial of Service attacks by a trusted server against all clients using the proxy. This bug is fixed in the default build configuration of Squid version 6.10.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'Premature Release of Resource During Expected Lifetime'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1.
