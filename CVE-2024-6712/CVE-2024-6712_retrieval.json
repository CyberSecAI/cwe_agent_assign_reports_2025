It details a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in MapFig Studio plugin versions up to and including 0.2.1. Here\\'s a breakdown of the extracted information:\\n\\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\\n\\nThe plugin lacks CSRF checks in certain areas and also lacks proper sanitization and escaping of user input.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\\n\\n*   Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\\n*   Missing CSRF protection\\n*   Insufficient input sanitization\\n*   Insufficient output escaping\\n\\n**Impact of exploitation:**\\n\\nAttackers can inject and store malicious XSS payloads, potentially compromising logged-in administrator accounts.\\n\\n**Attack vectors:**\\n\\n*   CSRF attack: An attacker can trick a logged-in administrator into submitting a malicious form.\\n*   The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates how to craft a malicious HTML form that, when submitted by a logged-in admin, injects a script that triggers an alert.\\n\\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\\n\\n*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious HTML form.\\n*   The attacker needs to be able to induce a logged-in administrator to visit a page containing the malicious form (CSRF).\\n\\n**Mitigation or fix:**\\n\\n*   The content states \"No known fix\" as of the provided information.  Implementing CSRF protection and proper input sanitization and output escaping are the recommended mitigations.\\n\\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\\n\\n*   **CVSS Score:** 7.1 (High)\\n*   **Researcher:** Vuln Seeker Cybersecurity Team\\n*   **WPVDB ID:** 0346b62c-a856-4554-a24a-ef2c2943bda9\\n*   **Proof of Concept:** A detailed HTML form is provided to demonstrate the vulnerability.\\n*   **Timeline:** Publicly published on 2024-06-05, added to the database on 2024-07-23, and last updated on 2024-07-23.\\n*   **OWASP Top 10 & CWE:**  The vulnerability is categorized under OWASP A7: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and CWE-79.', similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {}, 'top_cwes_by_threshold': {}}}, similarity_summary=SimilarityInsight(consensus_cwe='', top_cwes=[], confidence_levels={}, total_samples=0), analysis='', analysis_with_relationships='', criticism='', resolution='', relevant_cwes=[{'metadata': {'doc_id': '352', 'name': 'Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'rootcause:does not have CSRF check in some places', 'keyphrase': 'does not have CSRF check in some places', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'rootcause:missing sanitisation', 'keyphrase': 'missing sanitisation', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'rootcause:escaping', 'keyphrase': 'escaping', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'weakness:cross-site scripting', 'keyphrase': 'cross-site scripting', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'impact:Stored XSS payloads', 'keyphrase': 'Stored XSS payloads', 'type': 'impact'}, {'id': 'vector:CSRF attack', 'keyphrase': 'CSRF attack', 'type': 'vector'}, {'id': 'attacker:attackers', 'keyphrase': 'attackers', 'type': 'attacker'}, {'id': 'product:MapFig Studio WordPress plugin', 'keyphrase': 'MapFig Studio WordPress plugin', 'type': 'product'}, {'id': 'version:through 0.2.1', 'keyphrase': 'through 0.2.1', 'type': 'version'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(564.3490523192854)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '116', 'name': 'Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
