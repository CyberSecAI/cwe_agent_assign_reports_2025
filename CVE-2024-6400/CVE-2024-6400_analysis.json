Several other CWEs were considered, particularly those related to storage of sensitive information and encryption. CWE-311 is a class-level CWE that is the parent of CWE-312, but CWE-312 is more specific. Several variant-level CWEs, children of CWE-312, were considered, such as CWE-313, CWE-316, and CWE-317, but the description does not give enough evidence to select any of them.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe311[\"CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\"]\n    cwe313[\"CWE-313: Cleartext Storage in a File or on Disk\"]\n    cwe316[\"CWE-316: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in Memory\"]\n    cwe317[\"CWE-317: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in GUI\"]\n\n    cwe312 -->|CHILDOF| cwe311\n    cwe313 -->|CHILDOF| cwe312\n    cwe316 -->|CHILDOF| cwe312\n    cwe317 -->|CHILDOF| cwe312\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe312 primary\n    class cwe311,cwe313,cwe316,cwe317 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **cleartext storage of sensitive information** (CWE-312), which then leads to the ability to **retrieve embedded sensitive data**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that the root cause is **\"Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"**. This directly aligns with CWE-312. The retriever results also list CWE-312 as the top candidate. The description doesn't provide any information about where the information is stored so a child CWE like CWE-313, CWE-316, and CWE-317 cannot be selected.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n\nCWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n\n**CWE-312 was selected as the primary CWE.** The vulnerability description clearly indicates **cleartext storage of sensitive information** as the root cause. CWE-312 perfectly matches this description. The retriever results also list CWE-312 as the top candidate.\n\nOther CWEs Considered but Not Used:\n\n*   CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data: This is a higher-level class CWE and less specific than CWE-312. While the missing encryption is related, the description explicitly mentions cleartext storage, making CWE-312 a better fit.\n*   CWE-313: Cleartext Storage in a File or on Disk: This is a more specific variant of CWE-312. However, the vulnerability description doesn't mention specifically that the storage is in a file or on disk, making CWE-312 a more appropriate choice.\n*   CWE-316: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in Memory: Similar to CWE-313, this is a more specific variant, but the description lacks the detail to confirm the storage location is in memory.\n*   CWE-317: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in GUI: Similar to CWE-313, this is a more specific variant, but the description lacks the detail to confirm the storage location is in a GUI.\n*   CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials: While credentials might be involved, the main issue is the cleartext storage itself, not necessarily the protection mechanism.\n* CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort: The description focuses on cleartext storage, not hashing algorithms.\n* CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File: There's no indication that the information is being stored in a log file.\n* CWE-36: Absolute Path Traversal: This CWE is unrelated to the vulnerability description.\n* CWE-523: Unprotected Transport of Credentials: The vulnerability is focused on storage, not transport.",
