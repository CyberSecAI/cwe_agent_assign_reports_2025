  "description": "IrfanView DXF File Parsing Memory Corruption Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of IrfanView. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of DXF files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a **memory corruption** condition. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-24702.",

The user has to open the malicious file with the vulnerable software or visit a malicious page that triggers the parsing of a malicious DXF file.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious DXF file. The attacker does not need a privileged position on the system but needs user interaction.",

CWE-787 is a more specific instance of the general **improper input validation** issue described by CWE-20. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions both **lack of proper validation** (pointing to CWE-20) and **memory corruption** (often caused by out-of-bounds writes, pointing to CWE-787).

This then results in **memory corruption**, which can ultimately lead to remote code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment strongly pointed to CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) due to the **memory corruption** condition directly resulting from a **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data.** The \"CWE for similar CVE Descriptions\" section also lists CWE-787 as the \"Primary CWE Match\" and the most frequent CWE.\n\nCWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) was considered as a secondary factor because the **lack of proper validation** is the root cause that allows the out-of-bounds write to occur.
