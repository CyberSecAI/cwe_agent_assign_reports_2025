This indicates a hierarchical relationship where CWE-95 is a more specific type of code injection. CWE-94 is a more general case of code injection. The analysis considered the hierarchical relationship between CWE-95 and CWE-94, opting for the more specific CWE-95 due to the presence of `eval()` usage.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe95[\"CWE-95: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection')\"]\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    \n    cwe95 -->|CHILDOF| cwe94\n    cwe94 -->|PARENT OF| cwe95\n    \n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe95 primary\n    class cwe94,cwe20 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper input sanitization** (not explicitly CWE mapped as it's too general) leading to **unsafe eval in sympy.sympify** (CWE-95) which results in arbitrary code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is **improper neutralization** in dynamically evaluated code, specifically the use of `eval()` in `sympy.sympify()`. The evidence explicitly mentions the use of `eval()` and the lack of proper input sanitization. This aligns perfectly with the description of CWE-95.
