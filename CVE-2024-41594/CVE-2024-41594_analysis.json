It is related to CWE-338 (Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)), which could also apply, but is less specific.

The **rootcause** is clearly identified as the use of a **static string for seeding the PRNG**. The best fit for this issue is CWE-337 (Predictable Seed in Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)), which is a variant level CWE.
