# Vulnerability Description

    In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved net fix geneve_opt length **integer overflow** struct geneve_opt uses 5 bit length for each single option, which means every vary size option should be smaller than 128 bytes. However, all current related Netlink policies cannot promise this length condition and the attacker can exploit a exact 128-byte size option to *fake* a zero length option and confuse the parsing logic, further achieve heap out-of-bounds read. One example crash log is like below [ 3.905425] ================================================================== [ 3.905925] BUG KASAN slab-out-of-bounds in nla_put+0xa9/0xe0 [ 3.906255] Read of size 124 at addr ffff888005f291cc by task poc/177 [ 3.906646] [ 3.906775] CPU 0 PID 177 Comm poc-oob-read Not tainted 6.1.132 #1 [ 3.907131] Hardware name QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS rel-1.16.0-0-gd239552ce722-prebuilt.qemu.org 04/01/2014 [ 3.907784] Call Trace [ 3.907925] [ 3.908048] dump_stack_lvl+0x44/0x5c [ 3.908258] print_report+0x184/0x4be [ 3.909151] kasan_report+0xc5/0x100 [ 3.909539] kasan_check_range+0xf3/0x1a0 [ 3.909794] memcpy+0x1f/0x60 [ 3.909968] nla_put+0xa9/0xe0 [ 3.910147] tunnel_key_dump+0x945/0xba0 [ 3.911536] tcf_action_dump_1+0x1c1/0x340 [ 3.912436] tcf_action_dump+0x101/0x180 [ 3.912689] tcf_exts_dump+0x164/0x1e0 [ 3.912905] fw_dump+0x18b/0x2d0 [ 3.913483] tcf_fill_node+0x2ee/0x460 [ 3.914778] tfilter_notify+0xf4/0x180 [ 3.915208] tc_new_tfilter+0xd51/0x10d0 [ 3.918615] rtnetlink_rcv_msg+0x4a2/0x560 [ 3.919118] netlink_rcv_skb+0xcd/0x200 [ 3.919787] netlink_unicast+0x395/0x530 [ 3.921032] netlink_sendmsg+0x3d0/0x6d0 [ 3.921987] __sock_sendmsg+0x99/0xa0 [ 3.922220] __sys_sendto+0x1b7/0x240 [ 3.922682] __x64_sys_sendto+0x72/0x90 [ 3.922906] do_syscall_64+0x5e/0x90 [ 3.923814] entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x6e/0xd8 [ 3.924122] RIP 00330x7e83eab84407 [ 3.924331] Code 48 89 fa 4c 89 df e8 38 aa 00 00 8b 93 08 03 00 00 59 5e 48 83 f8 fc 74 1a 5b c3 0f 1f 84 00 00 00 00 00 48 8b 44 24 10 0f 05 c3 0f 1f 80 00 00 00 00 83 e2 39 83 faf [ 3.925330] RSP 002b00007ffff505e370 EFLAGS 00000202 ORIG_RAX 000000000000002c [ 3.925752] RAX ffffffffffffffda RBX 00007e83eaafa740 RCX 00007e83eab84407 [ 3.926173] RDX 00000000000001a8 RSI 00007ffff505e3c0 RDI 0000000000000003 [ 3.926587] RBP 00007ffff505f460 R08 00007e83eace1000 R09 000000000000000c [ 3.926977] R10 0000000000000000 R11 0000000000000202 R12 00007ffff505f3c0 [ 3.927367] R13 00007ffff505f5c8 R14 00007e83ead1b000 R15 00005d4fbbe6dcb8 Fix these issues by enforing correct length condition in related policies.
