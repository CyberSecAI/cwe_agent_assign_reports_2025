  "query": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved md/raid5 fix deadlock that raid5d() wait for itself to clear MD_SB_CHANGE_PENDING Xiao reported that lvm2 test lvconvert-raid-takeover.sh can hang with small possibility, the root cause is exactly the same as commit bed9e27baf52 (Revert md/raid5 Wait for MD_SB_CHANGE_PENDING in raid5d) However, Dan reported another hang after that, and junxiao investigated the problem and found out that this is caused by plugged bio cant issue from raid5d(). Current implementation in raid5d() has a weird dependence 1) md_check_recovery() from raid5d() must hold reconfig_mutex to clear MD_SB_CHANGE_PENDING 2) raid5d() handles IO in a deadloop, until all IO are issued 3) IO from raid5d() must wait for MD_SB_CHANGE_PENDING to be cleared This behaviour is introduce before v2.6, and for consequence, if other context hold reconfig_mutex, and md_check_recovery() cant update super_block, then raid5d() will waste one cpu 100% by the deadloop, until reconfig_mutex is released. Refer to the implementation from raid1 and raid10, fix this problem by skipping issue IO if MD_SB_CHANGE_PENDING is still set after md_check_recovery(), daemon thread will be woken up when reconfig_mutex is released. Meanwhile, the hang problem will be fixed as well.",
