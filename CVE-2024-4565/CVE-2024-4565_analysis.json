CWE-862 Missing Authorization is a child of CWE-288 Authentication Bypass and CWE-287 Improper Authentication. The vulnerability involves bypassing access control checks, which falls under the umbrella of authorization issues.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe288[\"CWE-288: Authentication Bypass\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe288\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe201 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **Missing Authorization** (CWE-862), leading to the **insertion of sensitive information into sent data** (CWE-201), and ultimately resulting in information disclosure. The root cause is the **lack of access control checks** when displaying custom field values via shortcodes.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The **Vulnerability Description** and **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** sections clearly indicate that the Advanced Custom Fields plugin lacks proper access control checks when displaying custom field values via shortcodes. This **missing authorization** allows unauthorized users to access sensitive information, leading to information disclosure.\n\nCWE-862 (Missing Authorization) is selected as the primary CWE because it accurately represents the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **absence of proper authorization checks**. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" states that the vulnerability involves \"Broken Access Control\" and \"Improper Authorization\".\n\nCWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data) is included as a secondary CWE because the **missing authorization** leads to the **exposure of sensitive information**. The vulnerability allows a contributor-level user to access and view custom field values of any post, including private and password-protected posts, which means sensitive information is being inserted into the sent data without proper authorization.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-862 is a Class-level CWE, but it accurately represents the **lack of authorization checks**. The retriever results also list other relevant CWEs such as CWE-425 (Direct Request), CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key), and CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization). However, CWE-862 is more appropriate because the vulnerability involves a complete **lack of authorization checks**, rather than an incorrect or bypassed authorization mechanism.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.\n\n*Not Selected*: This vulnerability is not related to CSRF.\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected*: While the vulnerability involves user-controlled input (post ID or option name), the core issue is the **lack of authorization**, not the external control of immutable parameters.\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected*: CWE-425 is similar, but CWE-862 is a better fit because it's more specific to **missing authorization** checks.\n\n## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected*: This vulnerability is not related to file uploads.\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.67\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected*: While the attacker needs to know/guess a valid post ID or option name (which could be considered a \"key\"), the fundamental issue is the **lack of authorization** checks, not specifically the bypass through a user-controlled key.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.65\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
