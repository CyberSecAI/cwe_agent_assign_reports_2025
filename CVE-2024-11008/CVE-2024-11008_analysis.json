The retriever results also listed CWE-862 as a potential candidate.\nCWE-200 is related to other CWEs through hierarchical and chain relationships, but none of those relationships affected the selection.\nCWE-862 is a parent of more specific Base-level CWEs.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe862 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is as follows:\n1.  **Missing Authorization** (CWE-862): The WordPress plugin **failed to properly restrict access to content** when using the WordPress core search feature.\n2.  **Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor** (CWE-200): This **allowed unauthenticated users to bypass content restrictions** and **extract sensitive data from posts** intended for higher-level roles.\n\nCWE-862 is the root cause (the authorization was missing), which led to CWE-200 (sensitive information was exposed).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on the **Sensitive Information Exposure** due to a **failure to properly restrict access**. The provided evidence clearly states that \"The Members plugin for WordPress **failed to properly restrict access to content** when using the WordPress core search feature. This **allowed unauthenticated users to bypass content restrictions** set by the plugin.\"\nThis aligns with CWE-200, Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor. While CWE-862, Missing Authorization, was also considered, CWE-200 was a better fit because the vulnerability description emphasizes the exposure of sensitive information as the primary impact. However, CWE-862 could be a prerequisite or related issue (authorization was missing, thus information was exposed).\nThe selection of CWE-200 is at the Class level, and no more specific CWEs are obviously applicable from the retriever results.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n##
