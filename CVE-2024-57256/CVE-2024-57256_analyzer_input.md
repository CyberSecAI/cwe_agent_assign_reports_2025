# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-57256

## Vulnerability Description
An **integer overflow** in ext4fs_read_symlink in Das U-Boot before 2025.01-rc1 occurs for zalloc (adding one to an le32 variable) via a crafted ext4 filesystem with an inode size of 0xffffffff, resulting in a malloc of zero and resultant memory overwrite.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **integer overflow**
- **impact:** memory overwrite
- **vector:** crafted ext4 filesystem with an inode size of 0xffffffff
- **product:** Das U-Boot
- **version:** before 2025.01-rc1
- **component:** ext4fs_read_symlink

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Integer overflows and stack overflows in U-Boot's handling of SquashFS and ext4 filesystem data structures, as well as integer overflows in the memory allocator and heap corruption in the SquashFS directory listing function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - CVE-2024-57254: Integer overflow in SquashFS symlink size calculation.
    - CVE-2024-57255: Integer overflow in SquashFS symlink resolution.
    - CVE-2024-57256: Integer overflow in ext4 symlink resolution.
    - CVE-2024-57257: Stack overflow in SquashFS symlink resolution.
    - CVE-2024-57258: Multiple integer overflows in the memory allocator.
    - CVE-2024-57259: Heap corruption in SquashFS directory listing.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker capable of modifying filesystem data can exploit memory corruption vulnerabilities. For systems with verified boot, this allows bypassing the chain of trust and achieving code execution. CVE-2024-57258 may be exploitable in other subsystems as well.
- **Attack vectors:** Modifying ext4 or SquashFS filesystem data structures.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to modify filesystem data.
- **Mitigation or fix:** Upgrade to version v2025.01-rc1 or newer. Patches are available at the provided links.
