For systems with verified boot, this allows bypassing the chain of trust and achieving code execution. CVE-2024-57258 may be exploitable in other subsystems as well.\n- **Attack vectors:** Modifying ext4 or SquashFS filesystem data structures.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to modify filesystem data.\n- **Mitigation or fix:** Upgrade to version v2025.01-rc1 or newer. Patches are available at the provided links.\n\nThe content provides more detail than the official CVE description by listing all the vulnerabilities and providing links to the specific commits that fix them.",

This then leads to a memory overwrite, which can be classified as an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787). The relationship is that CWE-190 can precede CWE-787. CWE-190 is a base level weakness and CWE-787 is also a base level weakness.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe190[\"CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe190 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe787\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe190 primary\n    class cwe787 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **integer overflow** (CWE-190) when calculating the allocation size, which results in a zero-sized allocation. Subsequently, writing to this zero-sized buffer leads to a memory overwrite (CWE-787), which is a type of out-of-bounds write.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is clearly identified as an **integer overflow** (CWE-190). The vulnerability description explicitly states: \"An **integer overflow** in ext4fs_read_symlink... occurs for zalloc (adding one to an le32 variable) via a crafted ext4 filesystem with an inode size of 0xffffffff, resulting in a malloc of zero and resultant memory overwrite.\" This aligns directly with the definition of CWE-190. The **integer overflow** leads to a zero-sized memory allocation, and the subsequent write operation results in a memory overwrite, which can be categorized as an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787). Both CWEs are at the Base level of abstraction, making them the most specific and appropriate choices.\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs a calculation that can\n         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic\n         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than\n         the original value.
