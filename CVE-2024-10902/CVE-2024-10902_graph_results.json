This vulnerability allows unauthorized attackers to upload arbitrary files to the victims file system at any location. The impact of this vulnerability includes the potential for remote code execution (RCE) by writing malicious files, such as a malicious `__init__.py` in the Pythons `/site-packages/` directory.",
