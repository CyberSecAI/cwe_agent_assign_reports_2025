This allows unauthenticated users to view content that should be restricted to higher-level roles, such as site members.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\\n- **Unauthenticated Content Restriction Bypass**: The plugin does not correctly enforce content restrictions when users perform a search.\\n- **Sensitive Information Exposure**: The vulnerability leads to the exposure of restricted content to unauthorized users.\\n\\n**Impact of exploitation:**\\n- **Information Disclosure:** Unauthenticated attackers can gain access to sensitive data from posts that are meant to be restricted to members or other specific roles.\\n\\n**Attack vectors:**\\n- **WordPress core search feature:** The vulnerability is exploited by using the standard WordPress search functionality.\\n\\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\\n- **Unauthenticated access:** Attackers do not need to log in or have any special privileges to exploit this vulnerability.\\n- **Knowledge of WordPress search:** Attackers need to use the WordPress search to trigger the vulnerability.\\n\\n**Additional details:**\\n- The vulnerability exists in all versions of the Memberful plugin up to and including 1.73.9.\\n- The issue was addressed in version 1.74.0 of the plugin, which excludes protected posts from search results.\\n```', similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {},
