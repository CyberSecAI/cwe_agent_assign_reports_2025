This allows unauthenticated users to view content that should be restricted to higher-level roles, such as site members.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- **Unauthenticated Content Restriction Bypass**: The plugin does not correctly enforce content restrictions when users perform a search.\n- **Sensitive Information Exposure**: The vulnerability leads to the exposure of restricted content to unauthorized users.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- **Information Disclosure:** Unauthenticated attackers can gain access to sensitive data from posts that are meant to be restricted to members or other specific roles.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- **WordPress core search feature:** The vulnerability is exploited by using the standard WordPress search functionality.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- **Unauthenticated access:** Attackers do not need to log in or have any special privileges to exploit this vulnerability.\n- **Knowledge of WordPress search:** Attackers need to use the WordPress search to trigger the vulnerability.\n\n**Additional details:**\n- The vulnerability exists in all versions of the Memberful plugin up to and including 1.73.9.\n- The issue was addressed in version 1.74.0 of the plugin, which excludes protected posts from search results.\n```",

  "analysis": "# Summary\n| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| CWE-200 | Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor | 1.0 | Base | Primary | Allowed |\n| CWE-862 | Missing Authorization | 0.8 | Class | Secondary Candidate | Allowed-with-Review |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-200 [Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor], which directly reflects the vulnerability's description of **sensitive information exposure**. The secondary candidate is CWE-862 [Missing Authorization], which represents the root cause of the **sensitive information exposure** because the plugin does not perform authorization checks, allowing unauthenticated users access to restricted data. CWE-862 is a class-level CWE and could potentially have a more specific child CWE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe200\n    cwe862\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe862 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authorization** (CWE-862), leading to **sensitive information exposure** (CWE-200). An unauthenticated attacker exploits the missing authorization in the WordPress core search feature to extract sensitive data from posts restricted to higher-level roles.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-200 [Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor] as the primary weakness, directly aligning with the **'Sensitive Information Exposure'** vulnerability description. The analysis further considered CWE-862 [Missing Authorization] as the root cause, as the lack of authorization checks enables the **sensitive information exposure**. The description states \"This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to **extract sensitive data** from posts that have been restricted to higher-level roles such as site members.\"\n\nThe graph relationships show that while CWE-200 directly describes the vulnerability, CWE-862 represents the underlying **missing authorization** that enables the **exposure**. Therefore, both CWEs are relevant, with CWE-200 as the primary manifestation and CWE-862 as a contributing factor.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at an appropriate level of specificity. CWE-200 is a base-level CWE that accurately describes the **sensitive information exposure**. CWE-862 is a class-level CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-425: Direct
