## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability has been identified in Mendix Encryption (All versions >= V10.0.0 < V10.0.2). Affected versions of the module define a **specific hard-coded default value for the EncryptionKey constant**, which is used in projects where no individual EncryptionKey was specified. This could allow to an attacker to decrypt any encrypted project data, as the default encryption key can be considered compromised.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **specific hard-coded default value for the EncryptionKey constant**
- **impact:** decrypt any encrypted project data
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** Mendix Encryption
- **version:** All versions >= V10.0.0 < V10.0.2

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Mendix Encryption module versions V10.0.0 and V10.0.1 use a hard-coded default value for the EncryptionKey constant. This key is used when no specific encryption key is configured in the project.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is the use of a hard-coded, security-relevant constant, specifically the encryption key (CWE-547). This makes the default encryption key easily compromised.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can decrypt any encrypted project data if the default encryption key was used in the Mendix project.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network (AV:N).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need any special privileges or user interaction to exploit this vulnerability (PR:N, UI:N). They just need to be able to access the encrypted data.
