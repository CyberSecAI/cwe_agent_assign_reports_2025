  "description": "A flaw was found in the skupper console, a read-only interface that renders cluster network, traffic details, and metrics for a network application that a user sets up across a hybrid multi-cloud environment. When the default authentication method is used, a random password is generated for the admin user and is persisted in either a Kubernetes secret or a podman volume in a plaintext file. This authentication method can be manipulated by an attacker, leading to the **reading of any user-readable file in the container filesystem**, directly impacting data confidentiality. Additionally, the attacker may induce skupper to read extremely large files into memory, resulting in resource exhaustion and a denial of service attack.",

A randomly generated password for the \"admin\" user is stored in plaintext either in a Kubernetes secret or a podman volume.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- **Plaintext storage of credentials**: The admin password is saved in a plaintext file.\n- **Flawed authentication method:** The authentication method can be manipulated to bypass authentication.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- **Arbitrary file read**: An attacker can read any user-readable file in the container filesystem, leading to data confidentiality breaches.\n- **Denial of service (DoS):** An attacker can induce skupper to read extremely large files into memory, resulting in resource exhaustion and a denial-of-service condition.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- Network access to the skupper console is required.\n- Manipulation of the flawed authentication method.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- The attacker needs network access to the skupper console.\n- The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the flawed basic authentication method.",

Secondary weaknesses include **CWE-22 Path Traversal** and **CWE-770 Resource Allocation Without Limits or Throttling**. **CWE-22** is relevant because the attacker can **read any user-readable file in the container filesystem**. **CWE-770** is relevant because an attacker may induce skupper to read extremely large files into memory, resulting in resource exhaustion.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe256[\"CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\"]\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe256 primary\n    class cwe22,cwe770 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **CWE-256 Plaintext Storage of a Password**. This leads to an attacker gaining unauthorized access to the system. The attacker can then perform **CWE-22 Path Traversal**, allowing them to **read any user-readable file in the container filesystem**. Additionally, the attacker can trigger **CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling**, leading to **CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption** and a denial-of-service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nBased on the provided evidence, the primary weakness is clearly the **CWE-256 Plaintext Storage of a Password**, as the vulnerability description explicitly states that the admin password is stored in plaintext. This is supported by the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section, which states, \"**Plaintext storage of credentials**: The admin password is saved in a plaintext file.\"\n\nThe secondary weaknesses are **CWE-22 Path Traversal** and **CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling**. The evidence for **CWE-22** is in the vulnerability description which states the attacker can perform the \"**reading of any user-readable file in the container filesystem**\". The evidence for **CWE-770** is that \"**the attacker may induce skupper to read extremely large files into memory, resulting in resource exhaustion and a denial of service attack**\". The related **CWE-400** is the result of that resource exhaustion.\n\nThe graph relationships helped clarify the potential impact of the **CWE-770** leading to **CWE-400**.
