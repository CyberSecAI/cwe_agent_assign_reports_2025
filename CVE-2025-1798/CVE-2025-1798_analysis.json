Potentially stealing authentication cookies for other services running on the same website.\n*   **Attack vectors:** Injecting XSS payloads into the `radioResponse` or `freeText` parameters. The attacker then waits for an administrator to view the ratings via the WordPress dashboard.\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to submit data to the vulnerable form. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability, but they must wait for an administrator to view their malicious input.\n*   **Mitigation or fix:** Update to version 1.11.2 or newer.\n*   **More detail than the official CVE description:** This content provides a detailed technical analysis, proof of concept (PoC), and attack vector details.\n\n**Content from a8cteam5105.wordpress.com_535e34f9_20250624_211439.html (text)**\n\n*   **Relates to CVE:** YES\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unauthenticated Stored XSS.\n*   **Mitigation or fix:** Fixed in version 1.1.2.\n*   **More detail than the official CVE description:** This content also provides a reference to a PoC, and other related information.\n\n**Content from github.com_1799fe7a_20250624_211440.html (stripped)**\n\n*   **Relates to CVE:** YES\n*   **Mitigation or fix:**  Mentions the fix in version 1.11.2.\n\n**Content from wpscan.com_52345df1_20250624_202428.html (stripped)**\n\n*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape some parameters when outputting them back in a page.\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unauthenticated stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks.\n*   **Impact of exploitation:** The attacker can perform stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks.\n*   **Attack vectors:** Send a POST request to `admin-ajax.php` with a crafted payload in the `radioResponse` or `freeText` parameters. Then, as admin, open the \"Ratings\" area of the plugin to trigger the XSS.\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Unauthenticated users can perform stored XSS. The attacker must wait for an admin to view the crafted rating to trigger the vulnerability.\n*   **Mitigation or fix:** Fixed in version 1.1.2.\n*   **More detail than the official CVE description:** The content provides a detailed description, Proof of Concept (PoC), and related information.",

CWE-80 is a variant of CWE-79, focusing on script-related HTML tags. CWE-116 is a class-level CWE indicating improper encoding or escaping, which is a broader category that includes XSS prevention. The selection of CWE-79 as primary is because it directly reflects the vulnerability description and CVE details related to XSS. The other two CWEs are related and considered.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe80[\"CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\"]\n    cwe116[\"CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\"]\n    \n    cwe80 -->|CHILDOF| cwe79\n    cwe79 -->|PARENTOF| cwe80\n    cwe79 -->|PEEROF| cwe116\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe79 primary\n    class cwe80,cwe116 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper sanitization** of user input (`radioResponse`, `freeText`) when stored in the database. This leads to **improper neutralization of input during web page generation** when the data is rendered in the WordPress admin dashboard. The final impact is the ability for unauthenticated users to perform stored **Cross-Site Scripting** attacks.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary assessment is based on the vulnerability description, which explicitly mentions the lack of sanitization and escaping of parameters, leading to stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks. The CVE reference links content summary further confirms this, highlighting the root cause as the lack of proper sanitization of user input from `radioResponse` and `freeText` parameters.\n\nThe selection of CWE-79 is justified by the direct match between the vulnerability description and the CWE's characteristics. CWE-79 describes the **improper neutralization** of user-controllable input before it's placed in output used as a web page. This aligns perfectly with the reported vulnerability, where user input is not properly sanitized before being rendered in the admin dashboard, leading to XSS.\n\nCWE-80 was considered as a more specific variant but the description doesn't explicitly focus on HTML tags, therefore, CWE-79 is a more appropriate fit. CWE-116 was also considered as a class-level weakness related to encoding and escaping, but the root cause is specifically the lack of neutralization of input for web page generation, making CWE-79 the primary weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.\n\n\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Considered:** This is a more specific type of XSS, but the description doesn't focus on the HTML tags so this would be a secondary candidate.\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
