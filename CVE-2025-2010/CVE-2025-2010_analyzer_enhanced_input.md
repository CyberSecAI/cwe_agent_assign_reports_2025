## Vulnerability Description
The JobWP Job Board, Job Listing, Career Page and Recruitment Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the jobwp_upload_resume parameter in all versions up to, and including, 2.3.9 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.
