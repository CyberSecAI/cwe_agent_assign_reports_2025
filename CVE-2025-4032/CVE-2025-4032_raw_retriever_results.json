This issue affects the function subprocess.run/subprocess.Popen of the file AWorld/aworld/virtual_environments/terminals/shell_tool.py. The manipulation leads to os command injection. The attack may be initiated remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation is known to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. This product does not use versioning. This is why information about affected and unaffected releases are unavailable.",
