# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-11250

## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability was found in code-projects Inventory Management up to 1.0. It has been declared as critical. This vulnerability affects unknown code of the file /model/editProduct.php. The manipulation of the argument id leads to **sql injection**. The attack can be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **sql injection**
- **product:** code-projects Inventory Management
- **version:** up to 1.0
- **component:** /model/editProduct.php

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-11250 (based on the context, although the description is a placeholder)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the improper handling of the `id` parameter in the `editProduct.php` script. This parameter is taken directly from the GET request and inserted into an SQL query without any sanitization or escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Time-Based SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to time-based SQL injection due to the lack of proper input sanitization when constructing the SQL query.
*   **Direct use of user input in SQL query:** The vulnerable code directly incorporates user-supplied input (`$_GET['id']`) into the SQL query without any sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Exposure:** Attackers can extract sensitive data from the database.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The use of time-based SQL injection can cause delays or a denial of service due to functions like `SLEEP()`.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Further exploitation could lead to unauthorized access or modification of critical data.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to the `editProduct.php` script, manipulating the `id` parameter in the URL.
*   **URL Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker injects malicious SQL code directly into the `id` parameter of the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
*   **Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL to craft injection payloads and needs to be able to identify SQL injection vulnerabilities.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is located in the `editProduct.php` file.
*   The vulnerable code snippet is:
    ```php
    <?php
        $id = $_GET['id']; // Vulnerable to SQL Injection
        $sql = "SELECT * FROM products WHERE id='$id' LIMIT 1";
        $res = mysqli_fetch_assoc($conn->query($sql));
    ?>
    ```
*   A proof of concept (PoC) payload is provided:
    `<http://localhost/online-shop/editProduct.php?id=12%27XOR(if(now()=sysdate(),sleep(5),0))XOR%27Z>`
    This payload uses the `SLEEP()` function to cause a delay, demonstrating the time-based SQL injection.
*   The content mentions that `sqlmap` can be used to automate exploitation once the vulnerability is identified.

**Mitigation:**
*   Use prepared statements with parameterized queries (e.g., `mysqli_prepare`).
*   Implement Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) libraries.
*   Validate and sanitize user inputs.
*   Set SQL query timeouts.
