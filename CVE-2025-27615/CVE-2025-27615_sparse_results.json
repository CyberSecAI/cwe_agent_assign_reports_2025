  "query": "umatiGateway is software for connecting OPC Unified Architecture servers with an MQTT broker utilizing JSON messages. The user interface may possibly be publicly accessible with umatiGateways provided docker-compose file. With this access, the configuration can be viewed and altered. Commit 5d81a3412bc0051754a3095d89a06d6d743f2b16 uses `127.0.0.180808080` to limit access to the local network. For those who are unable to use this proposed patch, a firewall on Port 8080 may block remote access, but the workaround may not be perfect because Docker may also bypass a firewall by its iptable based rules for port forwarding.",
