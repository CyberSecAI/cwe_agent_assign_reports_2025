## Vulnerability Description
umatiGateway is software for connecting OPC Unified Architecture servers with an MQTT broker utilizing JSON messages. The user interface may possibly be publicly accessible with umatiGateways provided docker-compose file. With this access, the configuration can be viewed and altered. Commit 5d81a3412bc0051754a3095d89a06d6d743f2b16 uses `127.0.0.180808080` to limit access to the local network. For those who are unable to use this proposed patch, a firewall on Port 8080 may block remote access, but the workaround may not be perfect because Docker may also bypass a firewall by its iptable based rules for port forwarding.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-27615 based on provided content

The provided content relates to CVE-2025-27615. It provides more detail than the placeholder CVE description.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from binding the UI to all interfaces (0.0.0.0) in the `docker-compose` file, making it publicly accessible.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Publicly accessible UI due to incorrect port binding in the `docker-compose` file.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Configuration can be viewed and altered by unauthorized users.

**Attack vectors:**

*   Network access to the exposed port (8080).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   Network access to the server running the `umatiGateway` application. No specific privileges or user interaction are required.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   Use `"127.0.0.1:8080:8080"` in the `docker-compose` file to bind the UI to the localhost interface only.
*   Implement a firewall on port 8080, although the content notes Docker may bypass firewall rules.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerable line in the `docker-compose` file (in commit `abe73096a17307327f0d6dc0ed4db1fb93464521`) is:

```yaml
- 8080:8080
```

The corrected line is:

```yaml
- "127.0.0.1:8080:8080"
```

The fix is implemented in commit `e4f11f6d28d0a59db04a5717f8cbf0fe41a8572e`.

**CVSS v3 base metrics:**

*   Attack Vector: Network
*   Attack Complexity: Low
*   Privileges Required: None
*   User Interaction: None
*   Scope: Unchanged
*   Confidentiality: None
*   Integrity: Low
*   Availability: High
