  "query": "A request smuggling vulnerability existed in the Google Cloud Classic Application Load Balancer due to improper handling of chunked-encoded HTTP requests. This allowed attackers to craft requests that could be misinterpreted by backend servers. The issue was fixed by disallowing stray data after a chunk, and is no longer exploitable. No action is required as Classic Application Load Balancer service after 2025-04-26 is not vulnerable.",
