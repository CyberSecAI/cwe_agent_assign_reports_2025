## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-6446:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the normalization of redirect URIs during the OAuth authorization process. Specifically, the application's code extracts the host from the URI and then performs a global string replacement to remove `www.` prefixes, e.g., `domain = URI.parse([@]pre_auth.redirect_uri).host.gsub('www.', '')`

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The code does not properly sanitize the host part of the redirect URI, allowing an attacker to register a redirect URI like `https://giwww.tlab.com`.
- **URL Spoofing/Misrepresentation:** The removal of `www.` via simple string replacement creates an opportunity for an attacker to make a malicious URL visually appear like the legitimate one to the end-user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **OAuth Flow Manipulation:** By registering an application with a spoofed redirect URL, an attacker can trick a user into granting access to their account. The user is shown a legitimate-looking URL (e.g., `gitlab.com`) in the authorization UI, while the actual redirect takes them to an attacker-controlled site.
- **Account Compromise:** If the user authorizes the attacker's application, the attacker can potentially gain access to the user's GitLab account or perform actions on their behalf.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker registers a malicious OAuth application in GitLab.
- The attacker uses a crafted redirect URI that visually resembles a trusted domain.
- The victim is tricked into authorizing the attacker's application, which then redirects them to the malicious URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to register a new OAuth application in GitLab.
- The attacker must be able to set a redirect URI during the application registration process.
- The attacker must trick a victim to visit the authorization endpoint

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is described as a low severity issue.
- This vulnerability was reported through the HackerOne bug bounty program by `joaxcar`
- The vulnerability affects GitLab CE/EE and was patched in versions 17.1.7, 17.2.5, and 17.3.2.
- The report includes a step-by-step guide on how to reproduce the vulnerability.
- CVSS score is 3.5 `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N`
