# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-89 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') | 0.9 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-862 | Missing Authorization | 0.7 | Class | Secondary | Allowed-with-Review |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is **CWE-89**, which represents the **SQL injection** vulnerability. This is a base-level CWE, providing a specific description of the flaw. **CWE-89** is related to **CWE-74** (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')) as a child, indicating it's a specific type of injection. **CWE-862** is a class-level weakness related to missing authorization, which is a contributing factor but not the root cause. The prompt injection leads to **SQL injection** because the input isn't neutralized, so the system doesn't properly authorize actions.

## Vulnerability Chain
1.  Prompt injection (user-controlled input).
2.  **CWE-89** (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')): The application fails to neutralize special elements in the SQL command.
3.  **CWE-862** (Missing Authorization): The system does not properly authorize the action based on the injected SQL command.
4.  Data manipulation, exfiltration, denial of service, and data integrity issues.

## Summary of Analysis
The primary weakness is **CWE-89** because the vulnerability description explicitly states "**SQL injection** through prompt injection." The retriever results also identify **CWE-89** as a strong candidate. The "Vulnerability Description Key Phrases" section also highlights "**weakness: SQL injection**". While the phrase "**rootcause: improper authorization**" is present, the direct mechanism of the attack is **SQL injection**.

**CWE-862** (Missing Authorization) is a secondary concern, as the **SQL injection** allows unauthorized actions. The guidance indicates that we need to differentiate between authentication and authorization. In this case, the authorization is bypassed due to the **SQL injection**, making it a secondary weakness.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. **CWE-89** is a base-level CWE, providing a specific description of the flaw.
Relevant CWE Information:
# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.



## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-943: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Data Query Logic
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product generates a query intended to access or manipulate data in a data store such as a database, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that can modify the intended logic of the query.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-1286: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input that is expected to be well-formed - i.e., to comply with a certain syntax - but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input complies with the syntax.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
