  "description": "A vulnerability in the GraphCypherQAChain class of langchain-ai/langchain version 0.2.5 allows for **SQL injection** through prompt injection. This vulnerability can lead to unauthorized data manipulation, data exfiltration, denial of service (DoS) by deleting all data, breaches in multi-tenant security environments, and data integrity issues. Attackers can create, update, or delete nodes and relationships without proper authorization, extract sensitive data, disrupt services, access data across different tenants, and compromise the integrity of the database.",

This is a base-level CWE, providing a specific description of the flaw. **CWE-89** is related to **CWE-74** (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')) as a child, indicating it's a specific type of injection. **CWE-862** is a class-level weakness related to missing authorization, which is a contributing factor but not the root cause. The prompt injection leads to **SQL injection** because the input isn't neutralized, so the system doesn't properly authorize actions.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe89 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe89 primary\n    class cwe74,cwe862 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n1.  Prompt injection (user-controlled input).\n2.  **CWE-89** (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')): The application fails to neutralize special elements in the SQL command.\n3.  **CWE-862** (Missing Authorization): The system does not properly authorize the action based on the injected SQL command.\n4.  Data manipulation, exfiltration, denial of service, and data integrity issues.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is **CWE-89** because the vulnerability description explicitly states \"**SQL injection** through prompt injection.\" The retriever results also identify **CWE-89** as a strong candidate. The \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section also highlights \"**weakness: SQL injection**\". While the phrase \"**rootcause: improper authorization**\" is present, the direct mechanism of the attack is **SQL injection**.\n\n**CWE-862** (Missing Authorization) is a secondary concern, as the **SQL injection** allows unauthorized actions. The guidance indicates that we need to differentiate between authentication and authorization. In this case, the authorization is bypassed due to the **SQL injection**, making it a secondary weakness.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. **CWE-89** is a base-level CWE, providing a specific description of the flaw.\nRelevant CWE Information:\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-943: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Data Query Logic\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product generates a query intended to access or manipulate data in a data store such as a database, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that can modify the intended logic of the query.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-1286: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input that is expected to be well-formed -
