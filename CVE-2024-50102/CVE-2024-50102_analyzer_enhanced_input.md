## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved x86 fix user address masking **non-canonical speculation issue** It turns out that AMD has a Meltdown Lite(tm) issue with non-canonical accesses in kernel space. And so using just the high bit to decide whether an access is in user space or kernel space ends up with the good old leak speculative data if you have the right gadget using the result CVE-2020-12965 Transient Execution of Non-Canonical Accesses Now, the kernel surrounds the access with a STAC/CLAC pair, and those instructions end up serializing execution on older Zen architectures, which closes the speculation window. But that was true only up until Zen 5, which renames the AC bit [1]. That improves performance of STAC/CLAC a lot, but also means that the speculation window is now open. Note that this affects not just the new address masking, but also the regular valid_user_address() check used by access_ok(), and the asm version of the sign bit check in the get_user() helpers. It does not affect put_user() or clear_user() variants, since theres no speculative result to be used in a gadget for those operations.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content is related to a vulnerability fix in the Linux kernel concerning speculative execution and user address masking, which aligns with the described issue for CVE-2024-50102, which is a placeholder for a CVE description retrieval.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the way the kernel distinguishes between user-space and kernel-space addresses, particularly when using address masking and checks like `valid_user_address()`, `access_ok()`, and `get_user()`.
*   On AMD CPUs, especially prior to Zen 5, the kernel used a STAC/CLAC pair to serialize execution and prevent speculative execution leaks when accessing memory.
*   Zen 5 renamed the AC bit, which significantly improves STAC/CLAC performance but also reopens the speculation window.
*   Using just the high bit to determine user/kernel space allowed for speculative data leakage via gadgets.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Speculative Execution Vulnerability:** The primary vulnerability is that the kernelâ€™s previous methods for checking user addresses were vulnerable to speculative execution attacks. This meant that a malicious user-space program could potentially leak kernel data by carefully crafting a gadget that exploits the speculative execution window.
*   **Inadequate Address Masking:** The initial address masking implementation using only the sign bit was insufficient.
*   **Vulnerable Functions:** `valid_user_address()`, `access_ok()`, and the assembly version of sign bit checks in `get_user()` were vulnerable. `put_user()` and `clear_user()` are not affected.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Leakage:** A successful exploit could allow an attacker in user space to leak sensitive kernel data by crafting a suitable gadget for speculation.
*   The vulnerability allows for "Meltdown Lite(tm)"-like attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Speculative Execution Gadgets:** The attack relies on a malicious user-space program crafting a gadget that exploits the speculative execution of memory access checks using `valid_user_address`, `access_ok()` or `get_user()`.
*   The attack exploits the speculation window opened due to changes in how STAC/CLAC operates on Zen 5 CPUs and later.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **User-space access:** The attacker needs to be able to execute code in user space.
*   **Knowledge of speculative execution:**  The attacker needs to craft a gadget to exploit the speculative execution behavior of the affected functions.
*   **Target System:** The target system must have an affected AMD CPU, especially those of Zen 5 architecture or later.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix involves replacing the previous sign-bit based check with a comparison against a `USER_PTR_MAX` value, which is initialized at runtime.
*   The fix also updates the `mask_user_address` function to use a comparison instead of a sign extension.

This commit addresses the vulnerability by correcting the address masking logic and the related checks, preventing speculative data leaks.
