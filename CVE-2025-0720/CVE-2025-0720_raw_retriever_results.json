Affected by this issue is the function removeExtraSlashes of the file /opt/MicroWorld/sbin/rtscanner of the component Folder Watch List Handler. The manipulation leads to stack-based buffer overflow. The attack needs to be approached locally. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",
