  "description": "In version v0.3.8 of open-webui/open-webui, **improper access control** vulnerabilities allow an attacker to view any prompts. The application does not verify whether the attacker is an administrator, allowing the attacker to directly call the /api/v1/prompts/ interface to retrieve all prompt information created by the admin, which includes the ID values. Subsequently, the attacker can exploit the /api/v1/prompts/command/{command_id} interface to obtain arbitrary prompt information.",

The vulnerability involves the application not checking whether the attacker is authorized to access the prompt information. CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor is included as a secondary weakness because the lack of authorization leads to the exposure of sensitive prompt data. CWE-200 is a Class level CWE and a potential impact of CWE-862.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe200 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe862\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper access control** due to the **missing authorization** check (CWE-862). This leads to the attacker being able to view any prompts and obtain arbitrary prompt information (CWE-200).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified that the **rootcause** of the vulnerability is **improper access control**, which leads to an attacker viewing any prompts. The key phrase \"**improper access control**\" in the vulnerability description points towards an authorization issue. The retriever results listed CWE-285 Improper Authorization, CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function, and CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization as top candidates. However, after analyzing the vulnerability description and the CWE specifications, CWE-862 Missing Authorization was chosen as the primary CWE since the application does not check whether the user is authorized to access the prompt information. The access to prompt information leads to exposure of sensitive information, thus CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor is added as a secondary CWE. This assessment is based on the evidence provided in the vulnerability description. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity.\n\nCWE-285, CWE-306, and CWE-863 were considered but not used. CWE-285 is too general. CWE-306 is related to missing authentication, but the vulnerability is about missing authorization, not authentication. CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization implies that there is an authorization check, but it is flawed, which is not the case here. CWE-284 Improper Access Control was also considered, but it is a high-level category.",
