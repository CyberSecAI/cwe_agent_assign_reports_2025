## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability has been found in scipopt scip up to 9.2.1 and classified as problematic. Affected by this vulnerability is the function main of the file examples/LOP/src/genRandomLOPInstance.c of the component File Descriptor Handler. The manipulation of the argument File leads to **uncontrolled file descriptor consumption**. Local access is required to approach this attack. Upgrading to version 9.2.2 is able to address this issue. The identifier of the patch is d6da63b941216d75fbc1aefea9abf1de6712a2d0. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **uncontrolled file descriptor consumption**
- **product:** scipopt
- **version:** up to 9.2.1
- **component:** examples/LOP/src/genRandomLOPInstance.c

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Root cause of vulnerability:
The code opens a file using `fopen` but does not explicitly close it using `fclose` before the function returns. This can lead to a file descriptor leak.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Resource Leak: Specifically, a file descriptor is not released.

Impact of exploitation:
- File descriptor leak: Over time, repeatedly calling this function could exhaust available file descriptors, potentially leading to denial of service.

Attack vectors:
- Repeated execution of the `genRandomLOPInstance.c` function. No external attacker interaction is required; the vulnerability is triggered by the program's own execution.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- An attacker does not need special privileges. The vulnerability is inherent in the code itself.

Mitigation or fix:
- Add `fclose(file);` before the `return 0;` statement in the `main` function of `genRandomLOPInstance.c`. This ensures the file descriptor is released when the function completes.
