  "description": "A vulnerability has been found in scipopt scip up to 9.2.1 and classified as problematic. Affected by this vulnerability is the function main of the file examples/LOP/src/genRandomLOPInstance.c of the component File Descriptor Handler. The manipulation of the argument File leads to **uncontrolled file descriptor consumption**. Local access is required to approach this attack. Upgrading to version 9.2.2 is able to address this issue. The identifier of the patch is d6da63b941216d75fbc1aefea9abf1de6712a2d0. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component.",

This can lead to a file descriptor leak.\n\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities present:\n- Resource Leak: Specifically, a file descriptor is not released.\n\nImpact of exploitation:\n- File descriptor leak: Over time, repeatedly calling this function could exhaust available file descriptors, potentially leading to denial of service.\n\nAttack vectors:\n- Repeated execution of the `genRandomLOPInstance.c` function. No external attacker interaction is required; the vulnerability is triggered by the program's own execution.\n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position:\n- An attacker does not need special privileges. The vulnerability is inherent in the code itself.\n\nMitigation or fix:\n- Add `fclose(file);` before the `return 0;` statement in the `main` function of `genRandomLOPInstance.c`. This ensures the file descriptor is released when the function completes.",

CWE-403 is a specific type of resource leak, namely a file descriptor leak, making it a more precise but secondary classification. CWE-403 is a child of CWE-402 (Improper Shutdown), which in turn is a child of CWE-404. Because there is direct evidence of a file descriptor leak, it is appropriate to include CWE-403.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe404[\"CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\"]\n    cwe402[\"CWE-402: Improper Shutdown\"]\n    cwe403[\"CWE-403: Exposure of File Descriptor to Unintended Control Sphere ('File Descriptor Leak')\"]\n    \n    cwe402 -->|CHILDOF| cwe404\n    cwe403 -->|CHILDOF| cwe402\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe404 primary\n    class cwe403 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is simple: A file is opened but not closed (**CWE-404**), leading to a **file descriptor leak** (**CWE-403**), which can eventually lead to denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-404 (Improper Resource Shutdown or Release) because the root cause is that the file is not closed before the function returns. The more specific CWE-403 (Exposure of File Descriptor to Unintended Control Sphere ('File Descriptor Leak')) is included as a secondary classification because the resource that is leaked is explicitly a file descriptor. This is supported by the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which states that the code opens a file using `fopen` but does not explicitly close it using `fclose` before the function returns, leading to a file descriptor leak.\n\nThe retriever results also list CWE-403 and CWE-404, lending additional support to these classifications. The fix provided in the CVE description is to add `fclose(file);` before the `return 0;` statement, which aligns perfectly with fixing a resource leak.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-346: Origin Validation Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly verify that the source of data or communication is valid.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-1286: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input that is expected to be well-formed - i.e., to comply with a certain syntax - but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input complies with the syntax.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
