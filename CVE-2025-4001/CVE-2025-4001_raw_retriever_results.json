  "query": "A vulnerability has been found in scipopt scip up to 9.2.1 and classified as problematic. Affected by this vulnerability is the function main of the file examples/LOP/src/genRandomLOPInstance.c of the component File Descriptor Handler. The manipulation of the argument File leads to uncontrolled file descriptor consumption. Local access is required to approach this attack. Upgrading to version 9.2.2 is able to address this issue. The identifier of the patch is d6da63b941216d75fbc1aefea9abf1de6712a2d0. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component.",
