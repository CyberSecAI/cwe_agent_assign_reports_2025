This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of PDF-XChange Editor. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the handling of AcroForms. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated object. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.

This improper validation allows for a read past the end of an allocated object.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\\n- Out-of-bounds read vulnerability. This means the software attempts to read memory outside the boundaries of the allocated buffer or object.\\n\\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\\n- The primary impact is information disclosure. An attacker can potentially read sensitive data from the application's memory. The advisory also mentions that this could be leveraged with other vulnerabilities to achieve code execution.\\n\\n**Attack Vectors:**\\n- The attack vector involves a malicious PDF file or webpage containing specially crafted AcroForms data.\\n- User interaction is required, as the target must either open the malicious file or visit the malicious page.\\n\\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\\n- An attacker needs to be able to create a malicious PDF file or host a webpage containing malicious AcroForm data.\\n- They do not need any elevated privileges on the target system.\\n- User interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability.\\n\\n**Additional Details:**\\n- The vulnerability is fixed in version 10.4.0.388 of PDF-XChange Editor.\",

    "enhanced_query": "# Vulnerability Description\n\n    PDF-XChange Editor AcroForm **Out-Of-Bounds Read** **Information Disclosure Vulnerability**. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of PDF-XChange Editor. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the handling of AcroForms. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated object. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-25268.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'lack of proper validation of user-supplied data'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1.
