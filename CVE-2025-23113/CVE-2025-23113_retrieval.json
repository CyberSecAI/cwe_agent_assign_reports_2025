It has an action=myprojects&logout=1 **CSRF issue** in the alert-title while performing an upload of a CSV file containing a list of alert configuration. An attacker can send the victim a CSV file containing an **HTML injection** payload in the alert-title. Once the victim uploads the file, he automatically lands on a page to view the uploaded data. If the victim click on the alert-title value, it can trigger a logout request and terminates their session, or redirect to a phishing website. This vulnerability stems from the **absence of CSRF protections** on the logout functionality.', key_phrases={'rootcause': 'absence of CSRF protections', 'weakness': ['HTML injection', 'CSRF issue'],

    "enhanced_query": "# Vulnerability Description\n\n    An issue was discovered in REDCap 14.9.6. It has an action=myprojects&logout=1 **CSRF issue** in the alert-title while performing an upload of a CSV file containing a list of alert configuration. An attacker can send the victim a CSV file containing an **HTML injection** payload in the alert-title. Once the victim uploads the file, he automatically lands on a page to view the uploaded data. If the victim click on the alert-title value, it can trigger a logout request and terminates their session, or redirect to a phishing website. This vulnerability stems from the **absence of CSRF protections** on the logout functionality.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'absence of CSRF protections'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1.
