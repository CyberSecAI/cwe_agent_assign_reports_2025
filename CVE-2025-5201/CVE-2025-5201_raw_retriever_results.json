Affected is the function LWOImporterCountVertsAndFacesLWO2 of the file assimp/code/AssetLib/LWO/LWOLoader.cpp. The manipulation leads to out-of-bounds read. The attack needs to be approached locally. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The project decided to collect all Fuzzer bugs in a main-issue to address them in the future.",
