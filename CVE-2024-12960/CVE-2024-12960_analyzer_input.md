## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, has been found in 1000 Projects Portfolio Management System MCA 1.0. This issue affects some unknown processing of the file /update_edu_details.php. The manipulation of the argument q leads to **sql injection**. The attack may be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **sql injection**
- **product:** 1000 Projects Portfolio Management System
- **version:** MCA 1.0
- **component:** /update_edu_details.php

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `/update_edu_details.php` file of the "Portfolio Management System MCA Project using PHP and MySQL".
- The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization or validation of the `q` parameter before using it in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, where an attacker can inject malicious SQL code into the `q` parameter, leading to unauthorized database manipulation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Database Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database.
- **Sensitive Data Leakage:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database.
- **Data Tampering:** Attackers can modify or delete data within the database.
- **System Control:** Attackers can potentially gain comprehensive control of the system.
- **Service Interruption:** Attackers can disrupt the normal operation of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is the `q` parameter in the URL of the `/update_edu_details.php` file. The vulnerability can be triggered using an HTTP GET request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. They do not need any special privileges on the system.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious SQL injection payloads.

**Technical Details and Proof of Concept (POC):**
- The provided content gives a detailed proof of concept demonstrating various SQL injection techniques:
    - **Boolean-based blind SQL injection:**  `q=-4597' OR 3245=3245-- vObr`
    - **Time-based blind SQL injection:** `q=1' AND (SELECT 3141 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))zOPx)-- lAru`
    - **UNION query SQL injection:** `q=1' UNION ALL SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,CONCAT(0x71707a6a71,0x45494a69694f626d7a4d464a6779756c5468477a6c424550426879514c634970676e7541485a4744,0x717a707171),NULL-- -`
- It also provides the `sqlmap` command used to detect and exploit the vulnerability.

**Suggested Fixes:**
- The document suggests the following mitigation strategies:
    1. **Prepared Statements:** Use prepared statements with parameter binding to prevent SQL injection.
    2. **Input Validation:** Implement strict input validation and filtering to ensure user-provided data is in the expected format.
    3. **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits to identify and fix vulnerabilities.
