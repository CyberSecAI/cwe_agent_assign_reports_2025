# Analysis Report for CVE-2024-21519

# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-21519

## Description

This affects versions of the package opencart/opencart from 4.0.0.0. An **Arbitrary File Creation** issue was identified via the database restoration functionality. By injecting PHP code into the database, an attacker with admin privileges can create a backup file with an arbitrary filename (including the extension), within /system/storage/backup. **Note** It is less likely for the created file to be available within the web root, as part of the security recommendations for the application suggest moving the storage path outside of the web root.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Weakness:** Arbitrary File Creation
- **Impact:** create a backup file with an arbitrary filename
- **Vector:** injecting PHP code into the database
- **Attacker:** attacker with admin privileges
- **Product:** opencart/opencart
- **Version:** 4.0.0.0 and above
- **Component:** database restoration functionality

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis

The primary weakness is **CWE-434** Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type, because the attacker can upload a file with a dangerous file extension. This is enabled because of **CWE-73** External Control of File Name or Path, which allows the attacker to control the filename. The attacker requires admin privileges, so **CWE-266** Incorrect Privilege Assignment is a secondary concern, since the assignment of admin rights to a malicious actor is a prerequisite. The admin function may be missing authentication, so **CWE-306** Missing Authentication for Critical Function may be present.

## Vulnerability Chain

The vulnerability chain begins with the attacker having admin privileges (**CWE-266**), which may be due to a missing authentication (**CWE-306**). This allows the attacker to inject PHP code into the database, leading to external control of the filename (**CWE-73**). This leads to the creation of a backup file with an arbitrary filename and dangerous type (**CWE-434**), potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.

## Summary of Analysis

The primary weakness is **CWE-434** because the vulnerability description explicitly states the ability to create files with attacker-controlled names and content, and inject PHP code into the database, and later restore it as a backup file with a chosen name (e.g., `my_script.php`). This aligns with the definition of **CWE-434**.

The secondary weakness is **CWE-73** because the attacker can control the filename. This is supported by the vulnerability description, which states that the attacker can create a backup file with an arbitrary filename.

The secondary weakness **CWE-266** comes from the **attacker with admin privileges**. "When a new user registers, the system assigns them admin role due to a missing role validation." This meets the criteria to assign **CWE-266**.

The secondary weakness **CWE-306** is present because there may be a missing authentication scheme for the admin function. "Identity is never checked" This meets the criteria to assign **CWE-306**. I have low confidence here because the analysis doesn't explicitly state a missing authentication mechanism.

The retriever suggested **CWE-59** Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following'). This is not a good fit because the vulnerability does not involve symbolic links.

The retriever suggested **CWE-367** Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition. This is not a good fit because the vulnerability does not involve a race condition.

The retriever suggested **CWE-22** Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal'). This is not a good fit because the vulnerability does not involve path traversal.
