An unauthenticated attacker can inject data into outgoing emails by bypassing the extractFirstName function using a different whitespace character (e.g., \\xa0). This vulnerability can be exploited to conduct phishing attacks, damage the applications brand, cause legal and compliance issues, and result in financial impact due to unauthorized email usage.",
