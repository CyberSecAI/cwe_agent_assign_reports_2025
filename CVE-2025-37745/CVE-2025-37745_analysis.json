  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved PM hibernate Avoid deadlock in hibernate_compressor_param_set() syzbot reported a deadlock in lock_system_sleep() (see below). The **write operation to /sys/module/hibernate/parameters/compressor conflicts with the registration of ieee80211 device**, resulting in a deadlock when attempting to acquire system_transition_mutex under param_lock.
