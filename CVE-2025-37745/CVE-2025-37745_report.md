# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2025-37745

## Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved PM hibernate Avoid deadlock in hibernate_compressor_param_set() syzbot reported a deadlock in lock_system_sleep() (see below). The **write operation to /sys/module/hibernate/parameters/compressor conflicts with the registration of ieee80211 device**, resulting in a deadlock when attempting to acquire system_transition_mutex under param_lock. To avoid this deadlock, change hibernate_compressor_param_set() to use mutex_trylock() for attempting to acquire system_transition_mutex and return -EBUSY when it fails. Task flags need not be saved or adjusted before calling mutex_trylock(&system_transition_mutex) because the caller is not going to end up waiting for this mutex and if it runs concurrently with system suspend in progress, it will be frozen properly when it returns to user space. syzbot report syz-executor895/5833 is trying to acquire lock ffffffff8e0828c8 (system_transition_mutex){+.+.}-{44}, at lock_system_sleep+0x87/0xa0 kernel/power/main.c56 but task is already holding lock ffffffff8e07dc68 (param_lock){+.+.}-{44}, at kernel_param_lock kernel/params.c607 [inline] ffffffff8e07dc68 (param_lock){+.+.}-{44}, at param_attr_store+0xe6/0x300 kernel/params.c586 which lock already depends on the new lock. the existing dependency chain (in reverse order) is -> #3 (param_lock){+.+.}-{44} __mutex_lock_common kernel/locking/mutex.c585 [inline] __mutex_lock+0x19b/0xb10 kernel/locking/mutex.c730 ieee80211_rate_control_ops_get net/mac80211/rate.c220 [inline] rate_control_alloc net/mac80211/rate.c266 [inline] ieee80211_init_rate_ctrl_alg+0x18d/0x6b0 net/mac80211/rate.c1015 ieee80211_register_hw+0x20cd/0x4060 net/mac80211/main.c1531 mac80211_hwsim_new_radio+0x304e/0x54e0 drivers/net/wireless/virtual/mac80211_hwsim.c5558 init_mac80211_hwsim+0x432/0x8c0 drivers/net/wireless/virtual/mac80211_hwsim.c6910 do_one_initcall+0x128/0x700 init/main.c1257 do_initcall_level init/main.c1319 [inline] do_initcalls init/main.c1335 [inline] do_basic_setup init/main.c1354 [inline] kernel_init_freeable+0x5c7/0x900 init/main.c1568 kernel_init+0x1c/0x2b0 init/main.c1457 ret_from_fork+0x45/0x80 arch/x86/kernel/process.c148 ret_from_fork_asm+0x1a/0x30 arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S244 -> #2 (rtnl_mutex){+.+.}-{44} __mutex_lock_common kernel/locking/mutex.c585 [inline] __mutex_lock+0x19b/0xb10 kernel/locking/mutex.c730 wg_pm_notification drivers/net/wireguard/device.c80 [inline] wg_pm_notification+0x49/0x180 drivers/net/wireguard/device.c64 notifier_call_chain+0xb7/0x410 kernel/notifier.c85 notifier_call_chain_robust kernel/notifier.c120 [inline] blocking_notifier_call_chain_robust kernel/notifier.c345 [inline] blocking_notifier_call_chain_robust+0xc9/0x170 kernel/notifier.c333 pm_notifier_call_chain_robust+0x27/0x60 kernel/power/main.c102 snapshot_open+0x189/0x2b0 kernel/power/user.c77 misc_open+0x35a/0x420 drivers/char/misc.c179 chrdev_open+0x237/0x6a0 fs/char_dev.c414 do_dentry_open+0x735/0x1c40 fs/open.c956 vfs_open+0x82/0x3f0 fs/open.c1086 do_open fs/namei.c3830 [inline] path_openat+0x1e88/0x2d80 fs/namei.c3989 do_filp_open+0x20c/0x470 fs/namei.c4016 do_sys_openat2+0x17a/0x1e0 fs/open.c1428 do_sys_open fs/open.c1443 [inline] __do_sys_openat fs/open.c1459 [inline] __se_sys_openat fs/open.c1454 [inline] __x64_sys_openat+0x175/0x210 fs/open.c1454 do_syscall_x64 arch/x86/entry/common.c52 [inline] do_syscall_64+0xcd/0x250 arch/x86/entry/common.c83 entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x77/0x7f -> #1 ((pm_chain_head).rwsem){++++}-{44} down_read+0x9a/0x330 kernel/locking/rwsem.c1524 blocking_notifier_call_chain_robust kerne ---truncated---
