Although it is a Class, the retriever results suggest this or a lower level. The vulnerability involves using a **weak password** for encryption keys, making this a relevant choice. CWE-1391 is related to CWE-521 (Weak Password Requirements) via ChildOf, which could be considered if more details on specific password requirements were provided.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1391[\"CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\"]\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe521[\"CWE-521: Weak Password Requirements\"]\n\n    cwe521 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1391\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1391 primary\n    class cwe319 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **use of a weak password** (CWE-1391) for encryption keys. This leads to the potential for an attacker to decrypt the broadcasted encryption key if captured over RF. A secondary weakness is transmitting the encryption key over RF which is essentially transmitting sensitive information (encryption key) in cleartext (CWE-319). This allows decryption of all future and past messages sent via encrypted broadcast with that particular key.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is the **use of a weak password** for encryption keys. The evidence indicates that the goTenna Pro App uses a weak password for sharing encryption keys via the key broadcast method. This aligns with CWE-1391 (Use of Weak Credentials). The impact is that an attacker can decrypt broadcasted encryption keys, leading to further decryption of past and future messages. The secondary weakness is that the encryption key is essentially being transmitted in cleartext (CWE-319).\n\nThe selection of CWE-1391 is based on the vulnerability description stating \"**weak password for sharing encryption keys**\". The retriever results also list CWE-1391 as a potentially relevant CWE.\n\nCWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information) is considered a secondary weakness because the encryption key being sent is protected by a **weak password**, but the password is not strong enough. An attacker in proximity can capture the RF transmission, brute force the **weak password**, and then decrypt the messages.\n\nCWE-922 (Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information) was listed as a primary CWE for similar CVE Descriptions, however, the evidence provided is that there is a **weak password** and the encryption keys are then decrypted, not that the encryption keys are stored insecurely.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.67\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.",
