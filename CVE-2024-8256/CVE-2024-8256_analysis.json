  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-8256:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe root cause is an access control issue within the web administration interface of the Teltonika RUT240 router. Specifically, the server-side access controls for downloading troubleshooting files, system logs, and kernel logs are not properly enforced.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- **Insufficient Access Control:** Low-privileged users (specifically, users in the \"user\" group) are able to bypass intended restrictions and download sensitive system files by directly crafting GET requests or manipulating HTML.\n- **Direct Object Reference:**  The application does not properly validate user permissions before allowing access to the sensitive endpoints, `\"/api/system/troubleshoot/files/troubleshoot\"`, system log and kernel log endpoints.\n- **Information Disclosure:**  The downloaded troubleshooting file contains highly sensitive information, such as:\n    - `/etc/passwd`: Usernames which can be used in brute force attacks\n    - `/etc/uhttpd.key`: HTTPS private key, allowing decryption of network traffic\n    - `/etc/config/simcard`: SIM card PIN, allowing access to cellular service.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker with low-privileged access can obtain sensitive information, including usernames, private keys, and SIM card PIN.\n- **Privilege Escalation (Indirect):** The obtained information can potentially be used to launch further attacks, such as brute-force login attempts (using the usernames from passwd file) or decryption of traffic to intercept credentials and escalate privileges.\n- **Unauthorized SIM Card Usage:** The exposed SIM card PIN allows an attacker to use the associated cellular service without authorization.\n- **Compromised Device:** With the exposed HTTPS private key and other data, it may be possible to fully compromise the device.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- **Direct GET Requests:** An attacker can bypass UI restrictions by sending a direct GET request to the vulnerable endpoints.\n- **HTML Manipulation:** An attacker can use their browser's \"Inspect Element\" tool to modify the disabled state of the download button to enabled allowing the download.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- The attacker needs to have a low-privileged user account on the Teltonika RUT240 router's web administration interface.\n- The attacker needs basic knowledge of HTTP requests and/or familiarity with using browser developer tools.\n\n**Additional details:**\n- The vulnerability affects TSWOS firmware prior to version 1.3 and RUT2M_R_00.07.04.5 firmware prior to version 7.8.\n- The vulnerability was discovered and reported by DeepCove Cybersecurity.\n- Teltonika Networks has been notified and has issued a fix in later versions of the firmware (7.8 and later).\n\nThis detailed information goes beyond the standard CVE description by outlining specific attack vectors and the types of sensitive data exposed by the vulnerability.",
