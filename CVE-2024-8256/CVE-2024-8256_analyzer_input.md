# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-8256

## Vulnerability Description
In Teltonika Networks RUTOS devices, running on versions 7.0 to 7.8 (excluding) and TSWOS devices running on versions 1.0 to 1.3 (excluding), due to **incorrect permission handling** a vulnerability exists which allows a lower privileged user with default permissions to access critical device resources via the API.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **incorrect permission handling**
- **impact:** access critical device resources
- **vector:** API
- **attacker:** lower privileged user with default permissions
- **product:** Teltonika Networks RUTOS devices and TSWOS devices
- **version:** 7.0 to 7.8 (excluding) and 1.0 to 1.3 (excluding)

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-8256:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is an access control issue within the web administration interface of the Teltonika RUT240 router. Specifically, the server-side access controls for downloading troubleshooting files, system logs, and kernel logs are not properly enforced.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insufficient Access Control:** Low-privileged users (specifically, users in the "user" group) are able to bypass intended restrictions and download sensitive system files by directly crafting GET requests or manipulating HTML.
- **Direct Object Reference:**  The application does not properly validate user permissions before allowing access to the sensitive endpoints, `"/api/system/troubleshoot/files/troubleshoot"`, system log and kernel log endpoints.
- **Information Disclosure:**  The downloaded troubleshooting file contains highly sensitive information, such as:
    - `/etc/passwd`: Usernames which can be used in brute force attacks
    - `/etc/uhttpd.key`: HTTPS private key, allowing decryption of network traffic
    - `/etc/config/simcard`: SIM card PIN, allowing access to cellular service.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker with low-privileged access can obtain sensitive information, including usernames, private keys, and SIM card PIN.
- **Privilege Escalation (Indirect):** The obtained information can potentially be used to launch further attacks, such as brute-force login attempts (using the usernames from passwd file) or decryption of traffic to intercept credentials and escalate privileges.
- **Unauthorized SIM Card Usage:** The exposed SIM card PIN allows an attacker to use the associated cellular service without authorization.
- **Compromised Device:** With the exposed HTTPS private key and other data, it may be possible to fully compromise the device.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Direct GET Requests:** An attacker can bypass UI restrictions by sending a direct GET request to the vulnerable endpoints.
- **HTML Manipulation:** An attacker can use their browser's "Inspect Element" tool to modify the disabled state of the download button to enabled allowing the download.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have a low-privileged user account on the Teltonika RUT240 router's web administration interface.
- The attacker needs basic knowledge of HTTP requests and/or familiarity with using browser developer tools.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects TSWOS firmware prior to version 1.3 and RUT2M_R_00.07.04.5 firmware prior to version 7.8.
- The vulnerability was discovered and reported by DeepCove Cybersecurity.
- Teltonika Networks has been notified and has issued a fix in later versions of the firmware (7.8 and later).

This detailed information goes beyond the standard CVE description by outlining specific attack vectors and the types of sensitive data exposed by the vulnerability.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* 🔍 *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* 🔍 *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion – CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### 🔸 CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ✅ *“A user created with the ‘guest’ role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ✅ *“The backup service runs as root but only needs read access.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ⚠️ This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### 🔸 CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ✅ *“User can access another user’s invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.”*

## Mapping Examples – Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *“User can escalate privileges to admin.”*
> ❌ Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged – only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ✅ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**

## Good Mapping Examples – Privileges & Permissions

* ✅ **CWE-266**: *“When a new user registers, the system assigns them admin role due to a missing role validation.”*
* ✅ **CWE-250**: *“Installer runs with system-level privileges but doesn't require them to install files in the user directory.”*
* ✅ **CWE-284**: *“Inconsistent access rules between UI and backend for sensitive endpoints.”*
* ✅ **CWE-285**: *“Authorization logic fails to restrict access to finance reports based on department.”*
