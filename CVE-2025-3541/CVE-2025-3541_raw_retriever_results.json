Affected by this issue is the function FCGI_WizardProtoProcess of the file /api/wizard/getSpecs of the component HTTP POST Request Handler. The manipulation leads to command injection. The attack needs to be done within the local network. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component.",
