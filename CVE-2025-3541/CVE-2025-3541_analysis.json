  "description": "A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, has been found in H3C Magic NX15, Magic NX30 Pro, Magic NX400 and Magic R3010 up to V100R014. Affected by this issue is the function FCGI_WizardProtoProcess of the file /api/wizard/getSpecs of the component HTTP POST Request Handler. The manipulation leads to **command injection**. The attack needs to be done within the local network. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component.",

Since the vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"command injection\" and the affected component handles OS commands, CWE-78 is the more appropriate choice.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: OS Command Injection\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Command Injection\"]\n    \n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe77 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper neutralization** of special elements within an OS command, leading to the execution of unintended commands.\n\nRoot Cause: **Improper Neutralization** (CWE-78)\nImpact: Command Execution\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the vulnerability description, which explicitly mentions \"**command injection**.\" The retriever results also strongly suggest CWE-77 and CWE-78. Given the context of the affected function (HTTP POST Request Handler) and the ability to execute OS commands, CWE-78 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')) is the most accurate and specific classification.\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"The manipulation leads to **command injection**.\" This provides direct evidence for selecting CWE-78 or CWE-77. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" is NOINFO, so there is no additional information to consider.\n\nCWE-78 is at the Base level of abstraction, which is preferred. The relationship analysis confirms that CWE-78 is a child of CWE-77, making it more specific and appropriate in this context.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n*CWE-74 was considered but not selected. The reasoning is that it is a higher-level class and CWE-78 provides a more specific description of the vulnerability.*\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*CWE-80 was considered but not selected. This vulnerability is about **command injection**, not cross-site scripting.*\n\n## CWE-134: Use of Externally-Controlled Format String\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a function that accepts a format string as an argument, but the format string originates from an external source.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*CWE-134 was considered but not selected. This vulnerability is about **command injection**, not format string usage.*\n\n## CWE-790: Improper Filtering of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives data from an upstream component, but does not filter or incorrectly filters special elements before sending it to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*CWE-790 was considered but not selected. It's too general, and CWE-78 is more specific to **command injection**.*\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*CWE-116 was considered but not selected. The vulnerability is about **command injection**, not a general encoding/escaping issue.*\n\n## CWE-88: Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs a string for a command to be executed by a separate component\nin another control sphere, but it does not properly delimit the\nintended arguments, options, or switches within that command string.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*CWE-88 was considered but not selected. The vulnerability is about **command injection** in general, not specifically argument injection.*\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*CWE-1391 was considered but not selected. This is about **command injection**, not weak credentials.*\n\n## CWE-93: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses CRLF (carriage return line feeds) as a special element, e.g. to separate lines or records, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CRLF sequences from inputs.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*CWE-93 was considered but not selected. This is about **command injection**, not CRLF injection.*\n\n## CWE-294: Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA capture-replay flaw exists when the design of the product makes it possible for a malicious user to sniff network traffic and bypass authentication by replaying it to the server in question to the same effect as the original message (or with minor changes).\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*CWE-294 was considered but not selected.
