Supporting evidence includes the vulnerability description, which explicitly states **\"dynamic library injection\"** as a key aspect. The **\"absence of Hardened Runtime or Library Validation signing\"** is the root cause which has resulted in **dynamic library injection** (DYLD injection) bypassing AppleMobileFileIntegrity (AMFI). The retriever results also point to other related CWEs like CWE-426, CWE-427 related to search path issues, but these are less directly related to the core issue of process injection due to missing security features.\n\nCWE-114 is chosen since it represents the general class of \"Process Injection\".\n\nHere's how the evidence supports the selection of CWE-114 and other candidates:\n\n*   **CWE-114 (Process Injection):** The vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"dynamic library injection (DYLD injection),\" making this the most direct match.\n*   **CWE-1096 (Insufficient Isolation of System Resources):** The **absence of Hardened Runtime** can be interpreted as insufficient isolation of resources, making it a reasonable secondary consideration.\n*   **CWE-347 (Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature):** The **absence of Library Validation signing** directly relates to improper verification of cryptographic signatures.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because while a more specific CWE for DYLD injection would be ideal, none exists. CWE-114 captures the general concept, while CWE-1096 and CWE-347 capture the root causes that enabled it.\n\n**CWEs Considered But Not Used:**\n\n*   **CWE-20 Improper Input Validation:** While input validation might be a factor in some process injection scenarios, the primary cause here is the **lack of signing**, not necessarily improper input handling. Therefore, CWE-20 is not the most appropriate.\n*   **CWE-426 Untrusted Search Path & CWE-427 Uncontrolled Search Path Element:** These CWEs relate to using untrusted or uncontrolled paths to find resources. While DYLD injection *could* involve manipulating search paths, the core issue here is the **lack of validation**, not the path itself.\n\n# Relevant CWE Information:\n\n## CWE-114: Process Injection\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Description**: A process is manipulated to execute code that was not intended by the process's original developers.\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n\n## CWE-1096: Insufficient Isolation of System Resources\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Description**: The software does not adequately separate system resources so that unintended access or influence can occur.\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n\n## CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Description**: The product does not verify, or incorrectly verifies, the cryptographic signature for data.\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed",
