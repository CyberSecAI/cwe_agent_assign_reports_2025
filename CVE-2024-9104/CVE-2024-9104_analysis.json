  "description": "The UltimateAI plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to **authentication bypass** in all versions up to, and including, 2.8.3. This is due to the improper empty value check and a missing default activated value check in the ultimate_ai_change_pass function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to reset the password of the first user, whose account is not yet activated or the first user who activated their account, who are subscribers.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-9104\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n- The vulnerability stems from an improper check for empty values and a missing default activated value check within the `ultimate_ai_change_pass` function. This function is responsible for handling password changes.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Authentication Bypass:** Due to the flawed checks, an attacker can bypass the authentication process required for password changes.\n- **Improper Input Validation:** The plugin fails to adequately validate or handle empty values, allowing attackers to manipulate the password reset process.\n- **Missing Default Value Check:** The absence of a check for a default activated value allows the bypass to occur on specific user accounts.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Password Reset of First User:** An unauthenticated attacker can reset the password of:\n  - The first user whose account is not yet activated.\n  - The first user who has activated their account, provided they are subscribers.\n- **Account Takeover:** By resetting the password, attackers can gain unauthorized access to the targeted user account.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Network:** The attack is carried out remotely over the network, allowing an attacker to exploit this from anywhere without physical access.\n- **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to have any existing credentials to perform the password reset, emphasizing the severity of the vulnerability.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **No Prior Authentication:** The attacker does not require a valid account or prior authentication to exploit this vulnerability.\n- **Network Access:** The attacker needs the ability to send network requests to the vulnerable WordPress instance.\n- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Functionality:** The attacker should be aware of the existence of the `ultimate_ai_change_pass` function and its exploitable behavior.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The vulnerability affects all versions of the UltimateAI plugin up to and including version 2.8.3.\n- There is no known patch available at the time this information was released.\n- The vulnerability was reported by Istv\u00e1n M\u00e1rton of Wordfence.\n- The Wordfence article provides a CVSS score of 5.6 (Medium), indicating a moderate level of severity.",

CWE-287 is a class-level CWE that is discouraged for direct mapping when more specific options are available. The relationship indicates that if authentication is missing entirely (CWE-306), it can be considered a specific type of improper authentication (CWE-287).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    \n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe306 primary\n    class cwe287 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authentication** for the password change function (`ultimate_ai_change_pass`). Because of the **improper empty value check** and **missing default activated value check**, an unauthenticated attacker can reset the password of specific users. The root cause is the missing authentication check, leading to the impact of account takeover.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified the **authentication bypass** as a primary weakness. The retriever results highlighted CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) and CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) as potential candidates. The vulnerability description clearly states the **weakness** is due to an **improper empty value check** and **missing default activated value check** in the `ultimate_ai_change_pass` function, which allows unauthenticated attackers to reset passwords. This aligns with the definition of CWE-306 as there is no authentication required for the password reset function. The relationship analysis shows that CWE-306 is a child of CWE-287, and while CWE-287 could be considered, CWE-306 is a more specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability. I am confident in my assessment because the evidence directly supports the missing authentication aspect, and the guidance reinforces choosing the more specific base CWE when applicable.\n\nRelevant
