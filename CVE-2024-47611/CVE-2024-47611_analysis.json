  "description": "XZ Utils provide a general-purpose data-compression library plus command-line tools. When built for native Windows (MinGW-w64 or MSVC), the command line tools from XZ Utils 5.6.2 and older have a **command line argument injection** vulnerability. If a command line contains Unicode characters (for example, filenames) that dont exist in the current legacy code page, the characters are converted to similar-looking characters with best-fit mapping. Some best-fit mappings result in ASCII characters that change the meaning of the command line, which can be exploited with malicious filenames to do argument injection or **directory traversal** attacks. This vulnerability is fixed in 5.6.3. Command line tools built for Cygwin or MSYS2 are unaffected. liblzma is unaffected.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-47611:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\n- The vulnerability stems from how XZ Utils command-line tools handle Unicode characters in filenames when built for native Windows (MinGW-w64 or MSVC).\n- When a command line contains Unicode characters that are not present in the current legacy code page, these characters are converted to similar-looking characters using a \"best-fit mapping.\"\n- This best-fit mapping can, in some cases, result in ASCII characters that alter the meaning of the command line.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n- **Command Injection:**  The conversion of Unicode characters to ASCII can introduce characters like double quotes (`\"`), which can break quoting and allow for command injection.\n- **Wildcard Expansion:** The conversion of Unicode to question marks (`?`) can lead to unintended wildcard expansion, potentially including more or different files than intended.\n- **Directory Traversal:** Conversion of Unicode to forward slashes (`/`) can be used in directory traversal attacks.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n- Attackers can use malicious filenames (containing carefully crafted Unicode characters) to inject commands, leading to arbitrary code execution, or to perform directory traversal, enabling access to sensitive files or data modification.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n- Malicious filenames: An attacker can create files with Unicode characters that map to command-injection characters or wildcard/directory traversal characters when processed by the vulnerable XZ Utils command-line tools.\n- Command-line arguments: These malicious filenames are then passed to the XZ Utils command-line tools as arguments.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n- The attacker needs to be able to create files with specific Unicode characters in their filenames that will cause issues during the best-fit conversion.\n- The attacker needs to be able to pass such crafted filenames to the vulnerable XZ Utils command-line tools.\n- The attacker needs to be running on a Windows system where the legacy code page is not UTF-8, and the program is built for native Windows.\n\n**Additional details:**\n- The vulnerability is specific to command line tools built for Windows using MinGW-w64 or MSVC toolchains. Cygwin and MSYS2 builds are not affected. liblzma is also not affected.\n- The fix involves forcing the process code page to UTF-8, which prevents best-fit mapping and the resulting command injection. However, this fix is only available on Windows 10 version 1903 and later.\n- On older versions of Windows, command line tools remain vulnerable even when compiled with the fix.\n- The fix also addresses that unpaired surrogate characters will now be replaced with U+FFFD which means that those filenames become indistinguishable, but does prevent argument injection.\n\nThis information is more detailed than a typical CVE description.",

This vulnerability involves **improper neutralization of argument delimiters** in a command, leading to argument injection. The secondary weakness is CWE-23, which is a **relative path traversal**.\nCWE-88 is related to CWE-77 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command) as a child.

The secondary weakness, CWE-23, is a potential consequence of the argument injection, allowing for **directory traversal** attacks.\n\nThe evidence is strong, as the vulnerability description clearly states the **command line argument injection** and the possibility of **directory traversal** attacks due to **improper handling of Unicode characters**. The retriever results also support CWE-88 as the most relevant CWE for this vulnerability.\n\nCWE-78 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')) was considered but not selected as the primary CWE because the vulnerability is more specific to the **improper handling of argument delimiters** rather than a general OS command injection.\nCWE-22 (Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')) was considered as a potential primary CWE, but CWE-23 (Relative Path Traversal) is a more precise match since the vulnerability description explicitly mentions **directory traversal** attacks through manipulation of relative paths.\n\n# Relevant CWE Information:\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
