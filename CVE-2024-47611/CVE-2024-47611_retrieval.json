  "vulnerability_info": "VulnerabilityInfo(cve_id='CVE-2024-47611', description='XZ Utils provide a general-purpose data-compression library plus command-line tools. When built for native Windows (MinGW-w64 or MSVC), the command line tools from XZ Utils 5.6.2 and older have a **command line argument injection** vulnerability. If a command line contains Unicode characters (for example, filenames) that dont exist in the current legacy code page, the characters are converted to similar-looking characters with best-fit mapping. Some best-fit mappings result in ASCII characters that change the meaning of the command line, which can be exploited with malicious filenames to do argument injection or **directory traversal** attacks. This vulnerability is fixed in 5.6.3. Command line tools built for Cygwin or MSYS2 are unaffected. liblzma is unaffected.', key_phrases={'rootcause': 'improper handling of Unicode characters', 'weakness': ['command line argument injection', 'directory traversal'], 'impact': [\"['change the meaning of the command line'\", \"'argument injection or directory traversal']\"], 'vector': 'malicious filenames', 'attacker': '', 'product': 'XZ Utils', 'version': '5.6.2 and older', 'component': 'command line tools'}, reference_content='Based on the provided information, here\\'s an analysis of CVE-2024-47611:\\n\\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\\n\\n- The vulnerability stems from how XZ Utils command-line tools handle Unicode characters in filenames when built for native Windows (MinGW-w64 or MSVC).\\n- When a command line contains Unicode characters that are not present in the current legacy code page, these characters are converted to similar-looking characters using a \"best-fit mapping.\"\\n- This best-fit mapping can, in some cases, result in ASCII characters that alter the meaning of the command line.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\\n\\n- **Command Injection:**  The conversion of Unicode characters to ASCII can introduce characters like double quotes (`\"`), which can break quoting and allow for command injection.\\n- **Wildcard Expansion:** The conversion of Unicode to question marks (`?`) can lead to unintended wildcard expansion, potentially including more or different files than intended.\\n- **Directory Traversal:** Conversion of Unicode to forward slashes (`/`) can be used in directory traversal attacks.\\n\\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\\n\\n- Attackers can use malicious filenames (containing carefully crafted Unicode characters) to inject commands, leading to arbitrary code execution, or to perform directory traversal, enabling access to sensitive files or data modification.\\n\\n**Attack Vectors:**\\n\\n- Malicious filenames: An attacker can create files with Unicode characters that map to command-injection characters or wildcard/directory traversal characters when processed by the vulnerable XZ Utils command-line tools.\\n- Command-line arguments: These malicious filenames are then passed to the XZ Utils command-line tools as arguments.\\n\\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\\n\\n- The attacker needs to be able to create files with specific Unicode characters in their filenames that will cause issues during the best-fit conversion.\\n- The attacker needs to be able to pass such crafted filenames to the vulnerable XZ Utils command-line tools.\\n- The attacker needs to be running on a Windows system where the legacy code page is not UTF-8, and the program is built for native Windows.\\n\\n**Additional details:**\\n- The vulnerability is specific to command line tools built for Windows using MinGW-w64 or MSVC toolchains. Cygwin and MSYS2 builds are not affected. liblzma is also not affected.\\n- The fix involves forcing the process code page to UTF-8, which prevents best-fit mapping and the resulting command injection. However, this fix is only available on Windows 10 version 1903 and later.\\n- On older versions of Windows, command line tools remain vulnerable even when compiled with the fix.\\n- The fix also addresses that unpaired surrogate characters will now be replaced with U+FFFD which means that those filenames become indistinguishable, but does prevent argument injection.\\n\\nThis information is more detailed than a typical CVE description.', similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {}, 'top_cwes_by_threshold': {}}}, similarity_summary=SimilarityInsight(consensus_cwe='', top_cwes=[], confidence_levels={}, total_samples=0), analysis='', analysis_with_relationships='', criticism='', resolution='', relevant_cwes=[{'metadata': {'doc_id': '88', 'name': \"Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')\", 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product constructs a string for a command to be executed by a separate component\\nin another control sphere, but it does not properly delimit the\\nintended arguments, options, or switches within that command string.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'rootcause:improper handling of Unicode characters', 'keyphrase': 'improper handling of Unicode characters', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'weakness:command line argument injection', 'keyphrase': 'command line argument injection', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'weakness:directory traversal', 'keyphrase': 'directory traversal', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': \"impact:['change the meaning of the command line'\", 'keyphrase': \"['change the meaning of the command line'\", 'type': 'impact'}, {'id': \"impact:'argument injection or directory traversal']\", 'keyphrase': \"'argument injection or directory traversal']\", 'type': 'impact'}, {'id': 'vector:malicious filenames', 'keyphrase': 'malicious filenames', 'type': 'vector'}, {'id': 'product:XZ Utils', 'keyphrase': 'XZ Utils', 'type': 'product'}, {'id': 'version:5.6.2 and older', 'keyphrase': '5.6.2 and older', 'type': 'version'}, {'id': 'component:command line tools', 'keyphrase': 'command line tools', 'type': 'component'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(762.911971130827)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '158', 'name': 'Improper Neutralization of Null Byte or NUL Character', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes NUL characters or null bytes when they are sent to a downstream component.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'rootcause:improper handling of Unicode characters', 'keyphrase': 'improper handling of Unicode characters', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'weakness:command line argument injection', 'keyphrase': 'command line argument injection', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'weakness:directory traversal', 'keyphrase': 'directory traversal', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': \"impact:['change the meaning of the command line'\", 'keyphrase': \"['change the meaning of the command line'\", 'type': 'impact'}, {'id': \"impact:'argument injection or directory traversal']\", 'keyphrase': \"'argument injection or directory traversal']\", 'type': 'impact'}, {'id': 'vector:malicious filenames', 'keyphrase': 'malicious filenames', 'type': 'vector'}, {'id': 'product:XZ Utils', 'keyphrase': 'XZ Utils', 'type': 'product'}, {'id': 'version:5.6.2 and older', 'keyphrase': '5.6.2 and older', 'type': 'version'}, {'id': 'component:command line tools', 'keyphrase': 'command line tools', 'type': 'component'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(673.0406803844081)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '116', 'name': 'Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.

    "enhanced_query": "# Vulnerability Description\n\n    XZ Utils provide a general-purpose data-compression library plus command-line tools. When built for native Windows (MinGW-w64 or MSVC), the command line tools from XZ Utils 5.6.2 and older have a **command line argument injection** vulnerability. If a command line contains Unicode characters (for example, filenames) that dont exist in the current legacy code page, the characters are converted to similar-looking characters with best-fit mapping. Some best-fit mappings result in ASCII characters that change the meaning of the command line, which can be exploited with malicious filenames to do argument injection or **directory traversal** attacks. This vulnerability is fixed in 5.6.3. Command line tools built for Cygwin or MSYS2 are unaffected. liblzma is unaffected.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'improper handling of Unicode characters'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1.
