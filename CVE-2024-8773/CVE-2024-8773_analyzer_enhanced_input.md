## Vulnerability Description
SIMPLE.ERP client is vulnerable to **MS SQL protocol downgrade request** from a server side, what could lead to an unencrypted communication vulnerable to data interception and modification. This issue affect SIMPLE.ERP from 6.20 to 6.30. Only the 6.30 version received a patch 6.30@a03.9, which make it possible for an administrator to enforce encrypted communication. Versions 6.20 and 6.25 remain unpatched.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **MS SQL protocol downgrade request**
- **impact:** unencrypted communication vulnerable to data interception and modification
- **attacker:** server side
- **product:** SIMPLE.ERP
- **version:** 6.20 to 6.30

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2024-8773 based on provided content:

The provided content from cert.pl and simple.com.pl is relevant to CVE-2024-8773. Here's a breakdown of the information extracted:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability allows for a downgrade of the MS SQL protocol to an unencrypted form. The application accepts protocol downgrade requests originating from the server.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation ('Algorithm Downgrade') - CWE-757

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Allows for interception and modification of communication in a "Man in the middle" attack where the attacker impersonates the legitimate server.

**Attack vectors:**

*   "Man in the middle" attack.
*   Exploitation relies on the application accepting downgrade requests from the server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   Attacker needs to be in a position to intercept and modify network traffic (Man-in-the-Middle position).

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   Version 6.30 of SIMPLE.ERP addresses the vulnerability and enforces encrypted communication.
*   Versions 6.20 and 6.25 are unsupported and lack security updates.

**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**

*   The vulnerability affects SIMPLE.ERP versions from 6.20 to 6.30.
*   The vulnerability was reported to CERT Polska.
*   SIMPLE.ERP is based on SQL Server 2016, which has consistently performed well in security tests by NIST.
*   The content also mentions a second vulnerability, CVE-2024-8774, related to storing administrator passwords in a recoverable format.
