CWE-319 represents the direct consequence of this weakness, the transmission of sensitive information in cleartext. CWE-757 is a base CWE, providing a good level of detail. The relationship between CWE-757 and CWE-319 can be seen as a chain where the algorithm downgrade leads to cleartext transmission.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe757[\"CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation ('Algorithm Downgrade')\"]\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    \n    cwe757 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe319\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe757 primary\n    class cwe319 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **MS SQL protocol downgrade request** (CWE-757), leading to **unencrypted communication** (CWE-319), which then makes the system **vulnerable to data interception and modification**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is strongly based on the provided evidence, specifically the vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary.\n\nThe vulnerability description key phrases clearly indicate a \"**MS SQL protocol downgrade request**\" which aligns directly with **CWE-757 (Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation ('Algorithm Downgrade'))**. The CVE reference links content summary reinforces this by stating \"The vulnerability allows for a downgrade of the MS SQL protocol to an unencrypted form. The application accepts protocol downgrade requests originating from the server\" and explicitly mentions \"Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation ('Algorithm Downgrade') - CWE-757\".\n\nThe consequence of this downgrade is the \"**unencrypted communication vulnerable to data interception and modification**\", which aligns with **CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information)**.\n\nThe graph relationships confirm that this is a valid chain where the algorithm downgrade (CWE-757) can precede cleartext transmission (CWE-319).\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity as CWE-757 is a Base CWE and directly describes the root cause, while CWE-319 is a Base CWE and accurately describes the direct consequence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Used:* While authentication is related, the primary issue is the downgrade to a less secure algorithm, not an incorrect implementation.\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
