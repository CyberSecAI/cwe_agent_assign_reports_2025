# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-54137

## Vulnerability Description
liboqs is a C-language cryptographic library that provides implementations of post-quantum cryptography algorithms. A correctness error has been identified in the reference implementation of the HQC key encapsulation mechanism. Due to an **indexing error**, part of the secret key is incorrectly treated as non-secret data. This results in an incorrect shared secret value being returned when the decapsulation function is called with a malformed ciphertext. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.12.0.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **indexing error**
- **impact:** incorrect shared secret value
- **vector:** malformed ciphertext
- **product:** liboqs
- **version:** prior to 0.12.0
- **component:** HQC key encapsulation mechanism

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-54137:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause lies in an indexing error within the reference implementation of the HQC (Hamming Quasi-Cyclic) Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM). Specifically, during decapsulation, part of the secret key, intended to be a field called `sigma`, is incorrectly treated as part of the public key. This happens because the logic to retrieve the public key from the secret key in the decapsulation function was not updated after a `sigma` field was added to the secret key structure to enable implicit rejection of malformed ciphertexts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1.  **Incorrect Secret Key Handling:** A portion of the secret key (`sigma`) is mistakenly treated as part of the public key during decapsulation.
2.  **Flawed Comparison Check:** A faulty comparison check allows the error to propagate undetected, which causes the decapsulation function to fail to use `sigma` for implicit rejection of malformed ciphertexts.
3. **Implicit Rejection Bypass:** Due to the aforementioned errors, the decapsulation function accepts malformed ciphertexts, resulting in the generation of incorrect shared secrets.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The vulnerability causes the decapsulation function to return an incorrect shared secret when called with a malformed ciphertext. Although no concrete attack is mentioned, this mishandling of the secret key is a security vulnerability because it could potentially allow an attacker to recover the secret key or use it for other attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based (`AV:N`), meaning an attacker can be remote.
- The attack complexity is high (`AC:H`).
- No privileges are needed (`PR:N`) and no user interaction is required (`UI:N`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create a malformed ciphertext, and can do this remotely.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in versions of liboqs prior to 0.12.0, and is fixed in version 0.12.0 and later.
- The error was reported to the maintainers of the HQC reference implementation.
- The vulnerability was identified by Célian Glénaz and Dahmun Goudarzi (Quarkslab).
- The CVSS score is 7.4, indicating a high severity vulnerability.
- The vulnerability affects confidentiality and integrity, but not availability.
