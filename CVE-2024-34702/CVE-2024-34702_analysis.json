  "description": "Botan is a C++ cryptography library. X.509 certificates can identify elliptic curves using either an object identifier or using explicit encoding of the parameters. Prior to 3.5.0 and 2.19.5, checking name constraints in X.509 certificates is quadratic in the number of names and name constraints. An attacker who presented a certificate chain which contained a very large number of names in the SubjectAlternativeName, signed by a CA certificate which contained a large number of name constraints, could cause a denial of service. The problem has been addressed in Botan 3.5.0 and a partial backport has also been applied and is included in Botan 2.19.5.",

However, CWE-407 (Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity) was chosen as the primary due to the explicit mention of quadratic complexity in the vulnerability description.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe407[\"CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n\n    cwe407 -->|CAN_CAUSE| cwe400\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe407 primary\n    class cwe400 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **inefficient algorithm** (quadratic complexity) used in X.509 certificate name constraint checking.

The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms this, stating that \"The vulnerability is caused by a quadratic complexity in the name constraint checking process within X.509 certificate validation\".\n\nCWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) was considered as a secondary CWE because the **inefficient algorithm** leads to excessive resource consumption.\n\nThe selection of CWE-407 is at the Class level of abstraction, which is appropriate because there isn't a more specific Base or Variant CWE that describes quadratic complexity in certificate validation. While CWE-407 is a Class, the MITRE mapping guidance marks its Usage as \"Allowed-with-Review\", which is acceptable when a more specific CWE isn't available.
