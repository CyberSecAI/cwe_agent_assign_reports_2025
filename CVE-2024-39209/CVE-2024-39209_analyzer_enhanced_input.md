## Vulnerability Description
luci-app-sms-tool v1.9-6 was discovered to contain a **command injection** vulnerability via the score parameter.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **command injection**
- **product:** luci-app-sms-tool
- **version:** v1.9-6
- **component:** score parameter

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability lies within the `luci-app-sms-tool` plugin for OpenWrt. Specifically, the `scode` parameter in the `run_sms` request is vulnerable to command injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Command Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input in the `scode` parameter before passing it to the underlying operating system. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary OS commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the target system.
- **System Compromise:** By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can potentially gain full control of the affected device, leading to data exfiltration, malware installation, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious HTTP GET request to the `/cgi-bin/luci/admin/modem/sms/run_sms` endpoint. The `scode` parameter within the URL carries the injected command.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device, typically requiring network access to the device's web interface.
- **Authentication (potentially):** The provided example contains a `sysauth_https` cookie, suggesting that some form of authentication might be required to access the vulnerable endpoint. However, the analysis does not specify the exact authentication requirements.

**Technical Details:**

- Vulnerable parameter: `scode`
- Vulnerable endpoint: `/cgi-bin/luci/admin/modem/sms/run_sms`
- Affected product: `luci-app-sms-tool` <= 1.9-6
- Example payload: `GET /cgi-bin/luci/admin/modem/sms/run_sms?scode=12345678901234567890';%20ls%20%2F%3E%2Fwww%2Fsmstool123.txt%20#' HTTP/1.1`
- The provided exploit example shows the attacker injecting the command "`ls />/www/smstool123.txt`" which will list the files on the root directory of the server and save the output to a file in the `/www/` folder of the web server.
- The attacker is then able to access the generated file `/smstool123.txt` over http.
