  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n\n- The vulnerability lies within the `luci-app-sms-tool` plugin for OpenWrt. Specifically, the `scode` parameter in the `run_sms` request is vulnerable to command injection.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n- **Command Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input in the `scode` parameter before passing it to the underlying operating system. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary OS commands.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the target system.\n- **System Compromise:** By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can potentially gain full control of the affected device, leading to data exfiltration, malware installation, or other malicious activities.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious HTTP GET request to the `/cgi-bin/luci/admin/modem/sms/run_sms` endpoint. The `scode` parameter within the URL carries the injected command.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device, typically requiring network access to the device's web interface.\n- **Authentication (potentially):** The provided example contains a `sysauth_https` cookie, suggesting that some form of authentication might be required to access the vulnerable endpoint. However, the analysis does not specify the exact authentication requirements.\n\n**Technical Details:**\n\n- Vulnerable parameter: `scode`\n- Vulnerable endpoint: `/cgi-bin/luci/admin/modem/sms/run_sms`\n- Affected product: `luci-app-sms-tool` <= 1.9-6\n- Example payload: `GET /cgi-bin/luci/admin/modem/sms/run_sms?scode=12345678901234567890';%20ls%20%2F%3E%2Fwww%2Fsmstool123.txt%20#' HTTP/1.1`\n- The provided exploit example shows the attacker injecting the command \"`ls />/www/smstool123.txt`\" which will list the files on the root directory of the server and save the output to a file in the `/www/` folder of the web server.\n- The attacker is then able to access the generated file `/smstool123.txt` over http.",

This leads to **command injection**, where an attacker can inject arbitrary OS commands. The ultimate impact is arbitrary code execution and potential system compromise.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which provides clear evidence of a **command injection** vulnerability due to improper neutralization of special elements in the `scode` parameter. The selection of CWE-78 is strongly supported by the evidence, as it accurately describes the root cause of the vulnerability.\n\nThe `scode` parameter in the `run_sms` request is vulnerable to **command injection** because the application fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input before passing it to the underlying operating system.\n\nCWE-77 was considered, but CWE-78 is more specific because the commands are OS commands. Other CWEs like CWE-89 (SQL Injection), CWE-79 (Cross-site Scripting), CWE-94 (Code Injection), and CWE-1336 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine) were not selected because the vulnerability is specifically related to OS command injection, not SQL queries, web page generation, general code, or template engines. CWE-74 is a class-level CWE, and more specific CWEs are preferrable.",
