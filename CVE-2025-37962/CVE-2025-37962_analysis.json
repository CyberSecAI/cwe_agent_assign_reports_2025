  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ksmbd fix ****memory leak**** in parse_lease_state() The previous patch that added bounds check for create lease context introduced a ****memory leak****. When the bounds check fails, the function returns NULL without freeing the previously allocated lease_ctx_info structure. This patch fixes the issue by adding kfree(lreq) before returning NULL in both boundary check cases.",

This is an appropriate level of abstraction because the description explicitly states a **memory leak** due to the function returning NULL without freeing previously allocated memory. There are no clear parent or child relationships that would suggest a more appropriate CWE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe401[\"CWE-401: Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime\"]\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe401 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward:\n1.  A function allocates memory.\n2.  A bounds check fails.\n3.  The function returns NULL **without releasing the allocated memory**, resulting in a **memory leak**.\n\nThe root cause and impact are both encompassed by CWE-401: Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description, which clearly states that the root cause is a **memory leak** due to **missing release of memory**. The vulnerability description key phrases confirm the **memory leak**. The retriever results also list CWE-401 as the top result.
