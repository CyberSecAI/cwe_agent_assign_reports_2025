  "description": "The Loginizer Security and Loginizer plugins for WordPress are vulnerable to authentication bypass in all versions up to, and including, 1.9.2. This is due to **insufficient verification on the user being returned by the social login token**. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator, if they have access to the email and the user does not have an already-existing account for the service returning the token.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from insufficient verification of the user information returned by the social login token. Specifically, the plugin does not verify if the email address associated with a social login is verified by the provider.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Authentication Bypass:** The primary weakness is the ability for an attacker to bypass the normal authentication process.\n*   **Insufficient Verification:** The lack of verification of email verification status from the social login provider allows attackers to potentially log in as existing users.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Unauthorized Access:** An unauthenticated attacker can gain access to any existing user account on the WordPress site, including administrator accounts.\n*   **Full Site Control:** If an attacker gains access to an administrator account, they can take full control of the website, potentially leading to data breaches, malware injection, and other malicious activities.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Social Login:** The attack vector is through the social login functionality of the Loginizer plugin.\n*   **Email Address:** The attacker needs access to the email address of the target user.\n*   **Unverified Email:** The attack is possible if the user does not have an already existing account for the service returning the token and the email is not verified on the social login platform\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need to have an account on the target WordPress site.\n*   **Access to Email:** The attacker needs to know the email address of the user they intend to impersonate.\n*   **Social Login Provider:** The attacker needs to be able to authenticate through one of the configured social login providers.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n*   The vulnerability affects all versions of the \"Loginizer Security\" and \"Loginizer\" plugins up to and including version 1.9.2.\n*   The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.9.3 by adding a check to ensure the email address from the social provider is verified\n*   The vulnerability was reported by wesley (wcraft) from Wordfence.",

CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function is a child of CWE-287, but the description indicates that the social login functionality is present, but is not sufficiently validating the user information being returned. CWE-862 Missing Authorization is a peer of CWE-287, but doesn't apply because the vulnerability is happening during the authentication phase.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe862 -- PeerOf --> cwe287\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe287 primary\n    class cwe306,cwe862 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **insufficient verification on the user being returned by the social login token** (CWE-287 Improper Authentication). This leads to an **authentication bypass**, allowing an unauthenticated attacker to **log in as any existing user on the site** (impact). There are no apparent missing links in this chain.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment pointed towards authentication issues due to the **insufficient verification on the user being returned by the social login token**. The Retriever Results also highlighted CWE-287 Improper Authentication. The final decision is based on the fact that the social login process has authentication *functionality*, but the process **does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct** which maps to the CWE-287 description.\n\nThe evidence for this is:\n*   **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases:** \"**rootcause:** **insufficient verification on the user being returned by the social login token**\"\n*   **CVE Reference Links Content Summary:** \"The vulnerability stems from insufficient verification of the user information returned by the social login token. Specifically, the plugin does not verify if the email address associated with a social login is verified by the provider.\"\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the decision by showing the relationship between CWE-287 and CWE-306. However, since authentication functionality exists, but is flawed, CWE-287 is the more appropriate choice.\n\nThe selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **improper authentication** due to the **insufficient verification**.\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-472:
