# Analysis Report for CVE-2024-10097

# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-10097

## Description

The Loginizer Security and Loginizer plugins for WordPress are vulnerable to authentication bypass in all versions up to, and including, 1.9.2. This is due to **insufficient verification on the user being returned by the social login token**. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator, if they have access to the email and the user does not have an already-existing account for the service returning the token.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Rootcause:** insufficient verification on the user being returned by the social login token
- **Impact:** log in as any existing user on the site
- **Attacker:** unauthenticated attackers
- **Product:** Loginizer Security and Loginizer plugins for WordPress
- **Version:** all versions up to and including 1.9.2

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-287 | Improper Authentication | 0.9 | Class | Primary CWE | Allowed-with-Review |
| CWE-306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | 0.7 | Base | Secondary Candidate | Allowed |
| CWE-862 | Missing Authorization | 0.6 | Class | Secondary Candidate | Allowed-with-Review |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE selected is CWE-287 Improper Authentication, which is a class-level CWE. CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function is a child of CWE-287, but the description indicates that the social login functionality is present, but is not sufficiently validating the user information being returned. CWE-862 Missing Authorization is a peer of CWE-287, but doesn't apply because the vulnerability is happening during the authentication phase.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **insufficient verification on the user being returned by the social login token** (CWE-287 Improper Authentication). This leads to an **authentication bypass**, allowing an unauthenticated attacker to **log in as any existing user on the site** (impact). There are no apparent missing links in this chain.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment pointed towards authentication issues due to the **insufficient verification on the user being returned by the social login token**. The Retriever Results also highlighted CWE-287 Improper Authentication. The final decision is based on the fact that the social login process has authentication *functionality*, but the process **does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct** which maps to the CWE-287 description.

The evidence for this is:
*   **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases:** "**rootcause:** **insufficient verification on the user being returned by the social login token**"
*   **CVE Reference Links Content Summary:** "The vulnerability stems from insufficient verification of the user information returned by the social login token. Specifically, the plugin does not verify if the email address associated with a social login is verified by the provider."

The graph relationships influenced the decision by showing the relationship between CWE-287 and CWE-306. However, since authentication functionality exists, but is flawed, CWE-287 is the more appropriate choice.

The selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **improper authentication** due to the **insufficient verification**.

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-178: Improper Handling of Case Sensitivity
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense
