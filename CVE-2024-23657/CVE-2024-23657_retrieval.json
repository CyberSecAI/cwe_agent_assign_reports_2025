  "vulnerability_info": "VulnerabilityInfo(cve_id='CVE-2024-23657', description='Nuxt is a free and open-source framework to create full-stack web applications and websites with Vue.js. Nuxt Devtools is ****missing authentication**** on the `getTextAssetContent` RPC function which is vulnerable to **path traversal**. Combined with a lack of Origin checks on the WebSocket handler, an attacker is able to interact with a locally running devtools instance and exfiltrate data abusing this vulnerability. In certain configurations an attacker could leak the devtools authentication token and then abuse other RPC functions to achieve RCE. The `getTextAssetContent` function does not check for **path traversal**s, this could allow an attacker to read arbitrary files over the RPC WebSocket. The WebSocket server does not check the origin of the request leading to cross-site-websocket-hijacking. This may be intentional to allow certain configurations to work correctly. Nuxt Devtools authentication tokens are placed within the home directory of the current user. The malicious webpage can connect to the Devtools WebSocket, perform a **directory traversal** brute force to find the authentication token, then use the *authenticated* `writeStaticAssets` function to create a new Component, Nitro Handler or `app.vue` file which will run automatically as the file is changed. This vulnerability has been addressed in release version 1.3.9. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.', key_phrases={'rootcause': 'missing authentication', 'weakness': ['directory traversal', 'missing authentication', 'path traversal'], 'impact': ['arbitrary file write', 'exfiltrate data', 'read arbitrary files'], 'vector': '', 'attacker': 'attacker', 'product': 'Nuxt Devtools', 'version': '', 'component': 'getTextAssetContent RPC function'}, reference_content=\"Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-23657:\\n\\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\\n\\nThe vulnerability stems from two main issues within the Nuxt Devtools:\\n\\n1.  **Path Traversal in `getTextAssetContent`:** The `getTextAssetContent` RPC function in `assets.ts` does not properly sanitize or validate file paths, allowing an attacker to use path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) to read arbitrary files on the server.\\n2.  **Missing Origin Check on WebSocket:** The WebSocket handler in `index.ts` lacks proper origin checks, enabling Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH). This allows a malicious website to connect to the devtools' WebSocket server.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\\n\\n*   **Path Traversal (CWE-24):** The `getTextAssetContent` function is vulnerable to path traversal, enabling arbitrary file reading.\\n*   **Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH):** Due to the lack of origin checks, an attacker can establish a WebSocket connection from a different domain.\\n*   **Insecure Storage of Authentication Token:** Devtools authentication tokens are stored in the user's home directory.\\n\\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\\n\\n*   **Arbitrary File Read:** Attackers can read arbitrary files on the user's system, including sensitive files containing secrets or configuration details.\\n*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In specific configurations, if the attacker can obtain the Devtools authentication token via directory traversal, they can use the `writeStaticAssets` function to create a new component, Nitro handler or `app.vue` file which will automatically run when the file is changed, leading to RCE.\\n\\n**Attack Vectors:**\\n\\n1.  An attacker hosts a malicious webpage.\\n2.  A user with a vulnerable Nuxt project (with Devtools enabled) visits the malicious page.\\n3.  The malicious page connects to the user's local Devtools WebSocket server.\\n4.  The attacker exploits the path traversal vulnerability in `getTextAssetContent` to read the Devtools authentication token from the user's home directory.\\n5.  The attacker leverages the token to use the `writeStaticAssets` function to create a malicious file, achieving RCE.\\n\\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\\n\\n*   The attacker needs to host a malicious website accessible to the victim user.\\n*   The victim user needs to have a vulnerable Nuxt project running with Devtools enabled.\\n*   The victim user needs to have authenticated with devtools at least once, to generate the auth token in their home directory\\n*   The vulnerable project needs to be placed within the users home directory for the directory traversal to find the authentication token.\\n*  The attacker needs knowledge of the Devtools RPC protocol to interact with the WebSocket server and exploit the vulnerabilities.\\n\\n**Additional Details (beyond the CVE description):**\\n\\n*   The provided content includes the vulnerable code snippets, showcasing the lack of path sanitization in `getTextAssetContent` and the missing origin check in the WebSocket connection handler.\\n*   It provides a Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrating the exploit, including steps for setting up the vulnerable environment and using the exploit page.\\n*   The content emphasizes that all new Nuxt projects are vulnerable by default due to Devtools being enabled.\\n*  The content shows the location of the authentication token in the user's home directory, which is a key step for the RCE portion of the exploit.\", similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {},

    "enhanced_query": "# Vulnerability Description\n\n    Nuxt is a free and open-source framework to create full-stack web applications and websites with Vue.js. Nuxt Devtools is ****missing authentication**** on the `getTextAssetContent` RPC function which is vulnerable to **path traversal**. Combined with a lack of Origin checks on the WebSocket handler, an attacker is able to interact with a locally running devtools instance and exfiltrate data abusing this vulnerability. In certain configurations an attacker could leak the devtools authentication token and then abuse other RPC functions to achieve RCE. The `getTextAssetContent` function does not check for **path traversal**s, this could allow an attacker to read arbitrary files over the RPC WebSocket. The WebSocket server does not check the origin of the request leading to cross-site-websocket-hijacking. This may be intentional to allow certain configurations to work correctly. Nuxt Devtools authentication tokens are placed within the home directory of the current user. The malicious webpage can connect to the Devtools WebSocket, perform a **directory traversal** brute force to find the authentication token, then use the *authenticated* `writeStaticAssets` function to create a new Component, Nitro Handler or `app.vue` file which will run automatically as the file is changed. This vulnerability has been addressed in release version 1.3.9. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'missing authentication'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1.
