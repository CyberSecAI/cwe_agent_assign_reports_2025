2025-07-13 19:42:55 | INFO     | Keyphrases - Rootcause: The commit 504fc6f4f7f681d2a03aa5f68aad549d90eab853 removed the protection of disabling softirqs when calling rcu_read_lock_bh() in VRF. This caused a lockdep warning because dev_queue_xmit_nit is expected to be called with BH disabled., Weakness: The commit removed a necessary protection (disabling softirqs) before calling rcu_read_lock_bh() in the VRF implementation, leading to a race condition.
