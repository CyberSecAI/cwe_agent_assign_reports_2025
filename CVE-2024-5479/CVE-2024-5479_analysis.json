  "description": "The Easy Pixels plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via plugin settings in all versions up to, and including, 2.13 due to **insufficient input sanitization and output escaping**. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",

  "reference_content": "### CVE-2024-5479\nBased on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe root cause is insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the Easy Pixels plugin's settings.\n\n**Vulnerabilities:**\n- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when saving plugin settings. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts that are then stored in the database and executed in a user's browser when they view the affected page.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of a user's browser.\n- **Malicious Actions:** This can lead to a wide range of malicious activities, including:\n    - Redirecting users to malicious sites.\n    - Stealing user session cookies.\n    - Defacing website content.\n    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- The primary attack vector is through the plugin's settings. An unauthenticated attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the plugin settings (e.g., tracking codes) via a POST request that updates the plugin options.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.\n- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n- The vulnerability is present in all versions of the Easy Pixels plugin up to and including version 2.13.\n- The plugin's admin settings page at `/admin/easyPixelsAdmin.php` and the main plugin file `easyPixels.php` are implicated as the areas where the unsanitized input is handled.\n- The plugin settings are stored in the database without proper sanitization.\n- The vulnerability is triggered when the stored malicious scripts are rendered on a page, affecting any user who visits the injected page.\n- There is no known patch available, and the suggested remediation is to uninstall the plugin.",

The vulnerability description clearly states that the plugin is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. |\n| CWE-116 | Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output | 0.7 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary Candidate. The description mentions \"insufficient output escaping\" which directly relates to improper encoding or escaping of output. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship influencing the decision is the direct mapping of **insufficient input sanitization and output escaping** to CWE-79 and CWE-116 respectively. CWE-79 is a Base level CWE, providing sufficient specificity for the vulnerability. CWE-116 is a Class level CWE and may have more specific Base-level children that would be more appropriate, but without more information, it is difficult to determine a better fit.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe116[\"CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\"]\n    \n    cwe116 -->|CHILDOF| cwe138[\"CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe79 primary\n    class cwe116 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **insufficient input sanitization and output escaping**, leading to Stored Cross-Site Scripting. The attacker injects arbitrary web scripts into the plugin settings, which are then stored in the database without proper sanitization. When a user accesses the injected page, the malicious scripts are executed in their browser.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is primarily based on the provided evidence, specifically the vulnerability description and the CVE reference summary. The description explicitly states that the plugin is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting due to **insufficient input sanitization and output escaping**. This aligns directly with CWE-79, which addresses the improper neutralization of input during web page generation.\n\nThe selection of CWE-79 as the primary CWE is based on the direct match with the vulnerability description and the CVE reference summary. The weakness is the **insufficient input sanitization and output escaping** which results in XSS.\n\nCWE-116 was considered due to the \"insufficient output escaping\" component of the root cause.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-79 being a Base level CWE and CWE-116 being a Class level CWE.
