Prior to commit c4f81d9616d40c60584e36abb15300853a66e489, the `url` variable on line 63 of `pages/9__Vector_Data_Visualization.py` takes user input, which is later passed to the `gpd.read_file` method. `gpd.read_file` method creates a request to arbitrary destinations, leading to blind server-side request forgery. Commit c4f81d9616d40c60584e36abb15300853a66e489 fixes this issue.",
