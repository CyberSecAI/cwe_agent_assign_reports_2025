  "description": "A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, has been found in 1000 Projects Beauty Parlour Management System 1.0. This issue affects some unknown processing of the file /admin/admin-profile.php. The manipulation of the argument adminname leads to **sql injection**. The attack may be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n- The root cause of the SQL injection vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization or validation of the `adminname` parameter in the `/admin/admin-profile.php` file. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code through this parameter.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- SQL Injection: The primary vulnerability is an SQL injection flaw. The application directly uses user-supplied input within an SQL query without any prior sanitization, allowing manipulation of the query.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- Unauthorized Database Access: Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database.\n- Sensitive Data Leakage: Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database.\n- Data Tampering: Attackers can modify or delete data within the database.\n- System Control: Attackers can gain comprehensive control over the system.\n- Service Interruption: Attackers can potentially cause a denial-of-service by disrupting the database or system.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- HTTP POST Request: The vulnerability is exploited via an HTTP POST request to the `/admin/admin-profile.php` file.\n- Malicious Parameter: The attacker injects malicious SQL code through the `adminname` parameter.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- No login required: The attacker does not need to be logged in or authorized to exploit the vulnerability.\n- Network access: The attacker needs network access to send the crafted HTTP POST request to the vulnerable web application.\n\n**Technical Details:**\n- Vulnerable Parameter: `adminname` (POST parameter).\n- Vulnerable File: `/admin/admin-profile.php`.\n- Example Payload:\n    - `adminname=miral' WHERE 5186=5186 AND 1779=(SELECT (CASE WHEN (1779=1779) THEN 1779 ELSE (SELECT 2512 UNION SELECT 5931) END))-- -` (boolean-based blind SQLi)\n    - `adminname=miral' WHERE 3702=3702 AND (SELECT 5784 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))QZUE)-- YQpv` (time-based blind SQLi)\n- The provided `sqlmap` command demonstrates how the vulnerability can be automatically exploited using a SQL injection testing tool.\n- The vulnerability exists in version V1.0 of the software.\n- The software can be downloaded from `https://1000projects.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Beauty-Parlour-Management-System.7z`\n\n**Mitigation:**\nThe following mitigation strategies are suggested:\n1.  Use prepared statements with parameter binding to prevent SQL injection.\n2.  Implement strict input validation and filtering of user-provided data.\n3.  Minimize database user permissions and avoid using highly privileged accounts.\n4.  Conduct regular security audits to detect and fix vulnerabilities.\n\nThe provided information gives more detail than a typical CVE description.",
