Further analysis recognized the lack of authentication as a contributing factor (CWE-306).\n\nThe selection of CWE-22 is at the appropriate level of specificity as it directly describes the path traversal **weakness**. CWE-20, while relevant as a broader category, is too general and discouraged.\n\nThe evidence is not strong as the CVE Reference Links Content Summary is \"UNRELATED\".\n\nRelevant CWE
