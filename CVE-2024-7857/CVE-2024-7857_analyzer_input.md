# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-7857

## Vulnerability Description
The Media Library Folders plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to second order SQL Injection via the sort_type parameter of the mlf_change_sort_type AJAX action in all versions up to, and including, 8.2.2 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**
- **weakness:** **second order SQL injection**
- **impact:** extract sensitive information from the database and information disclosure
- **attacker:** authenticated attackers
- **product:** Media Library Folders plugin for WordPress
- **version:** all versions up to and including 8.2.2
- **component:** mlf_change_sort_type AJAX action

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the CVE-2024-7857 vulnerability:

**1. Verification:**

The content relates to CVE-2024-7857, as the vulnerability is described as a second-order SQL injection in the Media Library Folders plugin, and the provided Wordfence article explicitly identifies the vulnerability and the affected versions as the ones in the provided documents.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization and escaping of user-supplied input in the `sort_type` parameter of the `mlf_change_sort_type` AJAX action. The plugin fails to adequately prepare the existing SQL query, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL commands. Specifically, the `sort_type` parameter is directly inserted into the `ORDER BY` clause of the SQL query without sufficient sanitization and validation.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Second-Order SQL Injection:** The vulnerability is a second-order SQL Injection, meaning that an attacker injects malicious SQL code which is then stored, and then later executed by the application.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The plugin does not properly escape or validate the `sort_type` parameter before incorporating it into the SQL query.
*   **Lack of Prepared Statements:** The SQL query is not adequately prepared, allowing direct injection of user-supplied input into the query string.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to extract sensitive information from the WordPress database, potentially including user credentials and other confidential data.
*   **Data Modification/Deletion:** In certain scenarios, an attacker might be able to modify or delete existing data in the database, leading to data integrity issues.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** Depending on the database user permissions, an attacker might be able to gain broader control over the database server and potentially the system.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **AJAX Request:** The attack vector involves sending a crafted AJAX request to the `mlf_change_sort_type` action. The request should contain a malicious SQL payload in the `sort_type` parameter.
*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker must be authenticated to access the affected AJAX endpoint, but only requires subscriber level access or higher.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have at least a subscriber-level account on the target WordPress site.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send requests to the vulnerable WordPress site's AJAX endpoint.
*   **Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs some familiarity with SQL to craft effective injection payloads.

**Additional Details (beyond official CVE description):**

*   The Wordfence article provides more technical details than a standard CVE, including specific file paths related to the vulnerable code within the plugin.
*  The Trac changeset details how the issue was patched, by implementing the function `validate_sort_type` to sanitize the sort type parameter before using it in SQL queries.
*   The Wordfence article provides the specific version range affected by the vulnerability.
*   The Trac changeset includes additional validation changes, notably for validating the order by parameter, with a new function `validateOrderBy`, and sanitizing the table names using `sanitize_text_field`.
