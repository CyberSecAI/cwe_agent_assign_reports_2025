The vulnerability description explicitly mentions **prototype pollution**, and the CVE reference links content summary confirms that the vulnerability is due to the lack of proper input validation, allowing an attacker to manipulate the global prototype chain. The retriever results also list CWE-1321 as the top candidate.\n\nThe selection of CWE-1321 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **improperly controlled modification of object prototype attributes**.
