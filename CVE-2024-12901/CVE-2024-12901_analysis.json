The description explicitly mentions the **improper authorization** when the password argument is manipulated.\n\nThe selection of CWE-285 is primarily driven by the explicit mention of **improper authorization** in the vulnerability description. The CWE guidance also suggests using CWE-285 for general or ambiguous authorization failures.\n\nThe provided evidence strongly supports the **improper authorization** classification, even though the exact nature of the authorization flaw remains unclear.
