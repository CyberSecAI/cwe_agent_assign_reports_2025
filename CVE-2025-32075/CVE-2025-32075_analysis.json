  "reference_content": "## CVE-2025-32075 Analysis\n\nThis content is directly related to CVE-2025-32075. It provides significantly more detail than a standard CVE description.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\n*   CSS injection in system message tabs-dropdown-bgcolor due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input.\n*   IP address and user agent leaks when rendering standalone tabs and regular tabs, stemming from issues within the `Tabs.php` file.\n*   IP + User agent leak in the CSS sanitisation function.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   CSS Injection\n*   Information Leakage (IP address and User-Agent)\n*   Insufficient input sanitization\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   **CSS Injection:** An attacker can inject malicious CSS code, potentially altering the appearance and functionality of the page, and potentially leading to phishing or other attacks.\n*   **Information Leakage:** Exposure of user IP addresses and User-Agent strings, compromising user privacy.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Setting a malicious message containing CSS code in the `tabs-dropdown-bgcolor` parameter.\n*   Rendering a tab with a specific container configuration that triggers the IP/User-Agent leak.\n*   Crafting a tab style attribute that bypasses CSS sanitization.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   Ability to control the content of messages or tab configurations.\n*   No authentication is required to trigger the information leak.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   The vulnerability was addressed by a patch set (changes 1121573, 1121581, 1121582, 1121583, 1121584) that includes sanitization improvements to prevent CSS injection and address the IP/User-Agent leakage issues.\n*   The patch was merged into the `master`, `REL1_39`, `REL1_41`, `REL1_42`, and `REL1_43` branches of the `mediawiki/extensions/Tabs` repository.\n*   The task was marked as resolved and the fix has been deployed.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n*   The vulnerable code is located in `includes/Tabs.php` within the `mediawiki/extensions/Tabs` extension. Specific lines mentioned are 420, 212, 279, and 372.\n*   Screenshots are provided demonstrating the CSS injection and information leakage.\n*   Gerrit links are provided for the relevant code changes and patch sets.\n*   The risk rating is assessed as Medium.",

Because the input isn't validated, this leads to **Code Injection** (CWE-94).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description indicates an **Improper Input Validation vulnerability** that allows **Code Injection**. I am basing my assessment primarily on the explicit mention of these weaknesses in the vulnerability description.\n\nThe primary CWE is CWE-20, **Improper Input Validation**, as it is the root cause of the vulnerability. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions this weakness: \"**Improper Input Validation vulnerability** in The Wikimedia Foundation Mediawiki - Tabs Extension allows Code Injection.\"\n\nCWE-94, **Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')**, is identified as a secondary CWE because it is the direct result of the **improper input validation**. The vulnerability description states that the **improper input validation** \"allows Code Injection,\" indicating a direct causal relationship.\n\nCWE-79, **Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')**, was considered but not selected. While XSS is a common result of **improper input validation**, the description specifically mentions **Code Injection**, which is a more precise impact.\n\nI am overriding the general mapping guidance that discourages the use of CWE-20 because in this case the description explicitly calls out **Improper Input Validation** as the rootcause. I am being specific by identifying Code Injection as the result.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).

This is often a component in phishing attacks.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names. The associated manipulations are intended to generate multiple names for the same object.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 2837.24\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
