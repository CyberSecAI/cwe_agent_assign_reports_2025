# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-22032
## Query
A vulnerability has been identified in which an RKE1 cluster keeps constantly reconciling when secrets encryption configuration is enabled. When reconciling, the Kube API secret values are written in plaintext on the AppliedSpec. Cluster owners, Cluster members, and Project members (for projects within the cluster), all have RBAC permissions to view the cluster object from the apiserver.

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: 'Kube API secret values written in plaintext on AppliedSpec'
