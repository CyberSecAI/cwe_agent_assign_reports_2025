## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability has been identified in which an RKE1 cluster keeps constantly reconciling when secrets encryption configuration is enabled. When reconciling, the Kube API secret values are written in plaintext on the AppliedSpec. Cluster owners, Cluster members, and Project members (for projects within the cluster), all have RBAC permissions to view the cluster object from the apiserver.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **Kube API secret values written in plaintext on AppliedSpec**
- **impact:** view cluster object from apiserver
- **attacker:** Cluster owners and Cluster members and Project members
- **product:** RKE1 cluster

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-22032:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from how RKE1 clusters handle secrets encryption configurations. Specifically, when secrets encryption is enabled, the Kube API secret values are written in plaintext within the `AppliedSpec` of the cluster object. This occurs during the reconciliation process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Plaintext Storage of Secrets:** Sensitive data, specifically the secrets encryption configuration, including the encryption keys themselves, are stored in plaintext within the cluster's `AppliedSpec`.
- **Inadequate Data Handling:** The system doesn't properly sanitize or remove sensitive information from the `AppliedSpec` during reconciliation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unauthorized Access to Encryption Keys:** Attackers with sufficient RBAC permissions can access the cluster object and view the plaintext encryption keys stored in the `AppliedSpec`.
- **Compromise of Secrets Encryption:** By obtaining the encryption keys, an attacker can potentially decrypt all secrets in the affected cluster. This could lead to a full cluster compromise.
- **Data Breach:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data within the Kubernetes cluster can lead to data breaches.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network Access:** Attackers must have network access to the Kubernetes API server.
- **RBAC Access:** Attackers need to have at least "low" privileges as Cluster owners, Cluster members, or Project members to view cluster object.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** Ability to communicate with the Kubernetes API server.
- **RBAC Permissions:**  Must possess RBAC permissions that allow them to view cluster objects. This includes Cluster owners, Cluster members, and Project members (within the cluster).

**Additional Notes:**

- **Specific to RKE1:** This vulnerability only affects clusters provisioned using RKE1 with secrets encryption enabled.
- **No Workarounds:** There are no workarounds available; users must upgrade to patched versions.
- **Manual Key Rotation:** The vulnerability requires users to manually rotate keys by editing the cluster.

**Patches:**

- The vulnerability is addressed in Rancher versions `2.7.14` and `2.8.5`. The fix involves copying the `AppliedSpec` before mutation to ensure sensitive data is removed during reconciliation.

**CWEs:**

- CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor
- CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of Passwords

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* 🔍 *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* 🔍 *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion – CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### 🔸 CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ✅ *“A user created with the ‘guest’ role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ✅ *“The backup service runs as root but only needs read access.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ⚠️ This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### 🔸 CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ✅ *“User can access another user’s invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.”*

## Mapping Examples – Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *“User can escalate privileges to admin.”*
> ❌ Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged – only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ✅ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**

| “Unauthorized read/write to file”           | Permission control issue              | CWE-285                                      |
| “Can access resource without correct role”  | Incorrect or missing permission check | CWE-285, 862, 863                            |

## Good Mapping Examples – Privileges & Permissions

* ✅ **CWE-266**: *“When a new user registers, the system assigns them admin role due to a missing role validation.”*
* ✅ **CWE-250**: *“Installer runs with system-level privileges but doesn't require them to install files in the user directory.”*
* ✅ **CWE-284**: *“Inconsistent access rules between UI and backend for sensitive endpoints.”*
* ✅ **CWE-285**: *“Authorization logic fails to restrict access to finance reports based on department.”*
