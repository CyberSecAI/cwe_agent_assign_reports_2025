  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-22032:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\n- The vulnerability stems from how RKE1 clusters handle secrets encryption configurations. Specifically, when secrets encryption is enabled, the Kube API secret values are written in plaintext within the `AppliedSpec` of the cluster object. This occurs during the reconciliation process.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n- **Plaintext Storage of Secrets:** Sensitive data, specifically the secrets encryption configuration, including the encryption keys themselves, are stored in plaintext within the cluster's `AppliedSpec`.\n- **Inadequate Data Handling:** The system doesn't properly sanitize or remove sensitive information from the `AppliedSpec` during reconciliation.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n- **Unauthorized Access to Encryption Keys:** Attackers with sufficient RBAC permissions can access the cluster object and view the plaintext encryption keys stored in the `AppliedSpec`.\n- **Compromise of Secrets Encryption:** By obtaining the encryption keys, an attacker can potentially decrypt all secrets in the affected cluster. This could lead to a full cluster compromise.\n- **Data Breach:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data within the Kubernetes cluster can lead to data breaches.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n- **Network Access:** Attackers must have network access to the Kubernetes API server.\n- **RBAC Access:** Attackers need to have at least \"low\" privileges as Cluster owners, Cluster members, or Project members to view cluster object.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n- **Network Access:** Ability to communicate with the Kubernetes API server.\n- **RBAC Permissions:**  Must possess RBAC permissions that allow them to view cluster objects. This includes Cluster owners, Cluster members, and Project members (within the cluster).\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n- **Specific to RKE1:** This vulnerability only affects clusters provisioned using RKE1 with secrets encryption enabled.\n- **No Workarounds:** There are no workarounds available; users must upgrade to patched versions.\n- **Manual Key Rotation:** The vulnerability requires users to manually rotate keys by editing the cluster.\n\n**Patches:**\n\n- The vulnerability is addressed in Rancher versions `2.7.14` and `2.8.5`. The fix involves copying the `AppliedSpec` before mutation to ensure sensitive data is removed during reconciliation.\n\n**CWEs:**\n\n- CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n- CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of Passwords",

CWE-312 is chosen as the most specific base CWE that directly addresses the root cause of storing secrets in plaintext. CWE-200 is a parent of CWE-532 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File) and is a more general form of information exposure. CWE-863 is a class-level CWE related to authorization issues.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe532[\"CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File\"]\n    \n    cwe312 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe532 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe942[\"CWE-942: Permissive Cross-domain Policy with Untrusted Domains\"]\n    cwe942 -->|CHILDOF| cwe863\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe312 primary\n    class cwe200,cwe863 secondary\n    class cwe532 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **Kube API secret values written in plaintext on AppliedSpec** (CWE-312). The ability for Cluster owners, Cluster members, and Project members to **view cluster object from apiserver** (CWE-200) represents the exposure of that sensitive information to unauthorized actors. Finally, if authorization checks were improperly performed or missing (CWE-863), this could exacerbate the issue.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nBased on the provided evidence, the primary weakness is the **Kube API secret values written in plaintext on AppliedSpec**. This leads to exposure of sensitive information. The analysis relies heavily on the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" and the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary,\" which clearly indicate the root cause and impact.\n\nThe selection of CWE-312 is justified by the direct evidence of plaintext storage of secrets. CWE-200 is included as a secondary weakness because the plaintext secrets are accessible, leading to potential unauthorized exposure. The inclusion of CWE-863 is more speculative but plausible since access control vulnerabilities could contribute to the overall risk.\n\nThe abstraction level is optimized by selecting CWE-312 as the base CWE, providing the most specific description of the root cause. CWE-200 is also a base CWE related to the impact.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\nThis is about using privileges to do unsafe actions.
