Verification:**\\n\\nThe content from security.paloaltonetworks.com directly addresses CVE-2025-0131, detailing a vulnerability in the OPSWAT MetaDefender Endpoint Security SDK used by the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app. The other two sources are related to Palo Alto Networks but do not contain specific vulnerability information.\\n\\n**2. Extracted Information (from security.paloaltonetworks.com):**\\n\\n*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Incorrect privilege management in the OPSWAT MetaDefender Endpoint Security SDK.\\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment, CAPEC-233 Privilege Escalation.\\n*   **Impact of exploitation:** A locally authenticated, non-administrative Windows user can escalate their privileges to NT AUTHORITY\\\\SYSTEM.\\n*   **Attack vectors:** Local. Requires a race condition to be successfully exploited, making it difficult.\\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Locally authenticated Windows user (non-administrative). Must also be able to exploit a race condition.\\n*   **Mitigation or fix:**\\n    *   Upgrade MetaDefender Endpoint Security SDK to version 4.3.4451 or later on Windows.\\n    *   Upgrade GlobalProtect App to:\\n        *   6.3.3 or later (GlobalProtect App 6.3 on Windows)\\n        *   6.2.8 or later (GlobalProtect App 6.2 on Windows)\\n        *   6.2.8 or 6.3.3 or later (GlobalProtect App 6.1 & 6.0 on Windows)\\n\\n**3. Additional Details:**\\n\\n*   **Exploit Maturity:** UNREPORTED - No known malicious exploitation.\\n*   **CVSS-BT:** 4.0 / CVSS-B: 7.1 (CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:P/PR:L/UI:N/VC:N/VI:H/VA:N/SC:H/SI:H/SA:H/E:U/AU:N/R:U/V:D/U:Amber)\\n*   **Discovered:** Externally.\\n*   **Acknowledgments:**  Maxime Escourbiac, Michelin CERT, Yassine Bengana, Abicom for Michelin CERT, and Sandro Poppi for discovering and reporting the issue.
