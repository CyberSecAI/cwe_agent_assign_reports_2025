# Retrieval Query for CVE-2025-0131

# Vulnerability Description

    An **incorrect privilege management** vulnerability in the OPSWAT MetaDefender Endpoint Security SDK used by the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app on Windows devices allows a locally authenticated non-administrative Windows user to escalate their privileges to NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM. However, execution requires that the local user also successfully exploits a **race condition**, which makes this vulnerability difficult to exploit.
