Affected by this issue is some unknown functionality of the file /api/wizard/getWifiNeighbour of the component HTTP POST Request Handler. The manipulation leads to command injection. The attack needs to be initiated within the local network. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component.",
