# Retrieval Query for CVE-2024-13676

# Vulnerability Description

    The Categorized Gallery Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to **SQL Injection** via the field attribute of the image_gallery shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 2.0 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.
