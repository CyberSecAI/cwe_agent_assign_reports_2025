This affects the function run_single of the file factool/factool/math/tool.py. The manipulation leads to code injection. The attack needs to be approached locally. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. This product takes the approach of rolling releases to provide continious delivery. Therefore, version details for affected and updated releases are not available.",
