  "reference_content": "Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2024-29085:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\n*   Improper access control in some BigDL software maintained by Intel.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   The primary vulnerability is related to improper access control. This means that the software does not correctly restrict access to certain functionalities or resources based on user roles or privileges.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   Escalation of Privilege: An authenticated user could potentially elevate their access level to perform actions they are not authorized for.\n*   The document states that this vulnerability may enable an authenticated user to potentially escalate privileges via adjacent access.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   Adjacent access is required, meaning the attacker needs to be on the same network or have some form of local access.\n*   The attacker must be an authenticated user of the BigDL software.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   The attacker must have valid credentials to log into the affected BigDL software.\n*   The attacker must have adjacent access (same network or local) to the affected system.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n*   The vulnerability is present in BigDL software versions prior to 2.5.0.\n*   The severity of the vulnerability is rated as \"Medium\".\n*   The vulnerability was reported by houjingyi.\n*   Intel recommends updating to version 2.5.0 or later to mitigate the issue.\n\nThis document provides more detail than a basic CVE description, detailing the attack vector (adjacent access), required authentication, and specific impact of privilege escalation.",
