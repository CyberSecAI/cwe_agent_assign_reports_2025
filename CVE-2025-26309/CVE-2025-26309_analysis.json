  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-26309 Content\n\nThe provided content details a memory leak vulnerability in the `parseSWF_DEFINESCENEANDFRAMEDATA` function of libming version 0.4.8. This directly relates to a potential CVE as it describes a security weakness.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe `parseSWF_DEFINESCENEANDFRAMEDATA` function allocates memory for `Scenes` and `Frames` arrays using `malloc` but does not deallocate this memory, leading to memory leaks.  The `readString` function called within loops also contributes to memory leaks as its allocated memory is not freed.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Memory Leak: Failure to free allocated memory.\n*   Lack of Deallocation: Missing `free()` calls for allocated structures.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nRepeated parsing of SWF files could lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition due to excessive memory consumption.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Providing a specially crafted SWF file to libming for parsing.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   An attacker needs to be able to provide a SWF file to the application using libming. No special privileges are required.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\nThe vulnerability can be fixed by adding `free()` calls to deallocate the memory allocated for `parserrec->Scenes` and `parserrec->Frames` before the function returns. Additionally, the memory allocated by `readString` should be freed.\n\n**More detail than official CVE description:**\n\nYes, the content provides significantly more detail than a typical CVE description. It includes:\n\n*   Specific function name and line numbers where the vulnerability exists.\n*   ASAN (AddressSanitizer) output demonstrating the memory leaks.\n*   A proof-of-concept (PoC) file.\n*   Code snippets illustrating the allocation without deallocation.\n*   Detailed explanation of the root cause and impact.",

There are several other related CWEs, such as CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) and CWE-789 (Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value). However, given the specific description of a **memory leak** due to failure to release allocated memory, CWE-401 is the most accurate and specific representation of the vulnerability's root cause. Other CWEs like CWE-770 and CWE-789, while related to resource allocation, do not directly address the issue of memory not being released after use.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe401[\"CWE-401: Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe789[\"CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\"]\n    cwe476[\"CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference\"]\n    \n    cwe401\n    cwe789 -->|CHILDOF| cwe770\n    cwe789 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe476\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe401 primary\n    class cwe770,cwe789,cwe476 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **memory leak** in the `parseSWF_DEFINESCENEANDFRAMEDATA` function (CWE-401). The failure to release allocated memory leads to excessive memory consumption, eventually resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, which includes the vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary. The key phrases from the description highlight the **memory leak** as the root cause. The CVE reference details the function `parseSWF_DEFINESCENEANDFRAMEDATA`'s allocation of memory without subsequent deallocation. The retriever results also prioritize CWE-401. Therefore, CWE-401 is the most suitable CWE to represent this vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-401: Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently track and release allocated memory after it has been used, which slowly consumes remaining memory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product dereferences a pointer that it expects to be valid but is NULL.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-126: Buffer Over-read\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations after the targeted buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-909: Missing Initialization of Resource\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not initialize a critical resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-788: Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads or writes to a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location after the end of the buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: The CWE entry might be misused when lower-level CWE entries might be available.
