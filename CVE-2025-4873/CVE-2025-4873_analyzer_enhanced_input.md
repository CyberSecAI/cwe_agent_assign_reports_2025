## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
```
Root cause of vulnerability:
* A SQL injection vulnerability was identified within the "/admin/index.php" file of the "News Portal" project. The root cause lies in the fact that attackers can inject malicious code via the parameter "username". This input is then directly utilized in SQL queries without undergoing proper sanitization or validation processes. As a result, attackers are able to fabricate input values, manipulate SQL queries, and execute unauthorized operations.

Impact of exploitation:
* Exploiting this SQL injection vulnerability allows attackers to gain unauthorized access to the database, cause sensitive data leakage, tamper with data, gain complete control over the system, and even disrupt services. This poses a severe threat to both the security of the system and the continuity of business operations.

Attack vectors:
* The "username" parameter in "/admin/index.php" can be used in a POST request to inject malicious SQL queries.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
* No login or authorization is required to exploit this vulnerability

Vulnerability details and POC:
*   Vulnerability location: "username" parameter
*   Payload examples are provided for boolean-based blind, error-based, and time-based blind SQL injection attacks.
*   A sample request packet is provided.

Suggested repair:
*   Employ prepared statements and parameter binding.
*   Conduct input validation and filtering.
*   Minimize database user permissions.

More detail than the official CVE description:
*   Provides specific details about the affected file, version, and the vulnerable parameter.
*   Includes example payloads and request packets for exploitation.
*   Outlines the root cause and impact of the vulnerability in detail.
