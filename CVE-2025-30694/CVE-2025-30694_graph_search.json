Easily exploitable vulnerability allows low privileged attacker having User Account privilege with network access via HTTP to compromise XML Database. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in XML Database, attacks may significantly impact additional products (scope change). Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of XML Database accessible data as well as unauthorized read access to a subset of XML Database accessible data.
