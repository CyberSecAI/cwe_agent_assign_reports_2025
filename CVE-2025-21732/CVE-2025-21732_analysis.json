  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved RDMA/mlx5 Fix a race for an ODP MR which leads to CQE with error This patch addresses a ****race condition** for an ODP MR** that can result in a CQE with an error on the UMR QP. During the __mlx5_ib_dereg_mr() flow, the following sequence of calls occurs mlx5_revoke_mr() mlx5r_umr_revoke_mr() mlx5r_umr_post_send_wait() At this point, the lkey is freed from the hardwares perspective. However, concurrently, mlx5_ib_invalidate_range() might be triggered by another task attempting to invalidate a range for the same freed lkey. This task will - Acquire the umem_odp->umem_mutex lock. - Call mlx5r_umr_update_xlt() on the UMR QP. - Since the lkey has already been freed, this can lead to a CQE error, causing the UMR QP to enter an error state [1]. To resolve this **race condition**, the umem_odp->umem_mutex lock is now also acquired as part of the mlx5_revoke_mr() scope. Upon successful revoke, we set umem_odp->private which points to that MR to NULL, preventing any further invalidation attempts on its lkey.

While it's generally preferred to map to Base or Variant level CWEs, the description of the vulnerability clearly points to a **race condition** without specifying a more precise type of concurrency issue. Therefore, CWE-362 is the most appropriate choice given the available information.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    \n    class cwe362 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is as follows:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Race condition** in RDMA/mlx5 driver during ODP MR deregistration (**CWE-362**)\n2.  The **race condition** occurs between `mlx5_revoke_mr()` and `mlx5_ib_invalidate_range()`.\n3.

The **race condition** leads to a CQE error and puts the UMR QP into an error state.\n\nThe primary indicator for a **race condition** is the concurrent execution of `mlx5_revoke_mr()` and `mlx5_ib_invalidate_range()` on the same `lkey`. The premature freeing of the `lkey` before the invalidation attempt is complete causes the error. The fix implemented involves acquiring a mutex lock to prevent concurrent access to the `lkey` during the revocation process.\n\nThe Retriever Results also support this assessment, with CWE-362 having the highest score.\n\nI considered other CWEs such as CWE-367 (Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) **Race Condition**) and CWE-366 (**Race Condition** within a Thread), but CWE-362 is more general and accurately describes the overall problem. It is not a TOCTOU vulnerability, because it does not involve a check then use scenario. Also, the description doesn't specify the **race condition** is specifically within a single thread.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check.
