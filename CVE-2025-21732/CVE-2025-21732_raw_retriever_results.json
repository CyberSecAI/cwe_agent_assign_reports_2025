  "query": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved RDMA/mlx5 Fix a race for an ODP MR which leads to CQE with error This patch addresses a race condition for an ODP MR that can result in a CQE with an error on the UMR QP. During the __mlx5_ib_dereg_mr() flow, the following sequence of calls occurs mlx5_revoke_mr() mlx5r_umr_revoke_mr() mlx5r_umr_post_send_wait() At this point, the lkey is freed from the hardwares perspective. However, concurrently, mlx5_ib_invalidate_range() might be triggered by another task attempting to invalidate a range for the same freed lkey. This task will - Acquire the umem_odp->umem_mutex lock. - Call mlx5r_umr_update_xlt() on the UMR QP. - Since the lkey has already been freed, this can lead to a CQE error, causing the UMR QP to enter an error state [1]. To resolve this race condition, the umem_odp->umem_mutex lock is now also acquired as part of the mlx5_revoke_mr() scope. Upon successful revoke, we set umem_odp->private which points to that MR to NULL, preventing any further invalidation attempts on its lkey.
