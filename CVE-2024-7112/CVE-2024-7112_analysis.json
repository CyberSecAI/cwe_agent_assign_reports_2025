  "description": "The Pinpoint Booking System - #1 WordPress Booking Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the schedule parameter in all versions up to, and including, 2.9.9.5.0 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.",

  "reference_content": "### Summary:\nThe provided content relates to **CVE-2024-7112**, a SQL Injection vulnerability in the Pinpoint Booking System WordPress plugin.\n\n**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient escaping of the user-supplied `schedule` parameter in the `set` function, leading to the injection of arbitrary SQL code into a query.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n*   **SQL Injection:** The plugin does not properly sanitize or parameterize user input before using it in an SQL query, making it susceptible to SQL injection attacks.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n*   **Data Breach:** Attackers can extract sensitive data from the database.\n*   **Data Modification:** Attackers could potentially alter or delete data in the database.\n*   **Privilege Escalation:** In some scenarios, attackers could potentially gain elevated privileges.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n*   The vulnerability is triggered through an AJAX request to the `set` function within the `class-backend-calendar-schedule.php` file.\n*   The `schedule` POST parameter is the point of injection.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated with at least subscriber-level access.\n*   **Network Access:** The attack is performed over the network.\n\n**Technical Details:**\n* The vulnerable code resides within the `set` function of `includes/calendars/class-backend-calendar-schedule.php`, specifically around lines 441-547, where the `schedule` POST parameter is processed and used in SQL queries without proper sanitization.\n* The `Wordfence` article points to the specific lines of code in the file.\n*   The vulnerability was patched in version 2.9.9.5.1 of the Pinpoint Booking System plugin.",

Although CWE-74 exists, CWE-89 is the more specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability. There are no identified chain relationships that are relevant in this case.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    \n    cwe89 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe89 primary\n    class cwe74 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**, leading to **SQL injection**, which allows authenticated attackers to extract sensitive information from the database.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly points towards CWE-89 as the primary weakness. The vulnerability description clearly states **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**, which directly leads to **SQL injection**. The CVE reference links content summary reinforces this by stating that the root cause is insufficient escaping of the user-supplied `schedule` parameter, leading to the injection of arbitrary SQL code. The retriever results also list CWE-89 as the top candidate.\n\nI considered CWE-74, but it is a more general \"Injection\" class, and CWE-89 is a more specific and accurate description of the vulnerability.
