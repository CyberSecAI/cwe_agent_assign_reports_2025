## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
### Summary:
The provided content relates to **CVE-2024-7112**, a SQL Injection vulnerability in the Pinpoint Booking System WordPress plugin.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient escaping of the user-supplied `schedule` parameter in the `set` function, leading to the injection of arbitrary SQL code into a query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The plugin does not properly sanitize or parameterize user input before using it in an SQL query, making it susceptible to SQL injection attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Breach:** Attackers can extract sensitive data from the database.
*   **Data Modification:** Attackers could potentially alter or delete data in the database.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** In some scenarios, attackers could potentially gain elevated privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is triggered through an AJAX request to the `set` function within the `class-backend-calendar-schedule.php` file.
*   The `schedule` POST parameter is the point of injection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated with at least subscriber-level access.
*   **Network Access:** The attack is performed over the network.

**Technical Details:**
* The vulnerable code resides within the `set` function of `includes/calendars/class-backend-calendar-schedule.php`, specifically around lines 441-547, where the `schedule` POST parameter is processed and used in SQL queries without proper sanitization.
* The `Wordfence` article points to the specific lines of code in the file.
*   The vulnerability was patched in version 2.9.9.5.1 of the Pinpoint Booking System plugin.
