It is possible to define an entity by providing a substitution string in the form of a URI. The XML parser can access the contents of this URI and embed these contents back into the XML document for further processing.\n\n\nBy submitting an XML file that defines an external entity with a file:// URI, an attacker can cause the processing application to read the contents of a local file. For example, a URI such as \"file:///c:/winnt/win.ini\" designates (in Windows) the file C:\\Winnt\\win.ini, or file:///etc/passwd designates the password file in Unix-based systems. Using URIs with other schemes such as http://, the attacker can force the application to make outgoing requests to servers that the attacker cannot reach directly, which can be used to bypass firewall restrictions or hide the source of attacks such as port scanning.\n\n\nOnce the content of the URI is read, it is fed back into the application that is processing the XML. This application may echo back the data (e.g. in an error message), thereby exposing the file contents.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-42745: Recruiter software allows reading arbitrary files using XXE\n\n- CVE-2005-1306: A browser control can allow remote attackers to determine the existence of files via Javascript containing XML script.\n\n- CVE-2012-5656: XXE during SVG image conversion\n\n- CVE-2012-2239: XXE in PHP application allows reading the application's configuration file.\n\n- CVE-2012-3489: XXE in database server\n\n- CVE-2012-4399: XXE in rapid web application development framework allows reading arbitrary files.\n\n- CVE-2012-3363: XXE via XML-RPC request.\n\n- CVE-2012-0037: XXE in office document product using RDF.\n\n- CVE-2011-4107: XXE in web-based administration tool for database.\n\n- CVE-2010-3322: XXE in product that performs large-scale data analysis.\n\n- CVE-2009-1699: XXE in XSL stylesheet functionality in a common library used by some web browsers.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-25817: SilverStripe through 4.6.0-rc1 has an XXE Vulnerability in CSSContentParser. A developer utility meant for parsing HTML within unit tests can be vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks. When this developer utility is misused for purposes involving external or user submitted data in custom project code, it can lead to vulnerabilities such as XSS on HTML output rendered through this custom code. This is now mitigated by disabling external entities during parsing. (The correct CVE ID year is 2020 [CVE-2020-25817, not CVE-2021-25817]).\n\n- CVE-2021-20453: IBM WebSphere Application Server 8.0, 8.5, and 9.0 is vulnerable to a XML External Entity Injection (XXE) attack when processing XML data.

CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).\n\n- CVE-2021-27635: SAP NetWeaver AS for JAVA, versions - 7.20, 7.30, 7.31, 7.40, 7.50, allows an attacker authenticated as an administrator to connect over a network and submit a specially crafted XML file in the application because of missing XML Validation, this vulnerability enables attacker to fully compromise confidentiality by allowing them to read any file on the filesystem or fully compromise availability by causing the system to crash. The attack cannot be used to change any data so that there is no compromise as to integrity.\n\n- CVE-2021-32925: admin/user_import.php in Chamilo 1.11.x reads XML data without disabling the ability to load external entities.\n\n- CVE-2021-44145: In the TransformXML processor of Apache NiFi before 1.15.1 an authenticated user could configure an XSLT file which, if it included malicious external entity calls, may reveal sensitive information.\n\n- CVE-2021-42560: An issue was discovered in CALDERA 2.9.0. The Debrief plugin receives base64 encoded \"SVG\" parameters when generating a PDF document. These SVG documents are parsed in an unsafe manner and can be leveraged for XXE attacks (e.g., File Exfiltration, Server Side Request Forgery, Out of Band Exfiltration, etc.).\n\n- CVE-2022-23170: SysAid - Okta SSO integration - was found vulnerable to XML External Entity Injection vulnerability. Any SysAid environment that uses the Okta SSO integration might be vulnerable. An unauthenticated attacker could exploit the XXE vulnerability by sending a malformed POST request to the identity provider endpoint. An attacker can extract the identity provider endpoint by decoding the SAMLRequest parameter's value and searching for the AssertionConsumerServiceURL parameter's value. It often allows an attacker to view files on the application server filesystem and interact with any back-end or external systems that the application can access. In some situations, an attacker can escalate an XXE attack to compromise the underlying server or other back-end infrastructure by leveraging the XXE vulnerability to perform server-side request forgery (SSRF) attacks.\n\n- CVE-2022-24449: Solar appScreener through 3.10.4, when a valid license is not present, allows XXE and SSRF attacks via a crafted XML document.\n\n- CVE-2022-2458: XML external entity injection(XXE) is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with an application's processing of XML data. This attack occurs when XML input containing a reference to an external entity is processed by a weakly configured XML parser. The software processes an XML document that can contain XML entities with URIs that resolve to documents outside of the intended sphere of control, causing the product to embed incorrect documents into its output. Here, XML external entity injection lead to External Service interaction & Internal file read in Business Central and also Kie-Server APIs.\n\n- CVE-2022-27193: CVRF-CSAF-Converter before 1.0.0-rc2 resolves XML External Entities (XXE). This leads to the inclusion of arbitrary (local) file content into the generated output document. An attacker can exploit this to disclose information from the system running the converter.\n\n- CVE-2022-3338: An External XML entity (XXE) vulnerability in ePO prior to 5.10 Update 14 can lead to an unauthenticated remote attacker to potentially trigger a Server Side Request Forgery attack. This can be exploited by mimicking the Agent Handler call to ePO and passing the carefully constructed XML file through the API.\n\n- CVE-2022-35741: Apache CloudStack version 4.5.0 and later has a SAML 2.0 authentication Service Provider plugin which is found to be vulnerable to XML external entity (XXE) injection. This plugin is not enabled by default and the attacker would require that this plugin be enabled to exploit the vulnerability. When the SAML 2.0 plugin is enabled in affected versions of Apache CloudStack could potentially allow the exploitation of XXE vulnerabilities. The SAML 2.0 messages constructed during the authentication flow in Apache CloudStack are XML-based and the XML data is parsed by various standard libraries that are now understood to be vulnerable to XXE injection attacks such as arbitrary file reading, possible denial of service, server-side request forgery (SSRF) on the CloudStack management server.\n\n- CVE-2022-38342: Safe Software FME Server v2021.2.5, v2022.0.0.2 and below was discovered to contain a XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability which allows authenticated attackers to perform data exfiltration or Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks.\n\n- CVE-2022-3980: An XML External Entity (XEE) vulnerability allows server-side request forgery (SSRF) and potential code execution in Sophos Mobile managed on-premises between versions 5.0.0 and 9.7.4.\n\n- CVE-2022-42745: CandidATS version 3.0.0 allows an external attacker to read arbitrary files from the server.

          "matched_text": "CWE-941: Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel\n\nType: Base\n\nStatus: Incomplete\n\nDescription:\n\nThe product creates a communication channel to initiate an outgoing request to an actor, but it does not correctly specify the intended destination for that actor.\n\nExtended Details:\n\n\n\nAttackers at the destination may be able to spoof trusted servers to steal data or cause a denial of service.\n\n\nThere are at least two distinct weaknesses that can cause the product to communicate with an unintended destination:\n\n\n  - If the product allows an attacker to control which destination is specified, then the attacker can cause it to connect to an untrusted or malicious destination. For example, because UDP is a connectionless protocol, UDP packets can be spoofed by specifying a false source address in the packet; when the server receives the packet and sends a reply, it will specify a destination by using the source of the incoming packet - i.e., the false source. The server can then be tricked into sending traffic to the wrong host, which is effective for hiding the real source of an attack and for conducting a distributed denial of service (DDoS). As another example, server-side request forgery (SSRF) and XML External Entity (XXE) can be used to trick a server into making outgoing requests to hosts that cannot be directly accessed by the attacker due to firewall restrictions.\n\n  - If the product incorrectly specifies the destination, then an attacker who can control this destination might be able to spoof trusted servers. While the most common occurrence is likely due to misconfiguration by an administrator, this can be resultant from other weaknesses. For example, the product might incorrectly parse an e-mail or IP address and send sensitive data to an unintended destination. As another example, an Android application may use a \"sticky broadcast\" to communicate with a receiver for a particular application, but since sticky broadcasts can be processed by *any* receiver, this can allow a malicious application to access restricted data that was only intended for a different application.\n\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2013-5211: composite: NTP feature generates large responses (high amplification factor) with spoofed UDP source addresses.\n\n- CVE-1999-0513: Classic \"Smurf\" attack, using spoofed ICMP packets to broadcast addresses.\n\n- CVE-1999-1379: DNS query with spoofed source address causes more traffic to be returned to spoofed address than was sent by the attacker.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-0590: In sendNetworkConditionsBroadcast of NetworkMonitor.java, there is a possible way for a privileged app to receive WiFi BSSID and SSID without location permissions due to a missing permission check. This could lead to local information disclosure with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-10 Android-11 Android-8.1 Android-9Android ID: A-175213041\n\n- CVE-2021-25755: In JetBrains Code With Me before 2020.3, an attacker on the local network, knowing a session ID, could get access to the encrypted traffic.\n\n- CVE-2021-0480: In createPendingIntent of SnoozeHelper.java, there is a possible broadcast intent containing a sensitive identifier. This could lead to local information disclosure with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-10 Android-11 Android-8.1 Android-9Android ID: A-174493336\n\n- CVE-2021-44225: In Keepalived through 2.2.4, the D-Bus policy does not sufficiently restrict the message destination, allowing any user to inspect and manipulate any property. This leads to access-control bypass in some situations in which an unrelated D-Bus system service has a settable (writable) property\n\n- CVE-2021-45884: In Brave Desktop 1.17 through 1.33 before 1.33.106, when CNAME-based adblocking and a proxying extension with a SOCKS fallback are enabled, additional DNS requests are issued outside of the proxying extension using the system's DNS settings, resulting in information disclosure. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2021-21323 and CVE-2021-22916.\n\n- CVE-2022-21671: @replit/crosis is a JavaScript client that speaks Replit's container protocol. A vulnerability that involves exposure of sensitive information exists in versions prior to 7.3.1. When using this library as a way to programmatically communicate with Replit in a standalone fashion, if there are multiple failed attempts to contact Replit through a WebSocket, the library will attempt to communicate using a fallback poll-based proxy. The URL of the proxy has changed, so any communication done to the previous URL could potentially reach a server that is outside of Replit's control and the token used to connect to the Repl could be obtained by an attacker, leading to full compromise of that Repl (not of the account). This was patched in version 7.3.1 by updating the address of the fallback WebSocket polling proxy to the new one. As a workaround, a user may specify the new address for the polling host (`gp-v2.replit.com`) in the `ConnectArgs`. More information about this workaround is available in the GitHub Security Advisory.\n\n- CVE-2022-21673: Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. In affected versions when a data source has the Forward OAuth Identity feature enabled, sending a query to that datasource with an API token (and no other user credentials) will forward the OAuth Identity of the most recently logged-in user. This can allow API token holders to retrieve data for which they may not have intended access. This attack relies on the Grafana instance having data sources that support the Forward OAuth Identity feature, the Grafana instance having a data source with the Forward OAuth Identity feature toggled on, the Grafana instance having OAuth enabled, and the Grafana instance having usable API keys. This issue has been patched in versions 7.5.13 and 8.3.4.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-923 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-406 (CanPrecede)",

A remote attacker can trick the victim to follow a specially crafted link and execute arbitrary HTML and script code in user's browser in context of vulnerable website to steal potentially sensitive information, change appearance of the web page, can perform phishing and drive-by-download attacks.\n\n- CVE-2022-36325: Affected devices do not properly sanitize data introduced by an user when rendering the web interface. This could allow an authenticated remote attacker with administrative privileges to inject code and lead to a DOM-based XSS.\n\n- CVE-2022-4029: The Simple:Press plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the 'sforum_[md5 hash of the WordPress URL]' cookie value in versions up to, and including, 6.8 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link. This would be highly complex to exploit as it would require the attacker to set the cookie a cookie for the targeted user.\n\n- CVE-2022-24720: image_processing is an image processing wrapper for libvips and ImageMagick/GraphicsMagick.

The issue is unbounded, attacker controlled stack growth which will at some point lead to a stack overflow and a process crash. This issue has been fixed in version 4.61.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-31099: rulex is a new, portable, regular expression language. When parsing untrusted rulex expressions, the stack may overflow, possibly enabling a Denial of Service attack. This happens when parsing an expression with several hundred levels of nesting, causing the process to abort immediately. This is a security concern for you, if your service parses untrusted rulex expressions (expressions provided by an untrusted user), and your service becomes unavailable when the process running rulex aborts due to a stack overflow. The crash is fixed in version **0.4.3**. Affected users are advised to update to this version. There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-3216: A vulnerability has been found in Nintendo Game Boy Color and classified as problematic. This vulnerability affects unknown code of the component Mobile Adapter GB. The manipulation leads to memory corruption. The attack can be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. VDB-208606 is the identifier assigned to this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2022-38334: XPDF v4.04 and earlier was discovered to contain a stack overflow via the function Catalog::countPageTree() at Catalog.cc.\n\n- CVE-2022-41966: XStream serializes Java objects to XML and back again. Versions prior to 1.4.20 may allow a remote attacker to terminate the application with a stack overflow error, resulting in a denial of service only via manipulation the processed input stream. The attack uses the hash code implementation for collections and maps to force recursive hash calculation causing a stack overflow. This issue is patched in version 1.4.20 which handles the stack overflow and raises an InputManipulationException instead. A potential workaround for users who only use HashMap or HashSet and whose XML refers these only as default map or set, is to change the default implementation of java.util.Map and java.util per the code example in the referenced advisory. However, this implies that your application does not care about the implementation of the map and all elements are comparable.\n\n- CVE-2022-47662: GPAC MP4Box 2.1-DEV-rev649-ga8f438d20 has a segment fault (/stack overflow) due to infinite recursion in Media_GetSample isomedia/media.c:662\n\n- CVE-2022-23460: Jsonxx or Json++ is a JSON parser, writer and reader written in C++. In affected versions of jsonxx json parsing may lead to stack exhaustion in an address sanitized (ASAN) build. This issue may lead to Denial of Service if the program using the jsonxx library crashes. This issue exists on the current commit of the jsonxx project and the project itself has been archived. Updates are not expected. Users are advised to find a replacement.\n\n- CVE-2022-23606: Envoy is an open source edge and service proxy, designed for cloud-native applications. When a cluster is deleted via Cluster Discovery Service (CDS) all idle connections established to endpoints in that cluster are disconnected. A recursion was introduced in the procedure of disconnecting idle connections that can lead to stack exhaustion and abnormal process termination when a cluster has a large number of idle connections. This infinite recursion causes Envoy to crash. Users are advised to upgrade.\n\n- CVE-2022-24921: regexp.Compile in Go before 1.16.15 and 1.17.x before 1.17.8 allows stack exhaustion via a deeply nested expression.\n\n- CVE-2022-25313: In Expat (aka libexpat) before 2.4.5, an attacker can trigger stack exhaustion in build_model via a large nesting depth in the DTD element.\n\n- CVE-2022-27810: It was possible to trigger an infinite recursion condition in the error handler when Hermes executed specific maliciously formed JavaScript. This condition was only possible to trigger in dev-mode (when asserts were enabled). This issue affects Hermes versions prior to v0.12.0.\n\n- CVE-2022-28201: An issue was discovered in MediaWiki before 1.35.6, 1.36.x before 1.36.4, and 1.37.x before 1.37.2. Users with the editinterface permission can trigger infinite recursion, because a bare local interwiki is mishandled for the mainpage message.\n\n- CVE-2022-28773: Due to an uncontrolled recursion in SAP Web Dispatcher and SAP Internet Communication Manager, the application may crash, leading to denial of service, but can be restarted automatically. \n\n- CVE-2022-31173: Juniper is a GraphQL server library for Rust. Affected versions of Juniper are vulnerable to uncontrolled recursion resulting in a program crash. This issue has been addressed in version 0.15.10. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should limit the recursion depth manually.\n\n- CVE-2022-37315: graphql-go (aka GraphQL for Go) through 0.8.0 has infinite recursion in the type definition parser.\n\n- CVE-2022-41881: Netty project is an event-driven asynchronous network application framework. In versions prior to 4.1.86.Final, a StackOverflowError can be raised when parsing a malformed crafted message due to an infinite recursion. This issue is patched in version 4.1.86.Final. There is no workaround, except using a custom HaProxyMessageDecoder.\n\n- CVE-2022-27943: libiberty/rust-demangle.c in GNU GCC 11.2 allows stack consumption in demangle_const, as demonstrated by nm-new.\n\n- CVE-2022-40150: Those using Jettison to parse untrusted XML or JSON data may be vulnerable to Denial of Service attacks (DOS). If the parser is running on user supplied input, an attacker may supply content that causes the parser to crash by Out of memory. This effect may support a denial of service attack.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-834 (ChildOf)",

Web applications often mistakenly make the assumption that data passed to the client in hidden fields or cookies is not susceptible to tampering. Improper validation of data that are user-controllable can lead to the application processing incorrect, and often malicious, input.\n\n\nFor example, custom cookies commonly store session data or persistent data across sessions. This kind of session data is normally involved in security related decisions on the server side, such as user authentication and access control. Thus, the cookies might contain sensitive data such as user credentials and privileges. This is a dangerous practice, as it can often lead to improper reliance on the value of the client-provided cookie by the server side application.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2002-0108: Forum product allows spoofed messages of other users via hidden form fields for name and e-mail address.\n\n- CVE-2000-0253: Shopping cart allows price modification via hidden form field.\n\n- CVE-2000-0254: Shopping cart allows price modification via hidden form field.\n\n- CVE-2000-0926: Shopping cart allows price modification via hidden form field.\n\n- CVE-2000-0101: Shopping cart allows price modification via hidden form field.\n\n- CVE-2000-0102: Shopping cart allows price modification via hidden form field.\n\n- CVE-2000-0758: Allows admin access by modifying value of form field.\n\n- CVE-2002-1880: Read messages by modifying message ID parameter.\n\n- CVE-2000-1234: Send email to arbitrary users by modifying email parameter.\n\n- CVE-2005-1652: Authentication bypass by setting a parameter.\n\n- CVE-2005-1784: Product does not check authorization for configuration change admin script, leading to password theft via modified e-mail address field.\n\n- CVE-2005-2314: Logic error leads to password disclosure.\n\n- CVE-2005-1682: Modification of message number parameter allows attackers to read other people's messages.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-35324: A vulnerability in the Form_Login function of TOTOLINK A720R A720R_Firmware V4.1.5cu.470_B20200911 allows attackers to bypass authentication.\n\n- CVE-2021-36383: Xen Orchestra (with xo-web through 5.80.0 and xo-server through 5.84.0) mishandles authorization, as demonstrated by modified WebSocket resourceSet.getAll data is which the attacker changes the permission field from none to admin.

This causes the product to appear to be the source of the request, leading it to act as a proxy or other intermediary between the upstream component and the external actor.\n\nExtended Details:\n\n\n\nIf an attacker cannot directly contact a target, but the product has access to the target, then the attacker can send a request to the product and have it be forwarded to the target. The request would appear to be coming from the product's system, not the attacker's system. As a result, the attacker can bypass access controls (such as firewalls) or hide the source of malicious requests, since the requests would not be coming directly from the attacker.\n\n\nSince proxy functionality and message-forwarding often serve a legitimate purpose, this issue only becomes a vulnerability when:\n\n\n  - The product runs with different privileges or on a different system, or otherwise has different levels of access than the upstream component;\n\n  - The attacker is prevented from making the request directly to the target; and\n\n  - The attacker can create a request that the proxy does not explicitly intend to be forwarded on the behalf of the requester. Such a request might point to an unexpected hostname, port number, hardware IP, or service. Or, the request might be sent to an allowed service, but the request could contain disallowed directives, commands, or resources.\n\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-1999-0017: FTP bounce attack.

BLS signature validation in lotus uses blst library method VerifyCompressed. This method accepts signatures in 2 forms: \"serialized\", and \"compressed\", meaning that BLS signatures can be provided as either of 2 unique byte arrays. Lotus block validation functions perform a uniqueness check on provided blocks. Two blocks are considered distinct if the CIDs of their blockheader do not match. The CID method for blockheader includes the BlockSig of the block. The result of these issues is that it would be possible to punish miners for valid blocks, as there are two different valid block CIDs available for each block, even though this must be unique. By switching from the go based `blst` bindings over to the bindings in `filecoin-ffi`, the code paths now ensure that all signatures are compressed by size and the way they are deserialized. This happened in https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/5393.\n\n- CVE-2020-23533: Union Pay up to 1.2.0, for web based versions contains a CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature vulnerability, allows attackers to shop for free in merchants' websites and mobile apps, via a crafted authentication code (MAC) which is generated based on a secret key which is NULL.\n\n- CVE-2021-0152: Improper verification of cryptographic signature in the installer for some Intel(R) Wireless Bluetooth(R) and Killer(TM) Bluetooth(R) products in Windows 10 may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable denial of service via local access.\n\n- CVE-2021-21238: PySAML2 is a pure python implementation of SAML Version 2 Standard. PySAML2 before 6.5.0 has an improper verification of cryptographic signature vulnerability. All users of pysaml2 that need to validate signed SAML documents are impacted. The vulnerability is a variant of XML Signature wrapping because it did not validate the SAML document against an XML schema. This allowed invalid XML documents to be processed and such a document can trick pysaml2 with a wrapped signature. This is fixed in PySAML2 6.5.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-21239: PySAML2 is a pure python implementation of SAML Version 2 Standard. PySAML2 before 6.5.0 has an improper verification of cryptographic signature vulnerability. Users of pysaml2 that use the default CryptoBackendXmlSec1 backend and need to verify signed SAML documents are impacted. PySAML2 does not ensure that a signed SAML document is correctly signed. The default CryptoBackendXmlSec1 backend is using the xmlsec1 binary to verify the signature of signed SAML documents, but by default xmlsec1 accepts any type of key found within the given document. xmlsec1 needs to be configured explicitly to only use only _x509 certificates_ for the verification process of the SAML document signature. This is fixed in PySAML2 6.5.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-22708: A CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature vulnerability exists in EVlink City (EVC1S22P4 / EVC1S7P4 all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1), EVlink Parking (EVW2 / EVF2 / EV.2 all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1), and EVlink Smart Wallbox (EVB1A all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1 ) that could allow an attacker to craft a malicious firmware package and bypass the signature verification mechanism.\n\n- CVE-2021-22734: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature vulnerability exists in homeLYnk (Wiser For KNX) and spaceLYnk V2.60 and prior which could cause remote code execution when an attacker loads unauthorized code.\n\n- CVE-2021-22735: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature vulnerability exists inhomeLYnk (Wiser For KNX) and spaceLYnk V2.60 and prior which could allow remote code execution when unauthorized code is copied to the device.\n\n- CVE-2021-28091: Lasso all versions prior to 2.7.0 has improper verification of a cryptographic signature.\n\n- CVE-2021-3033: An improper verification of cryptographic signature vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks Prisma Cloud Compute console. This vulnerability enables an attacker to bypass signature validation during SAML authentication by logging in to the Prisma Cloud Compute console as any authorized user. This issue impacts: All versions of Prisma Cloud Compute 19.11, Prisma Cloud Compute 20.04, and Prisma Cloud Compute 20.09; Prisma Cloud Compute 20.12 before update 1. Prisma Cloud Compute SaaS version is not impacted by this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2021-3051: An improper verification of cryptographic signature vulnerability exists in Cortex XSOAR SAML authentication that enables an unauthenticated network-based attacker with specific knowledge of the Cortex XSOAR instance to access protected resources and perform unauthorized actions on the Cortex XSOAR server. This issue impacts: Cortex XSOAR 5.5.0 builds earlier than 1578677; Cortex XSOAR 6.0.2 builds earlier than 1576452; Cortex XSOAR 6.1.0 builds earlier than 1578663; Cortex XSOAR 6.2.0 builds earlier than 1578666. All Cortex XSOAR instances hosted by Palo Alto Networks are protected from this vulnerability; no additional action is required for these instances.\n\n- CVE-2021-33885: An Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity vulnerability in B. Braun SpaceCom2 prior to 012U000062 allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to send the device malicious data that will be used in place of the correct data. This results in full system command access and execution because of the lack of cryptographic signatures on critical data sets.\n\n- CVE-2021-37160: A firmware validation issue was discovered in HMI3 Control Panel in Swisslog Healthcare Nexus Panel operated by released versions of software before Nexus Software 7.2.5.7. There is no firmware validation (e.g., cryptographic signature validation) during a File Upload for a firmware update.\n\n- CVE-2020-36284: Union Pay up to 3.4.93.4.9, for android, contains a CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature vulnerability, allows attackers to shop for free in merchants' websites and mobile apps, via a crafted authentication code (MAC) which is generated based on a secret key which is NULL.\n\n- CVE-2020-36285: Union Pay up to 3.3.12, for iOS mobile apps, contains a CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature vulnerability, allows attackers to shop for free in merchants' websites and mobile apps, via a crafted authentication code (MAC) which is generated based on a secret key which is NULL.\n\n- CVE-2021-32685: tEnvoy contains the PGP, NaCl, and PBKDF2 in node.js and the browser (hashing, random, encryption, decryption, signatures, conversions), used by TogaTech.org. In versions prior to 7.0.3, the `verifyWithMessage` method of `tEnvoyNaClSigningKey` always returns `true` for any signature that has a SHA-512 hash matching the SHA-512 hash of the message even if the signature was invalid. This issue is patched in version 7.0.3. As a workaround: In `tenvoy.js` under the `verifyWithMessage` method definition within the `tEnvoyNaClSigningKey` class, ensure that the return statement call to `this.verify` ends in `.verified`.\n\n- CVE-2021-32738: js-stellar-sdk is a Javascript library for communicating with a Stellar Horizon server. The `Utils.readChallengeTx` function used in SEP-10 Stellar Web Authentication states in its function documentation that it reads and validates the challenge transaction including verifying that the `serverAccountID` has signed the transaction. In js-stellar-sdk before version 8.2.3, the function does not verify that the server has signed the transaction. Applications that also used `Utils.verifyChallengeTxThreshold` or `Utils.verifyChallengeTxSigners` to verify the signatures including the server signature on the challenge transaction are unaffected as those functions verify the server signed the transaction. Applications calling `Utils.readChallengeTx` should update to version 8.2.3, the first version with a patch for this vulnerability, to ensure that the challenge transaction is completely valid and signed by the server creating the challenge transaction.\n\n- CVE-2021-37927: Zoho ManageEngine ADManager Plus version 7110 and prior allows account takeover via SSO.\n\n- CVE-2021-29108: There is an privilege escalation vulnerability in organization-specific logins in Esri Portal for ArcGIS versions 10.9 and below that may allow a remote, authenticated attacker who is able to intercept and modify a SAML assertion to impersonate another account (XML Signature Wrapping Attack). In addition patching, Esri also strongly recommends as best practice for SAML assertions to be signed and encrypted.\n\n- CVE-2021-20156: Trendnet AC2600 TEW-827DRU version 2.08B01 contains an improper access control configuration that could allow for a malicious firmware update. It is possible to manually install firmware that may be malicious in nature as there does not appear to be any signature validation done to determine if it is from a known and trusted source. This includes firmware updates that are done via the automated \"check for updates\" in the admin interface. If an attacker is able to masquerade as the update server, the device will not verify that the firmware updates downloaded are legitimate.\n\n- CVE-2020-1464: A spoofing vulnerability exists when Windows incorrectly validates file signatures. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could bypass security features and load improperly signed files. In an attack scenario, an attacker could bypass security features intended to prevent improperly signed files from being loaded. The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Windows validates file signatures. \n\n- CVE-2020-2021: When Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) authentication is enabled and the 'Validate Identity Provider Certificate' option is disabled (unchecked), improper verification of signatures in PAN-OS SAML authentication enables an unauthenticated network-based attacker to access protected resources. The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable server to exploit this vulnerability. This issue affects PAN-OS 9.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.1.3; PAN-OS 9.0 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.0.9; PAN-OS 8.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 8.1.15, and all versions of PAN-OS 8.0 (EOL). This issue does not affect PAN-OS 7.1. This issue cannot be exploited if SAML is not used for authentication. This issue cannot be exploited if the 'Validate Identity Provider Certificate' option is enabled (checked) in the SAML Identity Provider Server Profile. Resources that can be protected by SAML-based single sign-on (SSO) authentication are: GlobalProtect Gateway, GlobalProtect Portal, GlobalProtect Clientless VPN, Authentication and Captive Portal, PAN-OS next-generation firewalls (PA-Series, VM-Series) and Panorama web interfaces, Prisma Access In the case of GlobalProtect Gateways, GlobalProtect Portal, Clientless VPN, Captive Portal, and Prisma Access, an unauthenticated attacker with network access to the affected servers can gain access to protected resources if allowed by configured authentication and Security policies. There is no impact on the integrity and availability of the gateway, portal or VPN server. An attacker cannot inspect or tamper with sessions of regular users. In the worst case, this is a critical severity vulnerability with a CVSS Base Score of 10.0 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N). In the case of PAN-OS and Panorama web interfaces, this issue allows an unauthenticated attacker with network access to the PAN-OS or Panorama web interfaces to log in as an administrator and perform administrative actions. In the worst-case scenario, this is a critical severity vulnerability with a CVSS Base Score of 10.0 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H). If the web interfaces are only accessible to a restricted management network, then the issue is lowered to a CVSS Base Score of 9.6 (CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H). Palo Alto Networks is not aware of any malicious attempts to exploit this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2021-32977: AVEVA System Platform versions 2017 through 2020 R2 P01 does not verify, or incorrectly verifies, the cryptographic signature for data.\n\n- CVE-2021-35097: Possible authentication bypass due to improper order of signature verification and hashing in the signature verification call in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Mobile, Snapdragon Voice & Music, Snapdragon Wearables\n\n- CVE-2021-35113: Possible authentication bypass due to improper order of signature verification and hashing in the signature verification call in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Mobile, Snapdragon Wearables\n\n- CVE-2021-36277: Dell Command | Update, Dell Update, and Alienware Update versions before 4.3 contains an Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature Vulnerability. A local authenticated malicious user may exploit this vulnerability by executing arbitrary code on the system.\n\n- CVE-2021-43074: An improper verification of cryptographic signature vulnerability [CWE-347] in FortiWeb 6.4 all versions, 6.3.16 and below, 6.2 all versions, 6.1 all versions, 6.0 all versions; FortiOS 7.0.3 and below, 6.4.8 and below, 6.2 all versions, 6.0 all versions; FortiSwitch 7.0.3 and below, 6.4.10 and below, 6.2 all versions, 6.0 all versions; FortiProxy 7.0.1 and below, 2.0.7 and below, 1.2 all versions, 1.1 all versions, 1.0 all versions may allow an attacker to decrypt portions of the administrative session management cookie if able to intercept the latter.\n\n- CVE-2022-1739: The tested version of Dominion Voting Systems ImageCast X does not validate application signatures to a trusted root certificate. Use of a trusted root certificate ensures software installed on a device is traceable to, or verifiable against, a cryptographic key provided by the manufacturer to detect tampering. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to install malicious code, which could also be spread to other vulnerable ImageCast X devices via removable media.\n\n- CVE-2022-20929: A vulnerability in the upgrade signature verification of Cisco Enterprise NFV Infrastructure Software (NFVIS) could allow an unauthenticated, local attacker to provide an unauthentic upgrade file for upload. This vulnerability is due to insufficient cryptographic signature verification of upgrade files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing an administrator with an unauthentic upgrade file. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to fully compromise the Cisco NFVIS system.\n\n- CVE-2022-23507: Tendermint is a high-performance blockchain consensus engine for Byzantine fault tolerant applications. Versions prior to 0.28.0 contain a potential attack via Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature, affecting anyone using the tendermint-light-client and related packages to perform light client verification (e.g. IBC-rs, Hermes). The light client does not check that the chain IDs of the trusted and untrusted headers match, resulting in a possible attack vector where someone who finds a header from an untrusted chain that satisfies all other verification conditions (e.g. enough overlapping validator signatures) could fool a light client. The attack vector is currently theoretical, and no proof-of-concept exists yet to exploit it on live networks. This issue is patched in version 0.28.0. There are no workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-24759: `@chainsafe/libp2p-noise` contains TypeScript implementation of noise protocol, an encryption protocol used in libp2p. `@chainsafe/libp2p-noise` before 4.1.2 and 5.0.3 does not correctly validate signatures during the handshake process. This may allow a man-in-the-middle to pose as other peers and get those peers banned. Users should upgrade to version 4.1.2 or 5.0.3 to receive a patch. There are currently no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-25898: The package jsrsasign before 10.5.25 are vulnerable to Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature when JWS or JWT signature with non Base64URL encoding special characters or number escaped characters may be validated as valid by mistake. Workaround: Validate JWS or JWT signature if it has Base64URL and dot safe string before executing JWS.verify() or JWS.verifyJWT() method.\n\n- CVE-2022-2790: Emerson Electric's Proficy Machine Edition Version 9.00 and prior is vulenrable to CWE-347 Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature, and does not properly verify compiled logic (PDT files) and data blocks data (BLD/BLK files).\n\n- CVE-2022-31156: Gradle is a build tool. Dependency verification is a security feature in Gradle Build Tool that was introduced to allow validation of external dependencies either through their checksum or cryptographic signatures. In versions 6.2 through 7.4.2, there are some cases in which Gradle may skip that verification and accept a dependency that would otherwise fail the build as an untrusted external artifact. This can occur in two ways. When signature verification is disabled but the verification metadata contains entries for dependencies that only have a `gpg` element but no `checksum` element. When signature verification is enabled, the verification metadata contains entries for dependencies with a `gpg` element but there is no signature file on the remote repository. In both cases, the verification will accept the dependency, skipping signature verification and not complaining that the dependency has no checksum entry. For builds that are vulnerable, there are two risks. Gradle could download a malicious binary from a repository outside your organization due to name squatting. For those still using HTTP only and not HTTPS for downloading dependencies, the build could download a malicious library instead of the expected one. Gradle 7.5 patches this issue by making sure to run checksum verification if signature verification cannot be completed, whatever the reason. Two workarounds are available: Remove all `gpg` elements from dependency verification metadata if you disable signature validation and/or avoid adding `gpg` entries for dependencies that do not have signature files.\n\n- CVE-2022-31206: The Omron SYSMAC Nx product family PLCs (NJ series, NY series, NX series, and PMAC series) through 2022-005-18 lack cryptographic authentication. These PLCs are programmed using the SYMAC Studio engineering software (which compiles IEC 61131-3 conformant POU code to native machine code for execution by the PLC's runtime). The resulting machine code is executed by a runtime, typically controlled by a real-time operating system. The logic that is downloaded to the PLC does not seem to be cryptographically authenticated, allowing an attacker to manipulate transmitted object code to the PLC and execute arbitrary machine code on the processor of the PLC's CPU module in the context of the runtime. In the case of at least the NJ series, an RTOS and hardware combination is used that would potentially allow for memory protection and privilege separation and thus limit the impact of code execution. However, it was not confirmed whether these sufficiently segment the runtime from the rest of the RTOS.\n\n- CVE-2022-31207: The Omron SYSMAC Cx product family PLCs (CS series, CJ series, and CP series) through 2022-05-18 lack cryptographic authentication. They utilize the Omron FINS (9600/TCP) protocol for engineering purposes, including downloading projects and control logic to the PLC. This protocol has authentication flaws as reported in FSCT-2022-0057. Control logic is downloaded to PLC volatile memory using the FINS Program Area Read and Program Area Write commands or to non-volatile memory using other commands from where it can be loaded into volatile memory for execution. The logic that is loaded into and executed from the user program area exists in compiled object code form. Upon execution, these object codes are first passed to a dedicated ASIC that determines whether the object code is to be executed by the ASIC or the microprocessor. In the former case, the object code is interpreted by the ASIC whereas in the latter case the object code is passed to the microprocessor for object code interpretation by a ROM interpreter. In the abnormal case where the object code cannot be handled by either, an abnormal condition is triggered and the PLC is halted. The logic that is downloaded to the PLC does not seem to be cryptographically authenticated, thus allowing an attacker to manipulate transmitted object code to the PLC and either execute arbitrary object code commands on the ASIC or on the microprocessor interpreter.\n\n- CVE-2022-34459:  Dell Command | Update, Dell Update, and Alienware Update versions prior to 4.7 contain a improper verification of cryptographic signature in get applicable driver component. A local malicious user could potentially exploit this vulnerability leading to malicious payload execution. \n\n- CVE-2022-39366: DataHub is an open-source metadata platform. Prior to version 0.8.45, the `StatelessTokenService` of the DataHub metadata service (GMS) does not verify the signature of JWT tokens. This allows an attacker to connect to DataHub instances as any user if Metadata Service authentication is enabled. This vulnerability occurs because the `StatelessTokenService` of the Metadata service uses the `parse` method of `io.jsonwebtoken.JwtParser`, which does not perform a verification of the cryptographic token signature. This means that JWTs are accepted regardless of the used algorithm. This issue may lead to an authentication bypass. Version 0.8.45 contains a patch for the issue. There are no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-41666: A CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature vulnerability exists that allows adversaries with local user privileges to load a malicious DLL which could lead to execution of malicious code. Affected Products: EcoStruxure Operator Terminal Expert(V3.3 Hotfix 1 or prior), Pro-face BLUE(V3.3 Hotfix1 or prior).\n\n- CVE-2022-41669: A CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature vulnerability exists in the SGIUtility component that allows adversaries with local user privileges to load a malicious DLL which could result in execution of malicious code. Affected Products: EcoStruxure Operator Terminal Expert(V3.3 Hotfix 1 or prior), Pro-face BLUE(V3.3 Hotfix1 or prior).\n\n- CVE-2021-23993: An attacker may perform a DoS attack to prevent a user from sending encrypted email to a correspondent. If an attacker creates a crafted OpenPGP key with a subkey that has an invalid self signature, and the Thunderbird user imports the crafted key, then Thunderbird may try to use the invalid subkey, but the RNP library rejects it from being used, causing encryption to fail. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 78.9.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-23540: In versions `<=8.5.1` of `jsonwebtoken` library, lack of algorithm definition in the `jwt.verify()` function can lead to signature validation bypass due to defaulting to the `none` algorithm for signature verification. Users are affected if you do not specify algorithms in the `jwt.verify()` function. This issue has been fixed, please update to version 9.0.0 which removes the default support for the none algorithm in the `jwt.verify()` method. There will be no impact, if you update to version 9.0.0 and you don\u2019t need to allow for the `none` algorithm. If you need 'none' algorithm, you have to explicitly specify that in `jwt.verify()` options. \n\n- CVE-2022-42793: An issue in code signature validation was addressed with improved checks. This issue is fixed in macOS Big Sur 11.7, macOS Ventura 13, iOS 16, iOS 15.7 and iPadOS 15.7, macOS Monterey 12.6. An app may be able to bypass code signing checks.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-345 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-345 (ChildOf)",

No Windows Service or separate process required. Dashboard UI in Hangfire.Core uses authorization filters to protect it from showing sensitive data to unauthorized users. By default when no custom authorization filters specified, `LocalRequestsOnlyAuthorizationFilter` filter is being used to allow only local requests and prohibit all the remote requests to provide sensible, protected by default settings. However due to the recent changes, in version 1.7.25 no authorization filters are used by default, allowing remote requests to succeed. If you are using `UseHangfireDashboard` method with default `DashboardOptions.Authorization` property value, then your installation is impacted. If any other authorization filter is specified in the `DashboardOptions.Authorization` property, the you are not impacted. Patched versions (1.7.26) are available both on Nuget.org and as a tagged release on the github repo. Default authorization rules now prohibit remote requests by default again by including the `LocalRequestsOnlyAuthorizationFilter` filter to the default settings. Please upgrade to the newest version in order to mitigate the issue. For users who are unable to upgrade it is possible to mitigate the issue by using the `LocalRequestsOnlyAuthorizationFilter` explicitly when configuring the Dashboard UI.\n\n- CVE-2021-42062: SAP ERP HCM Portugal does not perform necessary authorization checks for a report that reads the payroll data of employees in a certain area. Since the affected report only reads the payroll information, the attacker can neither modify any information nor cause availability impacts.\n\n- CVE-2021-42359: WP DSGVO Tools (GDPR) <= 3.1.23 had an AJAX action, \u2018admin-dismiss-unsubscribe\u2018, which lacked a capability check and a nonce check and was available to unauthenticated users, and did not check the post type when deleting unsubscription requests. As such, it was possible for an attacker to permanently delete an arbitrary post or page on the site by sending an AJAX request with the \u201caction\u201d parameter set to \u201cadmin-dismiss-unsubscribe\u201d and the \u201cid\u201d parameter set to the post to be deleted. Sending such a request would move the post to the trash, and repeating the request would permanently delete the post in question.\n\n- CVE-2021-1143: A vulnerability in Cisco Connected Mobile Experiences (CMX) API authorizations could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to enumerate what users exist on the system. The vulnerability is due to a lack of authorization checks for certain API GET requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specific API GET requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to enumerate users of the CMX system.\n\n- CVE-2021-20283: The web service responsible for fetching other users' enrolled courses did not validate that the requesting user had permission to view that information in each course in moodle before 3.10.2, 3.9.5, 3.8.8, 3.5.17.\n\n- CVE-2021-21481: The MigrationService, which is part of SAP NetWeaver versions 7.10, 7.11, 7.20, 7.30, 7.31, 7.40, 7.50, does not perform an authorization check. This might allow an unauthorized attacker to access configuration objects, including such that grant administrative privileges. This could result in complete compromise of system confidentiality, integrity, and availability.\n\n- CVE-2021-27509: In Visualware MyConnection Server before 11.0b build 5382, each published report is not associated with its own access code.\n\n- CVE-2021-34647: The Ninja Forms WordPress plugin is vulnerable to sensitive information disclosure via the bulk_export_submissions function found in the ~/includes/Routes/Submissions.php file, in versions up to and including 3.5.7. This allows authenticated attackers to export all Ninja Forms submissions data via the /ninja-forms-submissions/export REST API which can include personally identifiable information.\n\n- CVE-2021-34648: The Ninja Forms WordPress plugin is vulnerable to arbitrary email sending via the trigger_email_action function found in the ~/includes/Routes/Submissions.php file, in versions up to and including 3.5.7. This allows authenticated attackers to send arbitrary emails from the affected server via the /ninja-forms-submissions/email-action REST API which can be used to socially engineer victims.\n\n- CVE-2021-36909: Authenticated Database Reset vulnerability in WordPress WP Reset PRO Premium plugin (versions <= 5.98) allows any authenticated user to wipe the entire database regardless of their authorization. It leads to a complete website reset and takeover.\n\n- CVE-2021-38698: HashiCorp Consul and Consul Enterprise 1.10.1 Txn.Apply endpoint allowed services to register proxies for other services, enabling access to service traffic.

Because of not checking authorization in ids parameter in files-edit.php and id parameter in process.php function, a user with uploader role can download and edit all files of users in application.\n\n- CVE-2021-41554: ARCHIBUS Web Central 21.3.3.815 (a version from 2014) does not properly validate requests for access to data and functionality in these affected endpoints: /archibus/schema/ab-edit-users.axvw, /archibus/schema/ab-data-dictionary-table.axvw, /archibus/schema/ab-schema-add-field.axvw, /archibus/schema/ab-core/views/process-navigator/ab-my-user-profile.axvw. By not verifying the permissions for access to resources, it allows a potential attacker to view pages that are not allowed. Specifically, it was found that any authenticated user can reach the administrative console for user management by directly requesting access to the page via URL. This allows a malicious user to modify all users' profiles, to elevate any privileges to administrative ones, or to create or delete any type of user. It is also possible to modify the emails of other users, through a misconfiguration of the username parameter, on the user profile page. This is fixed in all recent versions, such as version 26. NOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer. Version 21.3 was officially de-supported by the end of 2020\n\n- CVE-2021-1506: Multiple vulnerabilities in Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or gain access to sensitive information, or allow an authenticated, local attacker to gain escalated privileges or gain unauthorized access to the application. For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2021-21432: Vela is a Pipeline Automation (CI/CD) framework built on Linux container technology written in Golang.

Refer to the referenced GitHub Security Advisory for complete details. This is fixed in version 0.7.5.\n\n- CVE-2021-32748: Nextcloud Richdocuments in an open source self hosted online office. Nextcloud uses the WOPI (\"Web Application Open Platform Interface\") protocol to communicate with the Collabora Editor, the communication between these two services was not protected by a credentials or IP check. Whilst this does not result in gaining access to data that the user has not yet access to, it can result in a bypass of any enforced watermark on documents as described on the [Nextcloud Virtual Data Room](https://nextcloud.com/virtual-data-room/) website and [our documentation](https://portal.nextcloud.com/article/nextcloud-and-virtual-data-room-configuration-59.html). The Nextcloud Richdocuments releases 3.8.3 and 4.2.0 add an additional admin settings for an allowlist of IP addresses that can access the WOPI API. We recommend upgrading and configuring the allowlist to a list of Collabora servers. There is no known workaround. Note that this primarily results a bypass of any configured watermark or download protection using File Access Control. If you do not require or rely on these as a security feature no immediate action is required on your end.\n\n- CVE-2021-3653: A flaw was found in the KVM's AMD code for supporting SVM nested virtualization. The flaw occurs when processing the VMCB (virtual machine control block) provided by the L1 guest to spawn/handle a nested guest (L2). Due to improper validation of the \"int_ctl\" field, this issue could allow a malicious L1 to enable AVIC support (Advanced Virtual Interrupt Controller) for the L2 guest. As a result, the L2 guest would be allowed to read/write physical pages of the host, resulting in a crash of the entire system, leak of sensitive data or potential guest-to-host escape. This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to 5.14-rc7.\n\n- CVE-2021-25409: Improper access in Notification setting prior to SMR JUN-2021 Release 1 allows physically proximate attackers to set arbitrary notification via physically configuring device.\n\n- CVE-2021-24851: The Insert Pages WordPress plugin before 3.7.0 allows users with a role as low as Contributor to access content and metadata from arbitrary posts/pages regardless of their author and status (ie private), using a shortcode. Password protected posts/pages are not affected by such issue.\n\n- CVE-2021-21984: VMware vRealize Business for Cloud 7.x prior to 7.6.0 contains a remote code execution vulnerability due to an unauthorised end point. A malicious actor with network access may exploit this issue causing unauthorised remote code execution on vRealize Business for Cloud Virtual Appliance.\n\n- CVE-2021-27903: An issue was discovered in Craft CMS before 3.6.7. In some circumstances, a potential Remote Code Execution vulnerability existed on sites that did not restrict administrative changes (if an attacker were somehow able to hijack an administrator's session).\n\n- CVE-2021-35413: A remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in course_intro_pdf_import.php of Chamilo LMS v1.11.x allows authenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted .htaccess file.\n\n- CVE-2021-21382: Restund is an open source NAT traversal server. The restund TURN server can be instructed to open a relay to the loopback address range. This allows you to reach any other service running on localhost which you might consider private. In the configuration that we ship (https://github.com/wireapp/ansible-restund/blob/master/templates/restund.conf.j2#L40-L43) the `status` interface of restund is enabled and is listening on `127.0.0.1`.The `status` interface allows users to issue administrative commands to `restund` like listing open relays or draining connections. It would be possible for an attacker to contact the status interface and issue administrative commands by setting `XOR-PEER-ADDRESS` to `127.0.0.1:{{restund_udp_status_port}}` when opening a TURN channel. We now explicitly disallow relaying to loopback addresses, 'any' addresses, link local addresses, and the broadcast address. As a workaround disable the `status` module in your restund configuration. However there might still be other services running on `127.0.0.0/8` that you do not want to have exposed. The `turn` module can be disabled. Restund will still perform STUN and this might already be enough for initiating calls in your environments. TURN is only used as a last resort when other NAT traversal options do not work. One should also make sure that the TURN server is set up with firewall rules so that it cannot relay to other addresses that you don't want the TURN server to relay to. For example other services in the same VPC where the TURN server is running. Ideally TURN servers should be deployed in an isolated fashion where they can only reach what they need to reach to perform their task of assisting NAT-traversal.\n\n- CVE-2021-36917: WordPress Hide My WP plugin (versions <= 6.2.3) can be deactivated by any unauthenticated user. It is possible to retrieve a reset token which can then be used to deactivate the plugin.\n\n- CVE-2021-39184: Electron is a framework for writing cross-platform desktop applications using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. A vulnerability in versions prior to 11.5.0, 12.1.0, and 13.3.0 allows a sandboxed renderer to request a \"thumbnail\" image of an arbitrary file on the user's system. The thumbnail can potentially include significant parts of the original file, including textual data in many cases. Versions 15.0.0-alpha.10, 14.0.0, 13.3.0, 12.1.0, and 11.5.0 all contain a fix for the vulnerability. Two workarounds aside from upgrading are available. One may make the vulnerability significantly more difficult for an attacker to exploit by enabling `contextIsolation` in one's app. One may also disable the functionality of the `createThumbnailFromPath` API if one does not need it.\n\n- CVE-2021-39231: In Apache Ozone versions prior to 1.2.0, Various internal server-to-server RPC endpoints are available for connections, making it possible for an attacker to download raw data from Datanode and Ozone manager and modify Ratis replication configuration.\n\n- CVE-2021-29958: When a download was initiated, the client did not check whether it was in normal or private browsing mode, which led to private mode cookies being shared in normal browsing mode. This vulnerability affects Firefox for iOS < 34.\n\n- CVE-2020-11511: The LearnPress plugin before 3.2.6.9 for WordPress allows remote attackers to escalate the privileges of any user to LP Instructor via the accept-to-be-teacher action parameter.\n\n- CVE-2020-11967: In IQrouter through 3.3.1, remote attackers can control the device (restart network, reboot, upgrade, reset) because of Incorrect Access Control. Note: The vendor claims that this vulnerability can only occur on a brand-new network that, after initiating the forced initial configuration (which has a required step for setting a secure password on the system), makes this CVE invalid. This vulnerability is \u201ctrue for any unconfigured release of OpenWRT, and true of many other new Linux distros prior to being configured for the first time\u201d\n\n- CVE-2021-24184: Several AJAX endpoints in the Tutor LMS \u2013 eLearning and online course solution WordPress plugin before 1.7.7 were unprotected, allowing students to modify course information and elevate their privileges among many other actions.\n\n- CVE-2021-24354: A lack of capability checks and insufficient nonce check on the AJAX action in the Simple 301 Redirects by BetterLinks WordPress plugin before 2.0.4, made it possible for authenticated users to install arbitrary plugins on vulnerable sites.\n\n- CVE-2021-26758: Privilege Escalation in LiteSpeed Technologies OpenLiteSpeed web server version 1.7.8 allows attackers to gain root terminal access and execute commands on the host system.\n\n- CVE-2021-38388: Central Dogma allows privilege escalation with mirroring to the internal dogma repository that has a file managing the authorization of the project.\n\n- CVE-2020-25629: A vulnerability was found in Moodle where users with \"Log in as\" capability in a course context (typically, course managers) may gain access to some site administration capabilities by \"logging in as\" a System manager.

All unpatched versions of Argo CD starting with 1.0.0 are vulnerable to an improper access control bug, allowing a malicious user to potentially escalate their privileges to admin-level. Versions starting with 0.8.0 and 0.5.0 contain limited versions of this issue. To perform exploits, an authorized Argo CD user must have push access to an Application's source git or Helm repository or `sync` and `override` access to an Application. Once a user has that access, different exploitation levels are possible depending on their other RBAC privileges. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in Argo CD versions 2.3.2, 2.2.8, and 2.1.14. Some mitigation measures are available but do not serve as a substitute for upgrading. To avoid privilege escalation, limit who has push access to Application source repositories or `sync` + `override` access to Applications; and limit which repositories are available in projects where users have `update` access to Applications. To avoid unauthorized resource inspection/tampering, limit who has `delete`, `get`, or `action` access to Applications.\n\n- CVE-2022-28866: Multiple Improper Access Control was discovered in Nokia AirFrame BMC Web GUI < R18 Firmware v4.13.00.

Sourcegraph prior to version 3.37 is vulnerable to remote code execution in the `gitserver` service. The service acts as a git exec proxy, and fails to properly restrict calling `git config`. This allows an attacker to set the git `core.sshCommand` option, which sets git to use the specified command instead of ssh when they need to connect to a remote system. Exploitation of this vulnerability depends on how Sourcegraph is deployed. An attacker able to make HTTP requests to internal services like gitserver is able to exploit it. This issue is patched in Sourcegraph version 3.37. As a workaround, ensure that requests to gitserver are properly protected.\n\n- CVE-2022-4223: The pgAdmin server includes an HTTP API that is intended to be used to validate the path a user selects to external PostgreSQL utilities such as pg_dump and pg_restore. The utility is executed by the server to determine what PostgreSQL version it is from. Versions of pgAdmin prior to 6.17 failed to properly secure this API, which could allow an unauthenticated user to call it with a path of their choosing, such as a UNC path to a server they control on a Windows machine. This would cause an appropriately named executable in the target path to be executed by the pgAdmin server.\n\n- CVE-2022-41417: BlogEngine.NET v3.3.8.0 allows an attacker to create any folder with \"files\" prefix under ~/App_Data/.\n\n- CVE-2022-0287: The myCred WordPress plugin before 2.4.4.1 does not have any authorisation in place in its mycred-tools-select-user AJAX action, allowing any authenticated user, such as subscriber to call and retrieve all email addresses from the blog\n\n- CVE-2022-0588: Missing Authorization in Packagist librenms/librenms prior to 22.2.0. \n\n- CVE-2022-31095: discourse-chat is a chat plugin for the Discourse application.

Dex instances with public clients (and by extension, clients accepting tokens issued by those Dex instances) are affected by this vulnerability if they are running a version prior to 2.35.0. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by making a victim navigate to a malicious website and guiding them through the OIDC flow, stealing the OAuth authorization code in the process. The authorization code then can be exchanged by the attacker for a token, gaining access to applications accepting that token. Version 2.35.0 has introduced a fix for this issue. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-39289: ZoneMinder is a free, open source Closed-circuit television software application.

          "matched_text": "CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password\n\nType: Variant\n\nStatus: Draft\n\nDescription:\n\nThe product contains a hard-coded password, which it uses for its own inbound authentication or for outbound communication to external components.\n\nExtended Details:\n\n\n\nA hard-coded password typically leads to a significant authentication failure that can be difficult for the system administrator to detect. Once detected, it can be difficult to fix, so the administrator may be forced into disabling the product entirely. There are two main variations:\n\n```\n\t\tInbound: the product contains an authentication mechanism that checks for a hard-coded password.\n\t\tOutbound: the product connects to another system or component, and it contains hard-coded password for connecting to that component.\n```\nIn the Inbound variant, a default administration account is created, and a simple password is hard-coded into the product and associated with that account. This hard-coded password is the same for each installation of the product, and it usually cannot be changed or disabled by system administrators without manually modifying the program, or otherwise patching the product. If the password is ever discovered or published (a common occurrence on the Internet), then anybody with knowledge of this password can access the product. Finally, since all installations of the product will have the same password, even across different organizations, this enables massive attacks such as worms to take place.\n\nThe Outbound variant applies to front-end systems that authenticate with a back-end service. The back-end service may require a fixed password which can be easily discovered. The programmer may simply hard-code those back-end credentials into the front-end product. Any user of that program may be able to extract the password. Client-side systems with hard-coded passwords pose even more of a threat, since the extraction of a password from a binary is usually very simple.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-29964: Distributed Control System (DCS) has hard-coded passwords for local shell access\n\n- CVE-2021-37555: Telnet service for IoT feeder for dogs and cats has hard-coded password [REF-1288]\n\n- CVE-2021-35033: Firmware for a WiFi router uses a hard-coded password for a BusyBox shell, allowing bypass of authentication through the UART port\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-27438: The software contains a hard-coded password it uses for its own inbound authentication or for outbound communication to external components on the Reason DR60 (all firmware versions prior to 02A04.1).\n\n- CVE-2021-34757: Multiple vulnerabilities in Cisco Business 220 Series Smart Switches firmware could allow an attacker with Administrator privileges to access sensitive login credentials or reconfigure the passwords on the user account.

It is possible to define an entity by providing a substitution string in the form of a URI. The XML parser can access the contents of this URI and embed these contents back into the XML document for further processing.\n\n\nBy submitting an XML file that defines an external entity with a file:// URI, an attacker can cause the processing application to read the contents of a local file. For example, a URI such as \"file:///c:/winnt/win.ini\" designates (in Windows) the file C:\\Winnt\\win.ini, or file:///etc/passwd designates the password file in Unix-based systems. Using URIs with other schemes such as http://, the attacker can force the application to make outgoing requests to servers that the attacker cannot reach directly, which can be used to bypass firewall restrictions or hide the source of attacks such as port scanning.\n\n\nOnce the content of the URI is read, it is fed back into the application that is processing the XML. This application may echo back the data (e.g. in an error message), thereby exposing the file contents.\n",

For example, because UDP is a connectionless protocol, UDP packets can be spoofed by specifying a false source address in the packet; when the server receives the packet and sends a reply, it will specify a destination by using the source of the incoming packet - i.e., the false source. The server can then be tricked into sending traffic to the wrong host, which is effective for hiding the real source of an attack and for conducting a distributed denial of service (DDoS). As another example, server-side request forgery (SSRF) and XML External Entity (XXE) can be used to trick a server into making outgoing requests to hosts that cannot be directly accessed by the attacker due to firewall restrictions.\n\n  - If the product incorrectly specifies the destination, then an attacker who can control this destination might be able to spoof trusted servers. While the most common occurrence is likely due to misconfiguration by an administrator, this can be resultant from other weaknesses. For example, the product might incorrectly parse an e-mail or IP address and send sensitive data to an unintended destination. As another example, an Android application may use a \"sticky broadcast\" to communicate with a receiver for a particular application, but since sticky broadcasts can be processed by *any* receiver, this can allow a malicious application to access restricted data that was only intended for a different application.\n\n",

It is possible to define an entity by providing a substitution string in the form of a URI. The XML parser can access the contents of this URI and embed these contents back into the XML document for further processing.\n\n\nBy submitting an XML file that defines an external entity with a file:// URI, an attacker can cause the processing application to read the contents of a local file. For example, a URI such as \"file:///c:/winnt/win.ini\" designates (in Windows) the file C:\\Winnt\\win.ini, or file:///etc/passwd designates the password file in Unix-based systems. Using URIs with other schemes such as http://, the attacker can force the application to make outgoing requests to servers that the attacker cannot reach directly, which can be used to bypass firewall restrictions or hide the source of attacks such as port scanning.\n\n\nOnce the content of the URI is read, it is fed back into the application that is processing the XML. This application may echo back the data (e.g. in an error message), thereby exposing the file contents.\n",

For example, because UDP is a connectionless protocol, UDP packets can be spoofed by specifying a false source address in the packet; when the server receives the packet and sends a reply, it will specify a destination by using the source of the incoming packet - i.e., the false source. The server can then be tricked into sending traffic to the wrong host, which is effective for hiding the real source of an attack and for conducting a distributed denial of service (DDoS). As another example, server-side request forgery (SSRF) and XML External Entity (XXE) can be used to trick a server into making outgoing requests to hosts that cannot be directly accessed by the attacker due to firewall restrictions.\n\n  - If the product incorrectly specifies the destination, then an attacker who can control this destination might be able to spoof trusted servers. While the most common occurrence is likely due to misconfiguration by an administrator, this can be resultant from other weaknesses. For example, the product might incorrectly parse an e-mail or IP address and send sensitive data to an unintended destination. As another example, an Android application may use a \"sticky broadcast\" to communicate with a receiver for a particular application, but since sticky broadcasts can be processed by *any* receiver, this can allow a malicious application to access restricted data that was only intended for a different application.\n\n",

            "matched_text": "CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference\n\nType: Base\n\nStatus: Draft\n\nAlternative Terms:\n\nXXE - An acronym used for the term \"XML eXternal Entities\"\n\nXXE - An acronym used for the term \"XML eXternal Entities\"\n\nXXE - An acronym used for the term \"XML eXternal Entities\"\n\nDescription:\n\nThe product processes an XML document that can contain XML entities with URIs that resolve to documents outside of the intended sphere of control, causing the product to embed incorrect documents into its output.\n\nExtended Details:\n\n\n\nXML documents optionally contain a Document Type Definition (DTD), which, among other features, enables the definition of XML entities. It is possible to define an entity by providing a substitution string in the form of a URI. The XML parser can access the contents of this URI and embed these contents back into the XML document for further processing.\n\n\nBy submitting an XML file that defines an external entity with a file:// URI, an attacker can cause the processing application to read the contents of a local file. For example, a URI such as \"file:///c:/winnt/win.ini\" designates (in Windows) the file C:\\Winnt\\win.ini, or file:///etc/passwd designates the password file in Unix-based systems. Using URIs with other schemes such as http://, the attacker can force the application to make outgoing requests to servers that the attacker cannot reach directly, which can be used to bypass firewall restrictions or hide the source of attacks such as port scanning.\n\n\nOnce the content of the URI is read, it is fed back into the application that is processing the XML. This application may echo back the data (e.g. in an error message), thereby exposing the file contents.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-42745: Recruiter software allows reading arbitrary files using XXE\n\n- CVE-2005-1306: A browser control can allow remote attackers to determine the existence of files via Javascript containing XML script.\n\n- CVE-2012-5656: XXE during SVG image conversion\n\n- CVE-2012-2239: XXE in PHP application allows reading the application's configuration file.\n\n- CVE-2012-3489: XXE in database server\n\n- CVE-2012-4399: XXE in rapid web application development framework allows reading arbitrary files.\n\n- CVE-2012-3363: XXE via XML-RPC request.\n\n- CVE-2012-0037: XXE in office document product using RDF.\n\n- CVE-2011-4107: XXE in web-based administration tool for database.\n\n- CVE-2010-3322: XXE in product that performs large-scale data analysis.\n\n- CVE-2009-1699: XXE in XSL stylesheet functionality in a common library used by some web browsers.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-25817: SilverStripe through 4.6.0-rc1 has an XXE Vulnerability in CSSContentParser. A developer utility meant for parsing HTML within unit tests can be vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks. When this developer utility is misused for purposes involving external or user submitted data in custom project code, it can lead to vulnerabilities such as XSS on HTML output rendered through this custom code. This is now mitigated by disabling external entities during parsing. (The correct CVE ID year is 2020 [CVE-2020-25817, not CVE-2021-25817]).\n\n- CVE-2021-20453: IBM WebSphere Application Server 8.0, 8.5, and 9.0 is vulnerable to a XML External Entity Injection (XXE) attack when processing XML data. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to expose sensitive information or consume memory resources. IBM X-Force ID: 196648.\n\n- CVE-2021-22158: The Proofpoint Insider Threat Management Server (formerly ObserveIT Server) is vulnerable to XML external entity (XXE) injection in the Web Console. The vulnerability requires admin user privileges and knowledge of the XML file's encryption key to successfully exploit. All versions before 7.11 are affected.\n\n- CVE-2021-28973: The XML Import functionality of the Administration console in Perforce Helix ALM 2020.3.1 Build 22 accepts XML input data that is parsed by insecurely configured software components, leading to XXE attacks.\n\n- CVE-2021-30137: Assyst 10 SP7.5 has authenticated XXE leading to SSRF via XML unmarshalling. The application allows users to send JSON or XML data to the server. It was possible to inject malicious XML data through several access points.\n\n- CVE-2021-34706: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive information or conduct a server-side request forgery (SSRF) attack through an affected device. This vulnerability is due to improper handling of XML External Entity (XXE) entries when parsing certain XML files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading a crafted XML file that contains references to external entities. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to retrieve files from the local system, resulting in the disclosure of sensitive information, or cause the web application to perform arbitrary HTTP requests on behalf of the attacker.\n\n- CVE-2021-38948: IBM InfoSphere Information Server 11.7 is vulnerable to an XML External Entity Injection (XXE) attack when processing XML data. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to expose sensitive information or consume memory resources. IBM X-Force ID: 211402.\n\n- CVE-2021-2401: Vulnerability in the Oracle BI Publisher product of Oracle Fusion Middleware (component: E-Business Suite - XDO). Supported versions that are affected are 5.5.0.0.0, 11.1.1.9.0, 12.2.1.3.0 and 12.2.1.4.0. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise Oracle BI Publisher. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized read access to a subset of Oracle BI Publisher accessible data. CVSS 3.1 Base Score 5.3 (Confidentiality impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).\n\n- CVE-2021-27635: SAP NetWeaver AS for JAVA, versions - 7.20, 7.30, 7.31, 7.40, 7.50, allows an attacker authenticated as an administrator to connect over a network and submit a specially crafted XML file in the application because of missing XML Validation, this vulnerability enables attacker to fully compromise confidentiality by allowing them to read any file on the filesystem or fully compromise availability by causing the system to crash. The attack cannot be used to change any data so that there is no compromise as to integrity.\n\n- CVE-2021-32925: admin/user_import.php in Chamilo 1.11.x reads XML data without disabling the ability to load external entities.\n\n- CVE-2021-44145: In the TransformXML processor of Apache NiFi before 1.15.1 an authenticated user could configure an XSLT file which, if it included malicious external entity calls, may reveal sensitive information.\n\n- CVE-2021-42560: An issue was discovered in CALDERA 2.9.0. The Debrief plugin receives base64 encoded \"SVG\" parameters when generating a PDF document. These SVG documents are parsed in an unsafe manner and can be leveraged for XXE attacks (e.g., File Exfiltration, Server Side Request Forgery, Out of Band Exfiltration, etc.).\n\n- CVE-2022-23170: SysAid - Okta SSO integration - was found vulnerable to XML External Entity Injection vulnerability. Any SysAid environment that uses the Okta SSO integration might be vulnerable. An unauthenticated attacker could exploit the XXE vulnerability by sending a malformed POST request to the identity provider endpoint. An attacker can extract the identity provider endpoint by decoding the SAMLRequest parameter's value and searching for the AssertionConsumerServiceURL parameter's value. It often allows an attacker to view files on the application server filesystem and interact with any back-end or external systems that the application can access. In some situations, an attacker can escalate an XXE attack to compromise the underlying server or other back-end infrastructure by leveraging the XXE vulnerability to perform server-side request forgery (SSRF) attacks.\n\n- CVE-2022-24449: Solar appScreener through 3.10.4, when a valid license is not present, allows XXE and SSRF attacks via a crafted XML document.\n\n- CVE-2022-2458: XML external entity injection(XXE) is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with an application's processing of XML data. This attack occurs when XML input containing a reference to an external entity is processed by a weakly configured XML parser. The software processes an XML document that can contain XML entities with URIs that resolve to documents outside of the intended sphere of control, causing the product to embed incorrect documents into its output. Here, XML external entity injection lead to External Service interaction & Internal file read in Business Central and also Kie-Server APIs.\n\n- CVE-2022-27193: CVRF-CSAF-Converter before 1.0.0-rc2 resolves XML External Entities (XXE). This leads to the inclusion of arbitrary (local) file content into the generated output document. An attacker can exploit this to disclose information from the system running the converter.\n\n- CVE-2022-3338: An External XML entity (XXE) vulnerability in ePO prior to 5.10 Update 14 can lead to an unauthenticated remote attacker to potentially trigger a Server Side Request Forgery attack. This can be exploited by mimicking the Agent Handler call to ePO and passing the carefully constructed XML file through the API.\n\n- CVE-2022-35741: Apache CloudStack version 4.5.0 and later has a SAML 2.0 authentication Service Provider plugin which is found to be vulnerable to XML external entity (XXE) injection. This plugin is not enabled by default and the attacker would require that this plugin be enabled to exploit the vulnerability. When the SAML 2.0 plugin is enabled in affected versions of Apache CloudStack could potentially allow the exploitation of XXE vulnerabilities. The SAML 2.0 messages constructed during the authentication flow in Apache CloudStack are XML-based and the XML data is parsed by various standard libraries that are now understood to be vulnerable to XXE injection attacks such as arbitrary file reading, possible denial of service, server-side request forgery (SSRF) on the CloudStack management server.\n\n- CVE-2022-38342: Safe Software FME Server v2021.2.5, v2022.0.0.2 and below was discovered to contain a XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability which allows authenticated attackers to perform data exfiltration or Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks.\n\n- CVE-2022-3980: An XML External Entity (XEE) vulnerability allows server-side request forgery (SSRF) and potential code execution in Sophos Mobile managed on-premises between versions 5.0.0 and 9.7.4.\n\n- CVE-2022-42745: CandidATS version 3.0.0 allows an external attacker to read arbitrary files from the server. This is possible because the application is vulnerable to XXE.\n\n- CVE-2022-45194: CBRN-Analysis before 22 allows XXE attacks via am mws XML document, leading to NTLMv2-SSP hash disclosure.\n\n- CVE-2022-45326: An XML external entity (XXE) injection vulnerability in Kwoksys Kwok Information Server before v2.9.5.SP31 allows remote authenticated users to conduct server-side request forgery (SSRF) attacks.\n\n- CVE-2022-46827: In JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA before 2022.3 an XXE attack leading to SSRF via requests to custom plugin repositories was possible.\n\n- CVE-2022-47514: An XML external entity (XXE) injection vulnerability in XML-RPC.NET before 2.5.0 allows remote authenticated users to conduct server-side request forgery (SSRF) attacks, as demonstrated by a pingback.aspx POST request.\n\n- CVE-2022-47873: Netcad KEOS 1.0 is vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) resulting in SSRF with XXE (remote).\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-610 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-610 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-441 (PeerOf)",

For example, because UDP is a connectionless protocol, UDP packets can be spoofed by specifying a false source address in the packet; when the server receives the packet and sends a reply, it will specify a destination by using the source of the incoming packet - i.e., the false source. The server can then be tricked into sending traffic to the wrong host, which is effective for hiding the real source of an attack and for conducting a distributed denial of service (DDoS). As another example, server-side request forgery (SSRF) and XML External Entity (XXE) can be used to trick a server into making outgoing requests to hosts that cannot be directly accessed by the attacker due to firewall restrictions.\n\n  - If the product incorrectly specifies the destination, then an attacker who can control this destination might be able to spoof trusted servers. While the most common occurrence is likely due to misconfiguration by an administrator, this can be resultant from other weaknesses. For example, the product might incorrectly parse an e-mail or IP address and send sensitive data to an unintended destination. As another example, an Android application may use a \"sticky broadcast\" to communicate with a receiver for a particular application, but since sticky broadcasts can be processed by *any* receiver, this can allow a malicious application to access restricted data that was only intended for a different application.\n\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2013-5211: composite: NTP feature generates large responses (high amplification factor) with spoofed UDP source addresses.\n\n- CVE-1999-0513: Classic \"Smurf\" attack, using spoofed ICMP packets to broadcast addresses.\n\n- CVE-1999-1379: DNS query with spoofed source address causes more traffic to be returned to spoofed address than was sent by the attacker.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-0590: In sendNetworkConditionsBroadcast of NetworkMonitor.java, there is a possible way for a privileged app to receive WiFi BSSID and SSID without location permissions due to a missing permission check. This could lead to local information disclosure with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-10 Android-11 Android-8.1 Android-9Android ID: A-175213041\n\n- CVE-2021-25755: In JetBrains Code With Me before 2020.3, an attacker on the local network, knowing a session ID, could get access to the encrypted traffic.\n\n- CVE-2021-0480: In createPendingIntent of SnoozeHelper.java, there is a possible broadcast intent containing a sensitive identifier. This could lead to local information disclosure with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-10 Android-11 Android-8.1 Android-9Android ID: A-174493336\n\n- CVE-2021-44225: In Keepalived through 2.2.4, the D-Bus policy does not sufficiently restrict the message destination, allowing any user to inspect and manipulate any property. This leads to access-control bypass in some situations in which an unrelated D-Bus system service has a settable (writable) property\n\n- CVE-2021-45884: In Brave Desktop 1.17 through 1.33 before 1.33.106, when CNAME-based adblocking and a proxying extension with a SOCKS fallback are enabled, additional DNS requests are issued outside of the proxying extension using the system's DNS settings, resulting in information disclosure. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2021-21323 and CVE-2021-22916.\n\n- CVE-2022-21671: @replit/crosis is a JavaScript client that speaks Replit's container protocol. A vulnerability that involves exposure of sensitive information exists in versions prior to 7.3.1. When using this library as a way to programmatically communicate with Replit in a standalone fashion, if there are multiple failed attempts to contact Replit through a WebSocket, the library will attempt to communicate using a fallback poll-based proxy. The URL of the proxy has changed, so any communication done to the previous URL could potentially reach a server that is outside of Replit's control and the token used to connect to the Repl could be obtained by an attacker, leading to full compromise of that Repl (not of the account). This was patched in version 7.3.1 by updating the address of the fallback WebSocket polling proxy to the new one. As a workaround, a user may specify the new address for the polling host (`gp-v2.replit.com`) in the `ConnectArgs`. More information about this workaround is available in the GitHub Security Advisory.\n\n- CVE-2022-21673: Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. In affected versions when a data source has the Forward OAuth Identity feature enabled, sending a query to that datasource with an API token (and no other user credentials) will forward the OAuth Identity of the most recently logged-in user. This can allow API token holders to retrieve data for which they may not have intended access. This attack relies on the Grafana instance having data sources that support the Forward OAuth Identity feature, the Grafana instance having a data source with the Forward OAuth Identity feature toggled on, the Grafana instance having OAuth enabled, and the Grafana instance having usable API keys. This issue has been patched in versions 7.5.13 and 8.3.4.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-923 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-406 (CanPrecede)",

Further it is also possible to inject PHP code, leading to a Remote Code execution (RCE) vulnerability, even if the DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT and DISALLOW_FILE_MOD constants are both set.\n\n- CVE-2022-35651: A stored XSS and blind SSRF vulnerability was found in Moodle, occurs due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied data in the SCORM track details. A remote attacker can trick the victim to follow a specially crafted link and execute arbitrary HTML and script code in user's browser in context of vulnerable website to steal potentially sensitive information, change appearance of the web page, can perform phishing and drive-by-download attacks.\n\n- CVE-2022-36325: Affected devices do not properly sanitize data introduced by an user when rendering the web interface. This could allow an authenticated remote attacker with administrative privileges to inject code and lead to a DOM-based XSS.\n\n- CVE-2022-4029: The Simple:Press plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the 'sforum_[md5 hash of the WordPress URL]' cookie value in versions up to, and including, 6.8 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link. This would be highly complex to exploit as it would require the attacker to set the cookie a cookie for the targeted user.\n\n- CVE-2022-24720: image_processing is an image processing wrapper for libvips and ImageMagick/GraphicsMagick. Prior to version 1.12.2, using the `#apply` method from image_processing to apply a series of operations that are coming from unsanitized user input allows the attacker to execute shell commands. This method is called internally by Active Storage variants, so Active Storage is vulnerable as well. The vulnerability has been fixed in version 1.12.2 of image_processing. As a workaround, users who process based on user input should always sanitize the user input by allowing only a constrained set of operations.\n\n- CVE-2021-25296: Nagios XI version xi-5.7.5 is affected by OS command injection. The vulnerability exists in the file /usr/local/nagiosxi/html/includes/configwizards/windowswmi/windowswmi.inc.php due to improper sanitization of authenticated user-controlled input by a single HTTP request, which can lead to OS command injection on the Nagios XI server.\n\n- CVE-2021-25297: Nagios XI version xi-5.7.5 is affected by OS command injection. The vulnerability exists in the file /usr/local/nagiosxi/html/includes/configwizards/switch/switch.inc.php due to improper sanitization of authenticated user-controlled input by a single HTTP request, which can lead to OS command injection on the Nagios XI server.\n\n- CVE-2021-25298: Nagios XI version xi-5.7.5 is affected by OS command injection. The vulnerability exists in the file /usr/local/nagiosxi/html/includes/configwizards/cloud-vm/cloud-vm.inc.php due to improper sanitization of authenticated user-controlled input by a single HTTP request, which can lead to OS command injection on the Nagios XI server.\n\n- CVE-2021-27101: Accellion FTA 9_12_370 and earlier is affected by SQL injection via a crafted Host header in a request to document_root.html. The fixed version is FTA_9_12_380 and later.\n\n- CVE-2021-35394: Realtek Jungle SDK version v2.x up to v3.4.14B provides a diagnostic tool called 'MP Daemon' that is usually compiled as 'UDPServer' binary. The binary is affected by multiple memory corruption vulnerabilities and an arbitrary command injection vulnerability that can be exploited by remote unauthenticated attackers.\n\n- CVE-2022-26352: An issue was discovered in the ContentResource API in dotCMS 3.0 through 22.02. Attackers can craft a multipart form request to post a file whose filename is not initially sanitized. This allows directory traversal, in which the file is saved outside of the intended storage location. If anonymous content creation is enabled, this allows an unauthenticated attacker to upload an executable file, such as a .jsp file, that can lead to remote code execution.\n\n- CVE-2022-27926: A reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the /public/launchNewWindow.jsp component of Zimbra Collaboration (aka ZCS) 9.0 allows unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary web script or HTML via request parameters.\n\n- CVE-2022-22221: An Improper Neutralization of Special Elements vulnerability in the download manager of Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series and EX Series allows a locally authenticated attacker with low privileges to take full control over the device. One aspect of this vulnerability is that the attacker needs to be able to execute any of the \"request ...\" or \"show system download ...\" commands. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series and EX Series: All versions prior to 19.2R1-S9, 19.2R3-S5; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R3-S6; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R3-S8; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R3-S4; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R3-S4; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R3-S3; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R3-S2, 20.4R3-S3; 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R3-S1; 21.2 versions prior to 21.2R2-S2, 21.2R3; 21.3 versions prior to 21.3R2, 21.3R3; 21.4 versions prior to 21.4R1-S1, 21.4R2.\n\n- CVE-2022-3047: Insufficient policy enforcement in Extensions API in Google Chrome prior to 105.0.5195.52 allowed an attacker who convinced a user to install a malicious extension to bypass downloads policy via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2022-21705: Octobercms is a self-hosted CMS platform based on the Laravel PHP Framework. In affected versions user input was not properly sanitized before rendering. An authenticated user with the permissions to create, modify and delete website pages can exploit this vulnerability to bypass `cms.safe_mode` / `cms.enableSafeMode` in order to execute arbitrary code. This issue only affects admin panels that rely on safe mode and restricted permissions. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must first have access to the backend area. The issue has been patched in Build 474 (v1.0.474) and v1.1.10. Users unable to upgrade should apply https://github.com/octobercms/library/commit/c393c5ce9ca2c5acc3ed6c9bb0dab5ffd61965fe to your installation manually.\n\n- CVE-2022-24039: A vulnerability has been identified in Desigo PXC4 (All versions < V02.20.142.10-10884), Desigo PXC5 (All versions < V02.20.142.10-10884). The \u201caddCell\u201d JavaScript function fails to properly sanitize user-controllable input before including it into the generated XML body of the XLS report document, such that it is possible to inject arbitrary content (e.g., XML tags) into the generated file. An attacker with restricted privileges, by poisoning any of the content used to generate XLS reports, could be able to leverage the application to deliver malicious files against higher-privileged users and obtain Remote Code Execution (RCE) against the administrator\u2019s workstation.\n\n- CVE-2022-35948: undici is an HTTP/1.1 client, written from scratch for Node.js.`=< undici@5.8.0` users are vulnerable to _CRLF Injection_ on headers when using unsanitized input as request headers, more specifically, inside the `content-type` header. Example: ``` import { request } from 'undici' const unsanitizedContentTypeInput = 'application/json\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nGET /foo2 HTTP/1.1' await request('http://localhost:3000, { method: 'GET', headers: { 'content-type': unsanitizedContentTypeInput }, }) ``` The above snippet will perform two requests in a single `request` API call: 1) `http://localhost:3000/` 2) `http://localhost:3000/foo2` This issue was patched in Undici v5.8.1. Sanitize input when sending content-type headers using user input as a workaround.\n\n- CVE-2021-24942: The Menu Item Visibility Control WordPress plugin through 0.5 doesn't sanitize and validate the \"Visibility logic\" option for WordPress menu items, which could allow highly privileged users to execute arbitrary PHP code even in a hardened environment.\n\n- CVE-2022-0819: Code Injection in GitHub repository dolibarr/dolibarr prior to 15.0.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-25644: All versions of package @pendo324/get-process-by-name are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code Execution due to improper sanitization of getProcessByName function.\n\n- CVE-2022-46161: pdfmake is an open source client/server side PDF printing in pure JavaScript. In versions up to and including 0.2.5 pdfmake contains an unsafe evaluation of user controlled input. Users of pdfmake are thus subject to arbitrary code execution in the context of the process running the pdfmake code. There are no known fixes for this issue. Users are advised to restrict access to trusted user input.\n\n- CVE-2022-46836: PHP code injection in watolib auth.php and hosttags.php in Tribe29's Checkmk <= 2.1.0p10, Checkmk <= 2.0.0p27, and Checkmk <= 1.6.0p29 allows an attacker to inject and execute PHP code which will be executed upon request of the vulnerable component.\n\n- CVE-2021-33360: An issue found in Stoqey gnuplot v.0.0.3 and earlier allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via the src/index.ts, plotCallack, child_process, and/or filePath parameter(s).\n\n- CVE-2022-0764: Arbitrary Command Injection in GitHub repository strapi/strapi prior to 4.1.0.\n\n- CVE-2022-21129: Versions of the package nemo-appium before 0.0.9 are vulnerable to Command Injection due to improper input sanitization in the 'module.exports.setup' function. **Note:** In order to exploit this vulnerability appium-running 0.1.3 has to be installed as one of nemo-appium dependencies. \n\n- CVE-2022-21165: All versions of package font-converter are vulnerable to Arbitrary Command Injection due to missing sanitization of input that potentially flows into the child_process.exec() function.\n\n- CVE-2022-21186: The package @acrontum/filesystem-template before 0.0.2 are vulnerable to Arbitrary Command Injection due to the fetchRepo API missing sanitization of the href field of external input.\n\n- CVE-2022-21191: Versions of the package global-modules-path before 3.0.0 are vulnerable to Command Injection due to missing input sanitization or other checks and sandboxes being employed to the getPath function. \n\n- CVE-2022-2143: The affected product is vulnerable to two instances of command injection, which may allow an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code.\n\n- CVE-2022-21810: All versions of the package smartctl are vulnerable to Command Injection via the info method due to improper input sanitization. \n\n- CVE-2022-25350: All versions of the package puppet-facter are vulnerable to Command Injection via the getFact function due to improper input sanitization. \n\n- CVE-2022-25853: All versions of the package semver-tags are vulnerable to Command Injection via the getGitTagsRemote function due to improper input sanitization. \n\n- CVE-2022-25855: All versions of the package create-choo-app3 are vulnerable to Command Injection via the devInstall function due to improper user-input sanitization. \n\n- CVE-2022-25890: All versions of the package wifey are vulnerable to Command Injection via the connect() function due to improper input sanitization. \n\n- CVE-2022-25908: All versions of the package create-choo-electron are vulnerable to Command Injection via the devInstall function due to improper user-input sanitization. \n\n- CVE-2022-25916: Versions of the package mt7688-wiscan before 0.8.3 are vulnerable to Command Injection due to improper input sanitization in the 'wiscan.scan' function. \n\n- CVE-2022-25923: Versions of the package exec-local-bin before 1.2.0 are vulnerable to Command Injection via the theProcess() functionality due to improper user-input sanitization. \n\n- CVE-2022-25926: Versions of the package window-control before 1.4.5 are vulnerable to Command Injection via the sendKeys function, due to improper input sanitization. \n\n- CVE-2022-25962: All versions of the package vagrant.js are vulnerable to Command Injection via the boxAdd function due to improper input sanitization. \n\n- CVE-2022-3275: Command injection is possible in the puppetlabs-apt module prior to version 9.0.0.

In versions prior to 1.3.0 there exists a DoS vulnerability that is possible due to a bug in the library that would allow an attacker with specifically designed queries to cause stack overflow panics. Any user with access to the GraphQL handler can send these queries and cause stack overflows. This in turn could potentially compromise the ability of the server to serve data to its users. The issue has been patched in version `v1.3.0`. The only known workaround for this issue is to disable the `graphql.MaxDepth` option from your schema which is not recommended.\n\n- CVE-2022-23591: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The `GraphDef` format in TensorFlow does not allow self recursive functions. The runtime assumes that this invariant is satisfied. However, a `GraphDef` containing a fragment such as the following can be consumed when loading a `SavedModel`. This would result in a stack overflow during execution as resolving each `NodeDef` means resolving the function itself and its nodes. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2022-24675: encoding/pem in Go before 1.17.9 and 1.18.x before 1.18.1 has a Decode stack overflow via a large amount of PEM data.\n\n- CVE-2022-31019: Vapor is a server-side Swift HTTP web framework. When using automatic content decoding an attacker can craft a request body that can make the server crash with the following request: `curl -d \"array[_0][0][array][_0][0][array]$(for f in $(seq 1100); do echo -n '[_0][0][array]'; done)[string][_0]=hello%20world\" http://localhost:8080/foo`. The issue is unbounded, attacker controlled stack growth which will at some point lead to a stack overflow and a process crash. This issue has been fixed in version 4.61.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-31099: rulex is a new, portable, regular expression language. When parsing untrusted rulex expressions, the stack may overflow, possibly enabling a Denial of Service attack. This happens when parsing an expression with several hundred levels of nesting, causing the process to abort immediately. This is a security concern for you, if your service parses untrusted rulex expressions (expressions provided by an untrusted user), and your service becomes unavailable when the process running rulex aborts due to a stack overflow. The crash is fixed in version **0.4.3**. Affected users are advised to update to this version. There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-3216: A vulnerability has been found in Nintendo Game Boy Color and classified as problematic.

VDB-208606 is the identifier assigned to this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2022-38334: XPDF v4.04 and earlier was discovered to contain a stack overflow via the function Catalog::countPageTree() at Catalog.cc.\n\n- CVE-2022-41966: XStream serializes Java objects to XML and back again. Versions prior to 1.4.20 may allow a remote attacker to terminate the application with a stack overflow error, resulting in a denial of service only via manipulation the processed input stream. The attack uses the hash code implementation for collections and maps to force recursive hash calculation causing a stack overflow. This issue is patched in version 1.4.20 which handles the stack overflow and raises an InputManipulationException instead. A potential workaround for users who only use HashMap or HashSet and whose XML refers these only as default map or set, is to change the default implementation of java.util.Map and java.util per the code example in the referenced advisory. However, this implies that your application does not care about the implementation of the map and all elements are comparable.\n\n- CVE-2022-47662: GPAC MP4Box 2.1-DEV-rev649-ga8f438d20 has a segment fault (/stack overflow) due to infinite recursion in Media_GetSample isomedia/media.c:662\n\n- CVE-2022-23460: Jsonxx or Json++ is a JSON parser, writer and reader written in C++.

Web applications often mistakenly make the assumption that data passed to the client in hidden fields or cookies is not susceptible to tampering. Improper validation of data that are user-controllable can lead to the application processing incorrect, and often malicious, input.\n\n\nFor example, custom cookies commonly store session data or persistent data across sessions. This kind of session data is normally involved in security related decisions on the server side, such as user authentication and access control. Thus, the cookies might contain sensitive data such as user credentials and privileges.

This causes the product to appear to be the source of the request, leading it to act as a proxy or other intermediary between the upstream component and the external actor.\n\nExtended Details:\n\n\n\nIf an attacker cannot directly contact a target, but the product has access to the target, then the attacker can send a request to the product and have it be forwarded to the target. The request would appear to be coming from the product's system, not the attacker's system. As a result, the attacker can bypass access controls (such as firewalls) or hide the source of malicious requests, since the requests would not be coming directly from the attacker.\n\n\nSince proxy functionality and message-forwarding often serve a legitimate purpose, this issue only becomes a vulnerability when:\n\n\n  - The product runs with different privileges or on a different system, or otherwise has different levels of access than the upstream component;\n\n  - The attacker is prevented from making the request directly to the target; and\n\n  - The attacker can create a request that the proxy does not explicitly intend to be forwarded on the behalf of the requester. Such a request might point to an unexpected hostname, port number, hardware IP, or service. Or, the request might be sent to an allowed service, but the request could contain disallowed directives, commands, or resources.\n\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-1999-0017: FTP bounce attack. The design of the protocol allows an attacker to modify the PORT command to cause the FTP server to connect to other machines besides the attacker's.\n\n- CVE-1999-0168: RPC portmapper could redirect service requests from an attacker to another entity, which thinks the requests came from the portmapper.\n\n- CVE-2005-0315: FTP server does not ensure that the IP address in a PORT command is the same as the FTP user's session, allowing port scanning by proxy.\n\n- CVE-2002-1484: Web server allows attackers to request a URL from another server, including other ports, which allows proxied scanning.\n\n- CVE-2004-2061: CGI script accepts and retrieves incoming URLs.\n\n- CVE-2001-1484: Bounce attack allows access to TFTP from trusted side.\n\n- CVE-2010-1637: Web-based mail program allows internal network scanning using a modified POP3 port number.\n\n- CVE-2009-0037: URL-downloading library automatically follows redirects to file:// and scp:// URLs\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-0383: In done of CaptivePortalLoginActivity.java, there is a confused deputy.

BLS signature validation in lotus uses blst library method VerifyCompressed. This method accepts signatures in 2 forms: \"serialized\", and \"compressed\", meaning that BLS signatures can be provided as either of 2 unique byte arrays. Lotus block validation functions perform a uniqueness check on provided blocks. Two blocks are considered distinct if the CIDs of their blockheader do not match. The CID method for blockheader includes the BlockSig of the block. The result of these issues is that it would be possible to punish miners for valid blocks, as there are two different valid block CIDs available for each block, even though this must be unique. By switching from the go based `blst` bindings over to the bindings in `filecoin-ffi`, the code paths now ensure that all signatures are compressed by size and the way they are deserialized. This happened in https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/5393.\n\n- CVE-2020-23533: Union Pay up to 1.2.0, for web based versions contains a CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature vulnerability, allows attackers to shop for free in merchants' websites and mobile apps, via a crafted authentication code (MAC) which is generated based on a secret key which is NULL.\n\n- CVE-2021-0152: Improper verification of cryptographic signature in the installer for some Intel(R) Wireless Bluetooth(R) and Killer(TM) Bluetooth(R) products in Windows 10 may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable denial of service via local access.\n\n- CVE-2021-21238: PySAML2 is a pure python implementation of SAML Version 2 Standard. PySAML2 before 6.5.0 has an improper verification of cryptographic signature vulnerability. All users of pysaml2 that need to validate signed SAML documents are impacted. The vulnerability is a variant of XML Signature wrapping because it did not validate the SAML document against an XML schema. This allowed invalid XML documents to be processed and such a document can trick pysaml2 with a wrapped signature. This is fixed in PySAML2 6.5.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-21239: PySAML2 is a pure python implementation of SAML Version 2 Standard. PySAML2 before 6.5.0 has an improper verification of cryptographic signature vulnerability. Users of pysaml2 that use the default CryptoBackendXmlSec1 backend and need to verify signed SAML documents are impacted. PySAML2 does not ensure that a signed SAML document is correctly signed. The default CryptoBackendXmlSec1 backend is using the xmlsec1 binary to verify the signature of signed SAML documents, but by default xmlsec1 accepts any type of key found within the given document. xmlsec1 needs to be configured explicitly to only use only _x509 certificates_ for the verification process of the SAML document signature. This is fixed in PySAML2 6.5.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-22708: A CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature vulnerability exists in EVlink City (EVC1S22P4 / EVC1S7P4 all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1), EVlink Parking (EVW2 / EVF2 / EV.2 all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1), and EVlink Smart Wallbox (EVB1A all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1 ) that could allow an attacker to craft a malicious firmware package and bypass the signature verification mechanism.\n\n- CVE-2021-22734: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature vulnerability exists in homeLYnk (Wiser For KNX) and spaceLYnk V2.60 and prior which could cause remote code execution when an attacker loads unauthorized code.\n\n- CVE-2021-22735: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature vulnerability exists inhomeLYnk (Wiser For KNX) and spaceLYnk V2.60 and prior which could allow remote code execution when unauthorized code is copied to the device.\n\n- CVE-2021-28091: Lasso all versions prior to 2.7.0 has improper verification of a cryptographic signature.\n\n- CVE-2021-3033: An improper verification of cryptographic signature vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks Prisma Cloud Compute console.

In versions prior to 7.0.3, the `verifyWithMessage` method of `tEnvoyNaClSigningKey` always returns `true` for any signature that has a SHA-512 hash matching the SHA-512 hash of the message even if the signature was invalid. This issue is patched in version 7.0.3. As a workaround: In `tenvoy.js` under the `verifyWithMessage` method definition within the `tEnvoyNaClSigningKey` class, ensure that the return statement call to `this.verify` ends in `.verified`.\n\n- CVE-2021-32738: js-stellar-sdk is a Javascript library for communicating with a Stellar Horizon server. The `Utils.readChallengeTx` function used in SEP-10 Stellar Web Authentication states in its function documentation that it reads and validates the challenge transaction including verifying that the `serverAccountID` has signed the transaction. In js-stellar-sdk before version 8.2.3, the function does not verify that the server has signed the transaction. Applications that also used `Utils.verifyChallengeTxThreshold` or `Utils.verifyChallengeTxSigners` to verify the signatures including the server signature on the challenge transaction are unaffected as those functions verify the server signed the transaction. Applications calling `Utils.readChallengeTx` should update to version 8.2.3, the first version with a patch for this vulnerability, to ensure that the challenge transaction is completely valid and signed by the server creating the challenge transaction.\n\n- CVE-2021-37927: Zoho ManageEngine ADManager Plus version 7110 and prior allows account takeover via SSO.\n\n- CVE-2021-29108: There is an privilege escalation vulnerability in organization-specific logins in Esri Portal for ArcGIS versions 10.9 and below that may allow a remote, authenticated attacker who is able to intercept and modify a SAML assertion to impersonate another account (XML Signature Wrapping Attack). In addition patching, Esri also strongly recommends as best practice for SAML assertions to be signed and encrypted.\n\n- CVE-2021-20156: Trendnet AC2600 TEW-827DRU version 2.08B01 contains an improper access control configuration that could allow for a malicious firmware update. It is possible to manually install firmware that may be malicious in nature as there does not appear to be any signature validation done to determine if it is from a known and trusted source. This includes firmware updates that are done via the automated \"check for updates\" in the admin interface. If an attacker is able to masquerade as the update server, the device will not verify that the firmware updates downloaded are legitimate.\n\n- CVE-2020-1464: A spoofing vulnerability exists when Windows incorrectly validates file signatures. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could bypass security features and load improperly signed files. In an attack scenario, an attacker could bypass security features intended to prevent improperly signed files from being loaded. The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Windows validates file signatures. \n\n- CVE-2020-2021: When Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) authentication is enabled and the 'Validate Identity Provider Certificate' option is disabled (unchecked), improper verification of signatures in PAN-OS SAML authentication enables an unauthenticated network-based attacker to access protected resources. The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable server to exploit this vulnerability. This issue affects PAN-OS 9.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.1.3; PAN-OS 9.0 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.0.9; PAN-OS 8.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 8.1.15, and all versions of PAN-OS 8.0 (EOL). This issue does not affect PAN-OS 7.1. This issue cannot be exploited if SAML is not used for authentication. This issue cannot be exploited if the 'Validate Identity Provider Certificate' option is enabled (checked) in the SAML Identity Provider Server Profile. Resources that can be protected by SAML-based single sign-on (SSO) authentication are: GlobalProtect Gateway, GlobalProtect Portal, GlobalProtect Clientless VPN, Authentication and Captive Portal, PAN-OS next-generation firewalls (PA-Series, VM-Series) and Panorama web interfaces, Prisma Access In the case of GlobalProtect Gateways, GlobalProtect Portal, Clientless VPN, Captive Portal, and Prisma Access, an unauthenticated attacker with network access to the affected servers can gain access to protected resources if allowed by configured authentication and Security policies. There is no impact on the integrity and availability of the gateway, portal or VPN server. An attacker cannot inspect or tamper with sessions of regular users. In the worst case, this is a critical severity vulnerability with a CVSS Base Score of 10.0 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N). In the case of PAN-OS and Panorama web interfaces, this issue allows an unauthenticated attacker with network access to the PAN-OS or Panorama web interfaces to log in as an administrator and perform administrative actions. In the worst-case scenario, this is a critical severity vulnerability with a CVSS Base Score of 10.0 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H). If the web interfaces are only accessible to a restricted management network, then the issue is lowered to a CVSS Base Score of 9.6 (CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H). Palo Alto Networks is not aware of any malicious attempts to exploit this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2021-32977: AVEVA System Platform versions 2017 through 2020 R2 P01 does not verify, or incorrectly verifies, the cryptographic signature for data.\n\n- CVE-2021-35097: Possible authentication bypass due to improper order of signature verification and hashing in the signature verification call in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Mobile, Snapdragon Voice & Music, Snapdragon Wearables\n\n- CVE-2021-35113: Possible authentication bypass due to improper order of signature verification and hashing in the signature verification call in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Mobile, Snapdragon Wearables\n\n- CVE-2021-36277: Dell Command | Update, Dell Update, and Alienware Update versions before 4.3 contains an Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature Vulnerability. A local authenticated malicious user may exploit this vulnerability by executing arbitrary code on the system.\n\n- CVE-2021-43074: An improper verification of cryptographic signature vulnerability [CWE-347] in FortiWeb 6.4 all versions, 6.3.16 and below, 6.2 all versions, 6.1 all versions, 6.0 all versions; FortiOS 7.0.3 and below, 6.4.8 and below, 6.2 all versions, 6.0 all versions; FortiSwitch 7.0.3 and below, 6.4.10 and below, 6.2 all versions, 6.0 all versions; FortiProxy 7.0.1 and below, 2.0.7 and below, 1.2 all versions, 1.1 all versions, 1.0 all versions may allow an attacker to decrypt portions of the administrative session management cookie if able to intercept the latter.\n\n- CVE-2022-1739: The tested version of Dominion Voting Systems ImageCast X does not validate application signatures to a trusted root certificate. Use of a trusted root certificate ensures software installed on a device is traceable to, or verifiable against, a cryptographic key provided by the manufacturer to detect tampering. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to install malicious code, which could also be spread to other vulnerable ImageCast X devices via removable media.\n\n- CVE-2022-20929: A vulnerability in the upgrade signature verification of Cisco Enterprise NFV Infrastructure Software (NFVIS) could allow an unauthenticated, local attacker to provide an unauthentic upgrade file for upload. This vulnerability is due to insufficient cryptographic signature verification of upgrade files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing an administrator with an unauthentic upgrade file. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to fully compromise the Cisco NFVIS system.\n\n- CVE-2022-23507: Tendermint is a high-performance blockchain consensus engine for Byzantine fault tolerant applications. Versions prior to 0.28.0 contain a potential attack via Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature, affecting anyone using the tendermint-light-client and related packages to perform light client verification (e.g. IBC-rs, Hermes). The light client does not check that the chain IDs of the trusted and untrusted headers match, resulting in a possible attack vector where someone who finds a header from an untrusted chain that satisfies all other verification conditions (e.g. enough overlapping validator signatures) could fool a light client. The attack vector is currently theoretical, and no proof-of-concept exists yet to exploit it on live networks. This issue is patched in version 0.28.0. There are no workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-24759: `@chainsafe/libp2p-noise` contains TypeScript implementation of noise protocol, an encryption protocol used in libp2p. `@chainsafe/libp2p-noise` before 4.1.2 and 5.0.3 does not correctly validate signatures during the handshake process. This may allow a man-in-the-middle to pose as other peers and get those peers banned. Users should upgrade to version 4.1.2 or 5.0.3 to receive a patch. There are currently no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-25898: The package jsrsasign before 10.5.25 are vulnerable to Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature when JWS or JWT signature with non Base64URL encoding special characters or number escaped characters may be validated as valid by mistake. Workaround: Validate JWS or JWT signature if it has Base64URL and dot safe string before executing JWS.verify() or JWS.verifyJWT() method.\n\n- CVE-2022-2790: Emerson Electric's Proficy Machine Edition Version 9.00 and prior is vulenrable to CWE-347 Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature, and does not properly verify compiled logic (PDT files) and data blocks data (BLD/BLK files).\n\n- CVE-2022-31156: Gradle is a build tool. Dependency verification is a security feature in Gradle Build Tool that was introduced to allow validation of external dependencies either through their checksum or cryptographic signatures. In versions 6.2 through 7.4.2, there are some cases in which Gradle may skip that verification and accept a dependency that would otherwise fail the build as an untrusted external artifact. This can occur in two ways. When signature verification is disabled but the verification metadata contains entries for dependencies that only have a `gpg` element but no `checksum` element. When signature verification is enabled, the verification metadata contains entries for dependencies with a `gpg` element but there is no signature file on the remote repository. In both cases, the verification will accept the dependency, skipping signature verification and not complaining that the dependency has no checksum entry. For builds that are vulnerable, there are two risks. Gradle could download a malicious binary from a repository outside your organization due to name squatting. For those still using HTTP only and not HTTPS for downloading dependencies, the build could download a malicious library instead of the expected one. Gradle 7.5 patches this issue by making sure to run checksum verification if signature verification cannot be completed, whatever the reason. Two workarounds are available: Remove all `gpg` elements from dependency verification metadata if you disable signature validation and/or avoid adding `gpg` entries for dependencies that do not have signature files.\n\n- CVE-2022-31206: The Omron SYSMAC Nx product family PLCs (NJ series, NY series, NX series, and PMAC series) through 2022-005-18 lack cryptographic authentication. These PLCs are programmed using the SYMAC Studio engineering software (which compiles IEC 61131-3 conformant POU code to native machine code for execution by the PLC's runtime). The resulting machine code is executed by a runtime, typically controlled by a real-time operating system. The logic that is downloaded to the PLC does not seem to be cryptographically authenticated, allowing an attacker to manipulate transmitted object code to the PLC and execute arbitrary machine code on the processor of the PLC's CPU module in the context of the runtime. In the case of at least the NJ series, an RTOS and hardware combination is used that would potentially allow for memory protection and privilege separation and thus limit the impact of code execution. However, it was not confirmed whether these sufficiently segment the runtime from the rest of the RTOS.\n\n- CVE-2022-31207: The Omron SYSMAC Cx product family PLCs (CS series, CJ series, and CP series) through 2022-05-18 lack cryptographic authentication. They utilize the Omron FINS (9600/TCP) protocol for engineering purposes, including downloading projects and control logic to the PLC. This protocol has authentication flaws as reported in FSCT-2022-0057. Control logic is downloaded to PLC volatile memory using the FINS Program Area Read and Program Area Write commands or to non-volatile memory using other commands from where it can be loaded into volatile memory for execution. The logic that is loaded into and executed from the user program area exists in compiled object code form. Upon execution, these object codes are first passed to a dedicated ASIC that determines whether the object code is to be executed by the ASIC or the microprocessor. In the former case, the object code is interpreted by the ASIC whereas in the latter case the object code is passed to the microprocessor for object code interpretation by a ROM interpreter. In the abnormal case where the object code cannot be handled by either, an abnormal condition is triggered and the PLC is halted. The logic that is downloaded to the PLC does not seem to be cryptographically authenticated, thus allowing an attacker to manipulate transmitted object code to the PLC and either execute arbitrary object code commands on the ASIC or on the microprocessor interpreter.\n\n- CVE-2022-34459:  Dell Command | Update, Dell Update, and Alienware Update versions prior to 4.7 contain a improper verification of cryptographic signature in get applicable driver component. A local malicious user could potentially exploit this vulnerability leading to malicious payload execution. \n\n- CVE-2022-39366: DataHub is an open-source metadata platform. Prior to version 0.8.45, the `StatelessTokenService` of the DataHub metadata service (GMS) does not verify the signature of JWT tokens. This allows an attacker to connect to DataHub instances as any user if Metadata Service authentication is enabled. This vulnerability occurs because the `StatelessTokenService` of the Metadata service uses the `parse` method of `io.jsonwebtoken.JwtParser`, which does not perform a verification of the cryptographic token signature. This means that JWTs are accepted regardless of the used algorithm. This issue may lead to an authentication bypass. Version 0.8.45 contains a patch for the issue. There are no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-41666: A CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature vulnerability exists that allows adversaries with local user privileges to load a malicious DLL which could lead to execution of malicious code. Affected Products: EcoStruxure Operator Terminal Expert(V3.3 Hotfix 1 or prior), Pro-face BLUE(V3.3 Hotfix1 or prior).\n\n- CVE-2022-41669: A CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature vulnerability exists in the SGIUtility component that allows adversaries with local user privileges to load a malicious DLL which could result in execution of malicious code. Affected Products: EcoStruxure Operator Terminal Expert(V3.3 Hotfix 1 or prior), Pro-face BLUE(V3.3 Hotfix1 or prior).\n\n- CVE-2021-23993: An attacker may perform a DoS attack to prevent a user from sending encrypted email to a correspondent. If an attacker creates a crafted OpenPGP key with a subkey that has an invalid self signature, and the Thunderbird user imports the crafted key, then Thunderbird may try to use the invalid subkey, but the RNP library rejects it from being used, causing encryption to fail. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 78.9.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-23540: In versions `<=8.5.1` of `jsonwebtoken` library, lack of algorithm definition in the `jwt.verify()` function can lead to signature validation bypass due to defaulting to the `none` algorithm for signature verification. Users are affected if you do not specify algorithms in the `jwt.verify()` function. This issue has been fixed, please update to version 9.0.0 which removes the default support for the none algorithm in the `jwt.verify()` method. There will be no impact, if you update to version 9.0.0 and you don\u2019t need to allow for the `none` algorithm. If you need 'none' algorithm, you have to explicitly specify that in `jwt.verify()` options. \n\n- CVE-2022-42793: An issue in code signature validation was addressed with improved checks. This issue is fixed in macOS Big Sur 11.7, macOS Ventura 13, iOS 16, iOS 15.7 and iPadOS 15.7, macOS Monterey 12.6. An app may be able to bypass code signing checks.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-345 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-345 (ChildOf)",

Sending such a request would move the post to the trash, and repeating the request would permanently delete the post in question.\n\n- CVE-2021-1143: A vulnerability in Cisco Connected Mobile Experiences (CMX) API authorizations could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to enumerate what users exist on the system. The vulnerability is due to a lack of authorization checks for certain API GET requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specific API GET requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to enumerate users of the CMX system.\n\n- CVE-2021-20283: The web service responsible for fetching other users' enrolled courses did not validate that the requesting user had permission to view that information in each course in moodle before 3.10.2, 3.9.5, 3.8.8, 3.5.17.\n\n- CVE-2021-21481: The MigrationService, which is part of SAP NetWeaver versions 7.10, 7.11, 7.20, 7.30, 7.31, 7.40, 7.50, does not perform an authorization check. This might allow an unauthorized attacker to access configuration objects, including such that grant administrative privileges. This could result in complete compromise of system confidentiality, integrity, and availability.\n\n- CVE-2021-27509: In Visualware MyConnection Server before 11.0b build 5382, each published report is not associated with its own access code.\n\n- CVE-2021-34647: The Ninja Forms WordPress plugin is vulnerable to sensitive information disclosure via the bulk_export_submissions function found in the ~/includes/Routes/Submissions.php file, in versions up to and including 3.5.7. This allows authenticated attackers to export all Ninja Forms submissions data via the /ninja-forms-submissions/export REST API which can include personally identifiable information.\n\n- CVE-2021-34648: The Ninja Forms WordPress plugin is vulnerable to arbitrary email sending via the trigger_email_action function found in the ~/includes/Routes/Submissions.php file, in versions up to and including 3.5.7. This allows authenticated attackers to send arbitrary emails from the affected server via the /ninja-forms-submissions/email-action REST API which can be used to socially engineer victims.\n\n- CVE-2021-36909: Authenticated Database Reset vulnerability in WordPress WP Reset PRO Premium plugin (versions <= 5.98) allows any authenticated user to wipe the entire database regardless of their authorization. It leads to a complete website reset and takeover.\n\n- CVE-2021-38698: HashiCorp Consul and Consul Enterprise 1.10.1 Txn.Apply endpoint allowed services to register proxies for other services, enabling access to service traffic. Fixed in 1.8.15, 1.9.9 and 1.10.2.\n\n- CVE-2021-39232: In Apache Ozone versions prior to 1.2.0, certain admin related SCM commands can be executed by any authenticated users, not just by admins.\n\n- CVE-2021-40884: Projectsend version r1295 is affected by sensitive information disclosure. Because of not checking authorization in ids parameter in files-edit.php and id parameter in process.php function, a user with uploader role can download and edit all files of users in application.\n\n- CVE-2021-41554: ARCHIBUS Web Central 21.3.3.815 (a version from 2014) does not properly validate requests for access to data and functionality in these affected endpoints: /archibus/schema/ab-edit-users.axvw, /archibus/schema/ab-data-dictionary-table.axvw, /archibus/schema/ab-schema-add-field.axvw, /archibus/schema/ab-core/views/process-navigator/ab-my-user-profile.axvw. By not verifying the permissions for access to resources, it allows a potential attacker to view pages that are not allowed. Specifically, it was found that any authenticated user can reach the administrative console for user management by directly requesting access to the page via URL. This allows a malicious user to modify all users' profiles, to elevate any privileges to administrative ones, or to create or delete any type of user. It is also possible to modify the emails of other users, through a misconfiguration of the username parameter, on the user profile page. This is fixed in all recent versions, such as version 26. NOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer. Version 21.3 was officially de-supported by the end of 2020\n\n- CVE-2021-1506: Multiple vulnerabilities in Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or gain access to sensitive information, or allow an authenticated, local attacker to gain escalated privileges or gain unauthorized access to the application.

Refer to the referenced GitHub Security Advisory for complete details. This is fixed in version 0.7.5.\n\n- CVE-2021-32748: Nextcloud Richdocuments in an open source self hosted online office. Nextcloud uses the WOPI (\"Web Application Open Platform Interface\") protocol to communicate with the Collabora Editor, the communication between these two services was not protected by a credentials or IP check. Whilst this does not result in gaining access to data that the user has not yet access to, it can result in a bypass of any enforced watermark on documents as described on the [Nextcloud Virtual Data Room](https://nextcloud.com/virtual-data-room/) website and [our documentation](https://portal.nextcloud.com/article/nextcloud-and-virtual-data-room-configuration-59.html). The Nextcloud Richdocuments releases 3.8.3 and 4.2.0 add an additional admin settings for an allowlist of IP addresses that can access the WOPI API. We recommend upgrading and configuring the allowlist to a list of Collabora servers. There is no known workaround. Note that this primarily results a bypass of any configured watermark or download protection using File Access Control. If you do not require or rely on these as a security feature no immediate action is required on your end.\n\n- CVE-2021-3653: A flaw was found in the KVM's AMD code for supporting SVM nested virtualization. The flaw occurs when processing the VMCB (virtual machine control block) provided by the L1 guest to spawn/handle a nested guest (L2). Due to improper validation of the \"int_ctl\" field, this issue could allow a malicious L1 to enable AVIC support (Advanced Virtual Interrupt Controller) for the L2 guest. As a result, the L2 guest would be allowed to read/write physical pages of the host, resulting in a crash of the entire system, leak of sensitive data or potential guest-to-host escape. This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to 5.14-rc7.\n\n- CVE-2021-25409: Improper access in Notification setting prior to SMR JUN-2021 Release 1 allows physically proximate attackers to set arbitrary notification via physically configuring device.\n\n- CVE-2021-24851: The Insert Pages WordPress plugin before 3.7.0 allows users with a role as low as Contributor to access content and metadata from arbitrary posts/pages regardless of their author and status (ie private), using a shortcode.

A malicious actor with network access may exploit this issue causing unauthorised remote code execution on vRealize Business for Cloud Virtual Appliance.\n\n- CVE-2021-27903: An issue was discovered in Craft CMS before 3.6.7. In some circumstances, a potential Remote Code Execution vulnerability existed on sites that did not restrict administrative changes (if an attacker were somehow able to hijack an administrator's session).\n\n- CVE-2021-35413: A remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in course_intro_pdf_import.php of Chamilo LMS v1.11.x allows authenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted .htaccess file.\n\n- CVE-2021-21382: Restund is an open source NAT traversal server. The restund TURN server can be instructed to open a relay to the loopback address range. This allows you to reach any other service running on localhost which you might consider private. In the configuration that we ship (https://github.com/wireapp/ansible-restund/blob/master/templates/restund.conf.j2#L40-L43) the `status` interface of restund is enabled and is listening on `127.0.0.1`.The `status` interface allows users to issue administrative commands to `restund` like listing open relays or draining connections. It would be possible for an attacker to contact the status interface and issue administrative commands by setting `XOR-PEER-ADDRESS` to `127.0.0.1:{{restund_udp_status_port}}` when opening a TURN channel. We now explicitly disallow relaying to loopback addresses, 'any' addresses, link local addresses, and the broadcast address. As a workaround disable the `status` module in your restund configuration. However there might still be other services running on `127.0.0.0/8` that you do not want to have exposed. The `turn` module can be disabled. Restund will still perform STUN and this might already be enough for initiating calls in your environments. TURN is only used as a last resort when other NAT traversal options do not work. One should also make sure that the TURN server is set up with firewall rules so that it cannot relay to other addresses that you don't want the TURN server to relay to. For example other services in the same VPC where the TURN server is running. Ideally TURN servers should be deployed in an isolated fashion where they can only reach what they need to reach to perform their task of assisting NAT-traversal.\n\n- CVE-2021-36917: WordPress Hide My WP plugin (versions <= 6.2.3) can be deactivated by any unauthenticated user. It is possible to retrieve a reset token which can then be used to deactivate the plugin.\n\n- CVE-2021-39184: Electron is a framework for writing cross-platform desktop applications using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. A vulnerability in versions prior to 11.5.0, 12.1.0, and 13.3.0 allows a sandboxed renderer to request a \"thumbnail\" image of an arbitrary file on the user's system. The thumbnail can potentially include significant parts of the original file, including textual data in many cases. Versions 15.0.0-alpha.10, 14.0.0, 13.3.0, 12.1.0, and 11.5.0 all contain a fix for the vulnerability. Two workarounds aside from upgrading are available. One may make the vulnerability significantly more difficult for an attacker to exploit by enabling `contextIsolation` in one's app. One may also disable the functionality of the `createThumbnailFromPath` API if one does not need it.\n\n- CVE-2021-39231: In Apache Ozone versions prior to 1.2.0, Various internal server-to-server RPC endpoints are available for connections, making it possible for an attacker to download raw data from Datanode and Ozone manager and modify Ratis replication configuration.\n\n- CVE-2021-29958: When a download was initiated, the client did not check whether it was in normal or private browsing mode, which led to private mode cookies being shared in normal browsing mode.

All unpatched versions of Argo CD starting with 1.0.0 are vulnerable to an improper access control bug, allowing a malicious user to potentially escalate their privileges to admin-level. Versions starting with 0.8.0 and 0.5.0 contain limited versions of this issue. To perform exploits, an authorized Argo CD user must have push access to an Application's source git or Helm repository or `sync` and `override` access to an Application. Once a user has that access, different exploitation levels are possible depending on their other RBAC privileges. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in Argo CD versions 2.3.2, 2.2.8, and 2.1.14. Some mitigation measures are available but do not serve as a substitute for upgrading. To avoid privilege escalation, limit who has push access to Application source repositories or `sync` + `override` access to Applications; and limit which repositories are available in projects where users have `update` access to Applications. To avoid unauthorized resource inspection/tampering, limit who has `delete`, `get`, or `action` access to Applications.\n\n- CVE-2022-28866: Multiple Improper Access Control was discovered in Nokia AirFrame BMC Web GUI < R18 Firmware v4.13.00.

Sourcegraph prior to version 3.37 is vulnerable to remote code execution in the `gitserver` service. The service acts as a git exec proxy, and fails to properly restrict calling `git config`. This allows an attacker to set the git `core.sshCommand` option, which sets git to use the specified command instead of ssh when they need to connect to a remote system. Exploitation of this vulnerability depends on how Sourcegraph is deployed. An attacker able to make HTTP requests to internal services like gitserver is able to exploit it. This issue is patched in Sourcegraph version 3.37. As a workaround, ensure that requests to gitserver are properly protected.\n\n- CVE-2022-4223: The pgAdmin server includes an HTTP API that is intended to be used to validate the path a user selects to external PostgreSQL utilities such as pg_dump and pg_restore.

            "matched_text": "CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password\n\nType: Variant\n\nStatus: Draft\n\nDescription:\n\nThe product contains a hard-coded password, which it uses for its own inbound authentication or for outbound communication to external components.\n\nExtended Details:\n\n\n\nA hard-coded password typically leads to a significant authentication failure that can be difficult for the system administrator to detect. Once detected, it can be difficult to fix, so the administrator may be forced into disabling the product entirely. There are two main variations:\n\n```\n\t\tInbound: the product contains an authentication mechanism that checks for a hard-coded password.\n\t\tOutbound: the product connects to another system or component, and it contains hard-coded password for connecting to that component.\n```\nIn the Inbound variant, a default administration account is created, and a simple password is hard-coded into the product and associated with that account. This hard-coded password is the same for each installation of the product, and it usually cannot be changed or disabled by system administrators without manually modifying the program, or otherwise patching the product. If the password is ever discovered or published (a common occurrence on the Internet), then anybody with knowledge of this password can access the product. Finally, since all installations of the product will have the same password, even across different organizations, this enables massive attacks such as worms to take place.\n\nThe Outbound variant applies to front-end systems that authenticate with a back-end service. The back-end service may require a fixed password which can be easily discovered. The programmer may simply hard-code those back-end credentials into the front-end product. Any user of that program may be able to extract the password. Client-side systems with hard-coded passwords pose even more of a threat, since the extraction of a password from a binary is usually very simple.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-29964: Distributed Control System (DCS) has hard-coded passwords for local shell access\n\n- CVE-2021-37555: Telnet service for IoT feeder for dogs and cats has hard-coded password [REF-1288]\n\n- CVE-2021-35033: Firmware for a WiFi router uses a hard-coded password for a BusyBox shell, allowing bypass of authentication through the UART port\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-27438: The software contains a hard-coded password it uses for its own inbound authentication or for outbound communication to external components on the Reason DR60 (all firmware versions prior to 02A04.1).\n\n- CVE-2021-34757: Multiple vulnerabilities in Cisco Business 220 Series Smart Switches firmware could allow an attacker with Administrator privileges to access sensitive login credentials or reconfigure the passwords on the user account.

It is possible to define an entity by providing a substitution string in the form of a URI. The XML parser can access the contents of this URI and embed these contents back into the XML document for further processing.\n\n\nBy submitting an XML file that defines an external entity with a file:// URI, an attacker can cause the processing application to read the contents of a local file. For example, a URI such as \"file:///c:/winnt/win.ini\" designates (in Windows) the file C:\\Winnt\\win.ini, or file:///etc/passwd designates the password file in Unix-based systems. Using URIs with other schemes such as http://, the attacker can force the application to make outgoing requests to servers that the attacker cannot reach directly, which can be used to bypass firewall restrictions or hide the source of attacks such as port scanning.\n\n\nOnce the content of the URI is read, it is fed back into the application that is processing the XML. This application may echo back the data (e.g. in an error message), thereby exposing the file contents.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nXXE: An acronym used for the term \"XML eXternal Entities\"\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-610\nChildOf -> CWE-610\nPeerOf -> CWE-441\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** CWE-918 (SSRF) and CWE-611 (XXE) are closely related, because they both involve web-related technologies and can launch outbound requests to unexpected destinations. However, XXE can be performed client-side, or in other contexts in which the software is not acting directly as a server, so the \"Server\" portion of the SSRF acronym does not necessarily apply.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-42745:** Recruiter software allows reading arbitrary files using XXE\n- **CVE-2005-1306:** A browser control can allow remote attackers to determine the existence of files via Javascript containing XML script.\n- **CVE-2012-5656:** XXE during SVG image conversion\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-776: Improper Restriction of Recursive Entity References in DTDs ('XML Entity Expansion')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product uses XML documents and allows their structure to be defined with a Document Type Definition (DTD), but it does not properly control the number of recursive definitions of entities.\n\n### Extended Description\nIf the DTD contains a large number of nested or recursive entities, this can lead to explosive growth of data when parsed, causing a denial of service.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nXEE: XEE is the acronym commonly used for XML Entity Expansion.\nBillion Laughs Attack\nXML Bomb: While the \"XML Bomb\" term was used in the early years of knowledge of this issue, the XEE term seems to be more commonly used.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-674\nChildOf -> CWE-674\nChildOf -> CWE-405\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2008-3281:** XEE in XML-parsing library.\n- **CVE-2011-3288:** XML bomb / XEE in enterprise communication product.\n- **CVE-2011-1755:** \"Billion laughs\" attack in XMPP server daemon.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-941: Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product creates a communication channel to initiate an outgoing request to an actor, but it does not correctly specify the intended destination for that actor.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nAttackers at the destination may be able to spoof trusted servers to steal data or cause a denial of service.\n\n\nThere are at least two distinct weaknesses that can cause the product to communicate with an unintended destination:\n\n\n  - If the product allows an attacker to control which destination is specified, then the attacker can cause it to connect to an untrusted or malicious destination. For example, because UDP is a connectionless protocol, UDP packets can be spoofed by specifying a false source address in the packet; when the server receives the packet and sends a reply, it will specify a destination by using the source of the incoming packet - i.e., the false source. The server can then be tricked into sending traffic to the wrong host, which is effective for hiding the real source of an attack and for conducting a distributed denial of service (DDoS). As another example, server-side request forgery (SSRF) and XML External Entity (XXE) can be used to trick a server into making outgoing requests to hosts that cannot be directly accessed by the attacker due to firewall restrictions.\n\n  - If the product incorrectly specifies the destination, then an attacker who can control this destination might be able to spoof trusted servers. While the most common occurrence is likely due to misconfiguration by an administrator, this can be resultant from other weaknesses. For example, the product might incorrectly parse an e-mail or IP address and send sensitive data to an unintended destination. As another example, an Android application may use a \"sticky broadcast\" to communicate with a receiver for a particular application, but since sticky broadcasts can be processed by *any* receiver, this can allow a malicious application to access restricted data that was only intended for a different application.\n\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-923\nCanPrecede -> CWE-406\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2013-5211:** composite: NTP feature generates large responses (high amplification factor) with spoofed UDP source addresses.\n- **CVE-1999-0513:** Classic \"Smurf\" attack, using spoofed ICMP packets to broadcast addresses.\n- **CVE-1999-1379:** DNS query with spoofed source address causes more traffic to be returned to spoofed address than was sent by the attacker.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n### Extended Description\nMost languages and protocols have their own special elements such as characters and reserved words. These special elements can carry control implications. If product does not prevent external control or influence over the inclusion of such special elements, the control flow of the program may be altered from what was intended. For example, both Unix and Windows interpret the symbol < (\"less than\") as meaning \"read input from a file\".\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-707\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This weakness can be related to interpretation conflicts or interaction errors in intermediaries (such as proxies or application firewalls) when the intermediary's model of an endpoint does not account for protocol-specific special elements.\n\n**[Relationship]** See this entry's children for different types of special elements that have been observed at one point or another. However, it can be difficult to find suitable CVE examples. In an attempt to be complete, CWE includes some types that do not have any associated observed example.\n\n**[Research Gap]** This weakness is probably under-studied for proprietary or custom formats. It is likely that these issues are fairly common in applications that use their own custom format for configuration files, logs, meta-data, messaging, etc. They would only be found by accident or with a focused effort based on an understanding of the format.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2001-0677:** Read arbitrary files from mail client by providing a special MIME header that is internally used to store pathnames for attachments.\n- **CVE-2000-0703:** Setuid program does not cleanse special escape sequence before sending data to a mail program, causing the mail program to process those sequences.\n- **CVE-2003-0020:** Multi-channel issue. Terminal escape sequences not filtered from log files.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-674: Uncontrolled Recursion\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not properly control the amount of recursion that takes place,  consuming excessive resources, such as allocated memory or the program stack.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nStack Exhaustion\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-834\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2007-1285:** Deeply nested arrays trigger stack exhaustion.\n- **CVE-2007-3409:** Self-referencing pointers create infinite loop and resultant stack exhaustion.\n- **CVE-2016-10707:** Javascript application accidentally changes input in a way that prevents a recursive call from detecting an exit condition.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-8: J2EE Misconfiguration: Entity Bean Declared Remote\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nWhen an application exposes a remote interface for an entity bean, it might also expose methods that get or set the bean's data. These methods could be leveraged to read sensitive information, or to change data in ways that violate the application's expectations, potentially leading to other vulnerabilities.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-668\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Other]** Entity beans that expose a remote interface become part of an application's attack surface. For performance reasons, an application should rarely use remote entity beans, so there is a good chance that a remote entity bean declaration is an error.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-827: Improper Control of Document Type Definition\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product does not restrict a reference to a Document Type Definition (DTD) to the intended control sphere. This might allow attackers to reference arbitrary DTDs, possibly causing the product to expose files, consume excessive system resources, or execute arbitrary http requests on behalf of the attacker.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nAs DTDs are processed, they might try to read or include files on the machine performing the parsing. If an attacker is able to control the DTD, then the attacker might be able to specify sensitive resources or requests or provide malicious content.\n\n\nFor example, the SOAP specification prohibits SOAP messages from containing DTDs.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-706\nChildOf -> CWE-829\nCanPrecede -> CWE-776\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2010-2076:** Product does not properly reject DTDs in SOAP messages, which allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files, send HTTP requests to intranet servers, or cause a denial of service.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nIf a web product does not properly protect assumed-immutable values from modification in hidden form fields, parameters, cookies, or URLs, this can lead to modification of critical data. Web applications often mistakenly make the assumption that data passed to the client in hidden fields or cookies is not susceptible to tampering. Improper validation of data that are user-controllable can lead to the application processing incorrect, and often malicious, input.\n\n\nFor example, custom cookies commonly store session data or persistent data across sessions. This kind of session data is normally involved in security related decisions on the server side, such as user authentication and access control. Thus, the cookies might contain sensitive data such as user credentials and privileges. This is a dangerous practice, as it can often lead to improper reliance on the value of the client-provided cookie by the server side application.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nAssumed-Immutable Parameter Tampering\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-642\nChildOf -> CWE-471\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This is a primary weakness for many other weaknesses and functional consequences, including XSS, SQL injection, path disclosure, and file inclusion.\n\n**[Theoretical]** This is a technology-specific MAID problem.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2002-0108:** Forum product allows spoofed messages of other users via hidden form fields for name and e-mail address.\n- **CVE-2000-0253:** Shopping cart allows price modification via hidden form field.\n- **CVE-2000-0254:** Shopping cart allows price modification via hidden form field.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-441: Unintended Proxy or Intermediary ('Confused Deputy')\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product receives a request, message, or directive from an upstream component, but the product does not sufficiently preserve the original source of the request before forwarding the request to an external actor that is outside of the product's control sphere. This causes the product to appear to be the source of the request, leading it to act as a proxy or other intermediary between the upstream component and the external actor.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nIf an attacker cannot directly contact a target, but the product has access to the target, then the attacker can send a request to the product and have it be forwarded to the target. The request would appear to be coming from the product's system, not the attacker's system. As a result, the attacker can bypass access controls (such as firewalls) or hide the source of malicious requests, since the requests would not be coming directly from the attacker.\n\n\nSince proxy functionality and message-forwarding often serve a legitimate purpose, this issue only becomes a vulnerability when:\n\n\n  - The product runs with different privileges or on a different system, or otherwise has different levels of access than the upstream component;\n\n  - The attacker is prevented from making the request directly to the target; and\n\n  - The attacker can create a request that the proxy does not explicitly intend to be forwarded on the behalf of the requester. Such a request might point to an unexpected hostname, port number, hardware IP, or service. Or, the request might be sent to an allowed service, but the request could contain disallowed directives, commands, or resources.\n\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nConfused Deputy: This weakness is sometimes referred to as the \"Confused deputy\" problem, in which an attacker misused the authority of one victim (the \"confused deputy\") when targeting another victim.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-610\nCanPrecede -> CWE-668\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This weakness has a chaining relationship with CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere) because the proxy effectively provides the attacker with access to the target's resources that the attacker cannot directly obtain.\n\n**[Maintenance]** This could possibly be considered as an emergent resource.\n\n**[Theoretical]** It could be argued that the \"confused deputy\" is a fundamental aspect of most vulnerabilities that require an active attacker. Even for common implementation issues such as buffer overflows, SQL injection, OS command injection, and path traversal, the vulnerable program already has the authorization to run code or access files. The vulnerability arises when the attacker causes the program to run unexpected code or access unexpected files.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-1999-0017:** FTP bounce attack. The design of the protocol allows an attacker to modify the PORT command to cause the FTP server to connect to other machines besides the attacker's.\n- **CVE-1999-0168:** RPC portmapper could redirect service requests from an attacker to another entity, which thinks the requests came from the portmapper.\n- **CVE-2005-0315:** FTP server does not ensure that the IP address in a PORT command is the same as the FTP user's session, allowing port scanning by proxy.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-248: Uncaught Exception\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nAn exception is thrown from a function, but it is not caught.\n\n### Extended Description\nWhen an exception is not caught, it may cause the program to crash or expose sensitive information.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-705\nChildOf -> CWE-755\nChildOf -> CWE-703\nChildOf -> CWE-703\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2023-41151:** SDK for OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) server has uncaught exception when a socket is blocked for writing but the server tries to send an error\n- **CVE-2023-21087:** Java code in a smartphone OS can encounter a \"boot loop\" due to an uncaught exception\n\n",

        "score": 270.22709217828105,
        "matched_text": "CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference\n\nType: Base\n\nStatus: Draft\n\nAlternative Terms:\n\nXXE - An acronym used for the term \"XML eXternal Entities\"\n\nXXE - An acronym used for the term \"XML eXternal Entities\"\n\nXXE - An acronym used for the term \"XML eXternal Entities\"\n\nDescription:\n\nThe product processes an XML document that can contain XML entities with URIs that resolve to documents outside of the intended sphere of control, causing the product to embed incorrect documents into its output.\n\nExtended Details:\n\n\n\nXML documents optionally contain a Document Type Definition (DTD), which, among other features, enables the definition of XML entities. It is possible to define an entity by providing a substitution string in the form of a URI. The XML parser can access the contents of this URI and embed these contents back into the XML document for further processing.\n\n\nBy submitting an XML file that defines an external entity with a file:// URI, an attacker can cause the processing application to read the contents of a local file. For example, a URI such as \"file:///c:/winnt/win.ini\" designates (in Windows) the file C:\\Winnt\\win.ini, or file:///etc/passwd designates the password file in Unix-based systems. Using URIs with other schemes such as http://, the attacker can force the application to make outgoing requests to servers that the attacker cannot reach directly, which can be used to bypass firewall restrictions or hide the source of attacks such as port scanning.\n\n\nOnce the content of the URI is read, it is fed back into the application that is processing the XML. This application may echo back the data (e.g. in an error message), thereby exposing the file contents.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-42745: Recruiter software allows reading arbitrary files using XXE\n\n- CVE-2005-1306: A browser control can allow remote attackers to determine the existence of files via Javascript containing XML script.\n\n- CVE-2012-5656: XXE during SVG image conversion\n\n- CVE-2012-2239: XXE in PHP application allows reading the application's configuration file.\n\n- CVE-2012-3489: XXE in database server\n\n- CVE-2012-4399: XXE in rapid web application development framework allows reading arbitrary files.\n\n- CVE-2012-3363: XXE via XML-RPC request.\n\n- CVE-2012-0037: XXE in office document product using RDF.\n\n- CVE-2011-4107: XXE in web-based administration tool for database.\n\n- CVE-2010-3322: XXE in product that performs large-scale data analysis.\n\n- CVE-2009-1699: XXE in XSL stylesheet functionality in a common library used by some web browsers.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-25817: SilverStripe through 4.6.0-rc1 has an XXE Vulnerability in CSSContentParser. A developer utility meant for parsing HTML within unit tests can be vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks. When this developer utility is misused for purposes involving external or user submitted data in custom project code, it can lead to vulnerabilities such as XSS on HTML output rendered through this custom code. This is now mitigated by disabling external entities during parsing. (The correct CVE ID year is 2020 [CVE-2020-25817, not CVE-2021-25817]).\n\n- CVE-2021-20453: IBM WebSphere Application Server 8.0, 8.5, and 9.0 is vulnerable to a XML External Entity Injection (XXE) attack when processing XML data. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to expose sensitive information or consume memory resources. IBM X-Force ID: 196648.\n\n- CVE-2021-22158: The Proofpoint Insider Threat Management Server (formerly ObserveIT Server) is vulnerable to XML external entity (XXE) injection in the Web Console. The vulnerability requires admin user privileges and knowledge of the XML file's encryption key to successfully exploit. All versions before 7.11 are affected.\n\n- CVE-2021-28973: The XML Import functionality of the Administration console in Perforce Helix ALM 2020.3.1 Build 22 accepts XML input data that is parsed by insecurely configured software components, leading to XXE attacks.\n\n- CVE-2021-30137: Assyst 10 SP7.5 has authenticated XXE leading to SSRF via XML unmarshalling. The application allows users to send JSON or XML data to the server. It was possible to inject malicious XML data through several access points.\n\n- CVE-2021-34706: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive information or conduct a server-side request forgery (SSRF) attack through an affected device. This vulnerability is due to improper handling of XML External Entity (XXE) entries when parsing certain XML files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading a crafted XML file that contains references to external entities. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to retrieve files from the local system, resulting in the disclosure of sensitive information, or cause the web application to perform arbitrary HTTP requests on behalf of the attacker.\n\n- CVE-2021-38948: IBM InfoSphere Information Server 11.7 is vulnerable to an XML External Entity Injection (XXE) attack when processing XML data. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to expose sensitive information or consume memory resources.

Any SysAid environment that uses the Okta SSO integration might be vulnerable. An unauthenticated attacker could exploit the XXE vulnerability by sending a malformed POST request to the identity provider endpoint. An attacker can extract the identity provider endpoint by decoding the SAMLRequest parameter's value and searching for the AssertionConsumerServiceURL parameter's value. It often allows an attacker to view files on the application server filesystem and interact with any back-end or external systems that the application can access. In some situations, an attacker can escalate an XXE attack to compromise the underlying server or other back-end infrastructure by leveraging the XXE vulnerability to perform server-side request forgery (SSRF) attacks.\n\n- CVE-2022-24449: Solar appScreener through 3.10.4, when a valid license is not present, allows XXE and SSRF attacks via a crafted XML document.\n\n- CVE-2022-2458: XML external entity injection(XXE) is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with an application's processing of XML data. This attack occurs when XML input containing a reference to an external entity is processed by a weakly configured XML parser. The software processes an XML document that can contain XML entities with URIs that resolve to documents outside of the intended sphere of control, causing the product to embed incorrect documents into its output. Here, XML external entity injection lead to External Service interaction & Internal file read in Business Central and also Kie-Server APIs.\n\n- CVE-2022-27193: CVRF-CSAF-Converter before 1.0.0-rc2 resolves XML External Entities (XXE). This leads to the inclusion of arbitrary (local) file content into the generated output document. An attacker can exploit this to disclose information from the system running the converter.\n\n- CVE-2022-3338: An External XML entity (XXE) vulnerability in ePO prior to 5.10 Update 14 can lead to an unauthenticated remote attacker to potentially trigger a Server Side Request Forgery attack. This can be exploited by mimicking the Agent Handler call to ePO and passing the carefully constructed XML file through the API.\n\n- CVE-2022-35741: Apache CloudStack version 4.5.0 and later has a SAML 2.0 authentication Service Provider plugin which is found to be vulnerable to XML external entity (XXE) injection. This plugin is not enabled by default and the attacker would require that this plugin be enabled to exploit the vulnerability. When the SAML 2.0 plugin is enabled in affected versions of Apache CloudStack could potentially allow the exploitation of XXE vulnerabilities. The SAML 2.0 messages constructed during the authentication flow in Apache CloudStack are XML-based and the XML data is parsed by various standard libraries that are now understood to be vulnerable to XXE injection attacks such as arbitrary file reading, possible denial of service, server-side request forgery (SSRF) on the CloudStack management server.\n\n- CVE-2022-38342: Safe Software FME Server v2021.2.5, v2022.0.0.2 and below was discovered to contain a XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability which allows authenticated attackers to perform data exfiltration or Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks.\n\n- CVE-2022-3980: An XML External Entity (XEE) vulnerability allows server-side request forgery (SSRF) and potential code execution in Sophos Mobile managed on-premises between versions 5.0.0 and 9.7.4.\n\n- CVE-2022-42745: CandidATS version 3.0.0 allows an external attacker to read arbitrary files from the server.

For example, because UDP is a connectionless protocol, UDP packets can be spoofed by specifying a false source address in the packet; when the server receives the packet and sends a reply, it will specify a destination by using the source of the incoming packet - i.e., the false source. The server can then be tricked into sending traffic to the wrong host, which is effective for hiding the real source of an attack and for conducting a distributed denial of service (DDoS). As another example, server-side request forgery (SSRF) and XML External Entity (XXE) can be used to trick a server into making outgoing requests to hosts that cannot be directly accessed by the attacker due to firewall restrictions.\n\n  - If the product incorrectly specifies the destination, then an attacker who can control this destination might be able to spoof trusted servers. While the most common occurrence is likely due to misconfiguration by an administrator, this can be resultant from other weaknesses. For example, the product might incorrectly parse an e-mail or IP address and send sensitive data to an unintended destination. As another example, an Android application may use a \"sticky broadcast\" to communicate with a receiver for a particular application, but since sticky broadcasts can be processed by *any* receiver, this can allow a malicious application to access restricted data that was only intended for a different application.\n\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2013-5211: composite: NTP feature generates large responses (high amplification factor) with spoofed UDP source addresses.\n\n- CVE-1999-0513: Classic \"Smurf\" attack, using spoofed ICMP packets to broadcast addresses.\n\n- CVE-1999-1379: DNS query with spoofed source address causes more traffic to be returned to spoofed address than was sent by the attacker.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-0590: In sendNetworkConditionsBroadcast of NetworkMonitor.java, there is a possible way for a privileged app to receive WiFi BSSID and SSID without location permissions due to a missing permission check.

This could lead to local information disclosure with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-10 Android-11 Android-8.1 Android-9Android ID: A-174493336\n\n- CVE-2021-44225: In Keepalived through 2.2.4, the D-Bus policy does not sufficiently restrict the message destination, allowing any user to inspect and manipulate any property. This leads to access-control bypass in some situations in which an unrelated D-Bus system service has a settable (writable) property\n\n- CVE-2021-45884: In Brave Desktop 1.17 through 1.33 before 1.33.106, when CNAME-based adblocking and a proxying extension with a SOCKS fallback are enabled, additional DNS requests are issued outside of the proxying extension using the system's DNS settings, resulting in information disclosure. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2021-21323 and CVE-2021-22916.\n\n- CVE-2022-21671: @replit/crosis is a JavaScript client that speaks Replit's container protocol. A vulnerability that involves exposure of sensitive information exists in versions prior to 7.3.1. When using this library as a way to programmatically communicate with Replit in a standalone fashion, if there are multiple failed attempts to contact Replit through a WebSocket, the library will attempt to communicate using a fallback poll-based proxy. The URL of the proxy has changed, so any communication done to the previous URL could potentially reach a server that is outside of Replit's control and the token used to connect to the Repl could be obtained by an attacker, leading to full compromise of that Repl (not of the account). This was patched in version 7.3.1 by updating the address of the fallback WebSocket polling proxy to the new one. As a workaround, a user may specify the new address for the polling host (`gp-v2.replit.com`) in the `ConnectArgs`. More information about this workaround is available in the GitHub Security Advisory.\n\n- CVE-2022-21673: Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. In affected versions when a data source has the Forward OAuth Identity feature enabled, sending a query to that datasource with an API token (and no other user credentials) will forward the OAuth Identity of the most recently logged-in user. This can allow API token holders to retrieve data for which they may not have intended access. This attack relies on the Grafana instance having data sources that support the Forward OAuth Identity feature, the Grafana instance having a data source with the Forward OAuth Identity feature toggled on, the Grafana instance having OAuth enabled, and the Grafana instance having usable API keys. This issue has been patched in versions 7.5.13 and 8.3.4.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-923 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-406 (CanPrecede)",

Further it is also possible to inject PHP code, leading to a Remote Code execution (RCE) vulnerability, even if the DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT and DISALLOW_FILE_MOD constants are both set.\n\n- CVE-2022-35651: A stored XSS and blind SSRF vulnerability was found in Moodle, occurs due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied data in the SCORM track details. A remote attacker can trick the victim to follow a specially crafted link and execute arbitrary HTML and script code in user's browser in context of vulnerable website to steal potentially sensitive information, change appearance of the web page, can perform phishing and drive-by-download attacks.\n\n- CVE-2022-36325: Affected devices do not properly sanitize data introduced by an user when rendering the web interface. This could allow an authenticated remote attacker with administrative privileges to inject code and lead to a DOM-based XSS.\n\n- CVE-2022-4029: The Simple:Press plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the 'sforum_[md5 hash of the WordPress URL]' cookie value in versions up to, and including, 6.8 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link. This would be highly complex to exploit as it would require the attacker to set the cookie a cookie for the targeted user.\n\n- CVE-2022-24720: image_processing is an image processing wrapper for libvips and ImageMagick/GraphicsMagick. Prior to version 1.12.2, using the `#apply` method from image_processing to apply a series of operations that are coming from unsanitized user input allows the attacker to execute shell commands. This method is called internally by Active Storage variants, so Active Storage is vulnerable as well. The vulnerability has been fixed in version 1.12.2 of image_processing. As a workaround, users who process based on user input should always sanitize the user input by allowing only a constrained set of operations.\n\n- CVE-2021-25296: Nagios XI version xi-5.7.5 is affected by OS command injection. The vulnerability exists in the file /usr/local/nagiosxi/html/includes/configwizards/windowswmi/windowswmi.inc.php due to improper sanitization of authenticated user-controlled input by a single HTTP request, which can lead to OS command injection on the Nagios XI server.\n\n- CVE-2021-25297: Nagios XI version xi-5.7.5 is affected by OS command injection.

In versions prior to 1.3.0 there exists a DoS vulnerability that is possible due to a bug in the library that would allow an attacker with specifically designed queries to cause stack overflow panics. Any user with access to the GraphQL handler can send these queries and cause stack overflows. This in turn could potentially compromise the ability of the server to serve data to its users. The issue has been patched in version `v1.3.0`. The only known workaround for this issue is to disable the `graphql.MaxDepth` option from your schema which is not recommended.\n\n- CVE-2022-23591: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The `GraphDef` format in TensorFlow does not allow self recursive functions. The runtime assumes that this invariant is satisfied. However, a `GraphDef` containing a fragment such as the following can be consumed when loading a `SavedModel`. This would result in a stack overflow during execution as resolving each `NodeDef` means resolving the function itself and its nodes. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2022-24675: encoding/pem in Go before 1.17.9 and 1.18.x before 1.18.1 has a Decode stack overflow via a large amount of PEM data.\n\n- CVE-2022-31019: Vapor is a server-side Swift HTTP web framework.

The issue is unbounded, attacker controlled stack growth which will at some point lead to a stack overflow and a process crash. This issue has been fixed in version 4.61.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-31099: rulex is a new, portable, regular expression language. When parsing untrusted rulex expressions, the stack may overflow, possibly enabling a Denial of Service attack. This happens when parsing an expression with several hundred levels of nesting, causing the process to abort immediately. This is a security concern for you, if your service parses untrusted rulex expressions (expressions provided by an untrusted user), and your service becomes unavailable when the process running rulex aborts due to a stack overflow. The crash is fixed in version **0.4.3**. Affected users are advised to update to this version. There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-3216: A vulnerability has been found in Nintendo Game Boy Color and classified as problematic.

Versions prior to 1.4.20 may allow a remote attacker to terminate the application with a stack overflow error, resulting in a denial of service only via manipulation the processed input stream. The attack uses the hash code implementation for collections and maps to force recursive hash calculation causing a stack overflow. This issue is patched in version 1.4.20 which handles the stack overflow and raises an InputManipulationException instead. A potential workaround for users who only use HashMap or HashSet and whose XML refers these only as default map or set, is to change the default implementation of java.util.Map and java.util per the code example in the referenced advisory. However, this implies that your application does not care about the implementation of the map and all elements are comparable.\n\n- CVE-2022-47662: GPAC MP4Box 2.1-DEV-rev649-ga8f438d20 has a segment fault (/stack overflow) due to infinite recursion in Media_GetSample isomedia/media.c:662\n\n- CVE-2022-23460: Jsonxx or Json++ is a JSON parser, writer and reader written in C++.

Web applications often mistakenly make the assumption that data passed to the client in hidden fields or cookies is not susceptible to tampering. Improper validation of data that are user-controllable can lead to the application processing incorrect, and often malicious, input.\n\n\nFor example, custom cookies commonly store session data or persistent data across sessions. This kind of session data is normally involved in security related decisions on the server side, such as user authentication and access control. Thus, the cookies might contain sensitive data such as user credentials and privileges. This is a dangerous practice, as it can often lead to improper reliance on the value of the client-provided cookie by the server side application.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2002-0108: Forum product allows spoofed messages of other users via hidden form fields for name and e-mail address.\n\n- CVE-2000-0253: Shopping cart allows price modification via hidden form field.\n\n- CVE-2000-0254: Shopping cart allows price modification via hidden form field.\n\n- CVE-2000-0926: Shopping cart allows price modification via hidden form field.\n\n- CVE-2000-0101: Shopping cart allows price modification via hidden form field.\n\n- CVE-2000-0102: Shopping cart allows price modification via hidden form field.\n\n- CVE-2000-0758: Allows admin access by modifying value of form field.\n\n- CVE-2002-1880: Read messages by modifying message ID parameter.\n\n- CVE-2000-1234: Send email to arbitrary users by modifying email parameter.\n\n- CVE-2005-1652: Authentication bypass by setting a parameter.\n\n- CVE-2005-1784: Product does not check authorization for configuration change admin script, leading to password theft via modified e-mail address field.\n\n- CVE-2005-2314: Logic error leads to password disclosure.\n\n- CVE-2005-1682: Modification of message number parameter allows attackers to read other people's messages.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-35324: A vulnerability in the Form_Login function of TOTOLINK A720R A720R_Firmware V4.1.5cu.470_B20200911 allows attackers to bypass authentication.\n\n- CVE-2021-36383: Xen Orchestra (with xo-web through 5.80.0 and xo-server through 5.84.0) mishandles authorization, as demonstrated by modified WebSocket resourceSet.getAll data is which the attacker changes the permission field from none to admin.

This causes the product to appear to be the source of the request, leading it to act as a proxy or other intermediary between the upstream component and the external actor.\n\nExtended Details:\n\n\n\nIf an attacker cannot directly contact a target, but the product has access to the target, then the attacker can send a request to the product and have it be forwarded to the target. The request would appear to be coming from the product's system, not the attacker's system. As a result, the attacker can bypass access controls (such as firewalls) or hide the source of malicious requests, since the requests would not be coming directly from the attacker.\n\n\nSince proxy functionality and message-forwarding often serve a legitimate purpose, this issue only becomes a vulnerability when:\n\n\n  - The product runs with different privileges or on a different system, or otherwise has different levels of access than the upstream component;\n\n  - The attacker is prevented from making the request directly to the target; and\n\n  - The attacker can create a request that the proxy does not explicitly intend to be forwarded on the behalf of the requester. Such a request might point to an unexpected hostname, port number, hardware IP, or service. Or, the request might be sent to an allowed service, but the request could contain disallowed directives, commands, or resources.\n\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-1999-0017: FTP bounce attack.

BLS signature validation in lotus uses blst library method VerifyCompressed. This method accepts signatures in 2 forms: \"serialized\", and \"compressed\", meaning that BLS signatures can be provided as either of 2 unique byte arrays. Lotus block validation functions perform a uniqueness check on provided blocks. Two blocks are considered distinct if the CIDs of their blockheader do not match. The CID method for blockheader includes the BlockSig of the block. The result of these issues is that it would be possible to punish miners for valid blocks, as there are two different valid block CIDs available for each block, even though this must be unique. By switching from the go based `blst` bindings over to the bindings in `filecoin-ffi`, the code paths now ensure that all signatures are compressed by size and the way they are deserialized. This happened in https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/5393.\n\n- CVE-2020-23533: Union Pay up to 1.2.0, for web based versions contains a CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature vulnerability, allows attackers to shop for free in merchants' websites and mobile apps, via a crafted authentication code (MAC) which is generated based on a secret key which is NULL.\n\n- CVE-2021-0152: Improper verification of cryptographic signature in the installer for some Intel(R) Wireless Bluetooth(R) and Killer(TM) Bluetooth(R) products in Windows 10 may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable denial of service via local access.\n\n- CVE-2021-21238: PySAML2 is a pure python implementation of SAML Version 2 Standard. PySAML2 before 6.5.0 has an improper verification of cryptographic signature vulnerability. All users of pysaml2 that need to validate signed SAML documents are impacted. The vulnerability is a variant of XML Signature wrapping because it did not validate the SAML document against an XML schema. This allowed invalid XML documents to be processed and such a document can trick pysaml2 with a wrapped signature. This is fixed in PySAML2 6.5.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-21239: PySAML2 is a pure python implementation of SAML Version 2 Standard. PySAML2 before 6.5.0 has an improper verification of cryptographic signature vulnerability. Users of pysaml2 that use the default CryptoBackendXmlSec1 backend and need to verify signed SAML documents are impacted. PySAML2 does not ensure that a signed SAML document is correctly signed. The default CryptoBackendXmlSec1 backend is using the xmlsec1 binary to verify the signature of signed SAML documents, but by default xmlsec1 accepts any type of key found within the given document. xmlsec1 needs to be configured explicitly to only use only _x509 certificates_ for the verification process of the SAML document signature. This is fixed in PySAML2 6.5.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-22708: A CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature vulnerability exists in EVlink City (EVC1S22P4 / EVC1S7P4 all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1), EVlink Parking (EVW2 / EVF2 / EV.2 all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1), and EVlink Smart Wallbox (EVB1A all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1 ) that could allow an attacker to craft a malicious firmware package and bypass the signature verification mechanism.\n\n- CVE-2021-22734: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature vulnerability exists in homeLYnk (Wiser For KNX) and spaceLYnk V2.60 and prior which could cause remote code execution when an attacker loads unauthorized code.\n\n- CVE-2021-22735: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature vulnerability exists inhomeLYnk (Wiser For KNX) and spaceLYnk V2.60 and prior which could allow remote code execution when unauthorized code is copied to the device.\n\n- CVE-2021-28091: Lasso all versions prior to 2.7.0 has improper verification of a cryptographic signature.\n\n- CVE-2021-3033: An improper verification of cryptographic signature vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks Prisma Cloud Compute console.

Braun SpaceCom2 prior to 012U000062 allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to send the device malicious data that will be used in place of the correct data. This results in full system command access and execution because of the lack of cryptographic signatures on critical data sets.\n\n- CVE-2021-37160: A firmware validation issue was discovered in HMI3 Control Panel in Swisslog Healthcare Nexus Panel operated by released versions of software before Nexus Software 7.2.5.7. There is no firmware validation (e.g., cryptographic signature validation) during a File Upload for a firmware update.\n\n- CVE-2020-36284: Union Pay up to 3.4.93.4.9, for android, contains a CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature vulnerability, allows attackers to shop for free in merchants' websites and mobile apps, via a crafted authentication code (MAC) which is generated based on a secret key which is NULL.\n\n- CVE-2020-36285: Union Pay up to 3.3.12, for iOS mobile apps, contains a CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature vulnerability, allows attackers to shop for free in merchants' websites and mobile apps, via a crafted authentication code (MAC) which is generated based on a secret key which is NULL.\n\n- CVE-2021-32685: tEnvoy contains the PGP, NaCl, and PBKDF2 in node.js and the browser (hashing, random, encryption, decryption, signatures, conversions), used by TogaTech.org. In versions prior to 7.0.3, the `verifyWithMessage` method of `tEnvoyNaClSigningKey` always returns `true` for any signature that has a SHA-512 hash matching the SHA-512 hash of the message even if the signature was invalid. This issue is patched in version 7.0.3. As a workaround: In `tenvoy.js` under the `verifyWithMessage` method definition within the `tEnvoyNaClSigningKey` class, ensure that the return statement call to `this.verify` ends in `.verified`.\n\n- CVE-2021-32738: js-stellar-sdk is a Javascript library for communicating with a Stellar Horizon server. The `Utils.readChallengeTx` function used in SEP-10 Stellar Web Authentication states in its function documentation that it reads and validates the challenge transaction including verifying that the `serverAccountID` has signed the transaction. In js-stellar-sdk before version 8.2.3, the function does not verify that the server has signed the transaction. Applications that also used `Utils.verifyChallengeTxThreshold` or `Utils.verifyChallengeTxSigners` to verify the signatures including the server signature on the challenge transaction are unaffected as those functions verify the server signed the transaction. Applications calling `Utils.readChallengeTx` should update to version 8.2.3, the first version with a patch for this vulnerability, to ensure that the challenge transaction is completely valid and signed by the server creating the challenge transaction.\n\n- CVE-2021-37927: Zoho ManageEngine ADManager Plus version 7110 and prior allows account takeover via SSO.\n\n- CVE-2021-29108: There is an privilege escalation vulnerability in organization-specific logins in Esri Portal for ArcGIS versions 10.9 and below that may allow a remote, authenticated attacker who is able to intercept and modify a SAML assertion to impersonate another account (XML Signature Wrapping Attack). In addition patching, Esri also strongly recommends as best practice for SAML assertions to be signed and encrypted.\n\n- CVE-2021-20156: Trendnet AC2600 TEW-827DRU version 2.08B01 contains an improper access control configuration that could allow for a malicious firmware update. It is possible to manually install firmware that may be malicious in nature as there does not appear to be any signature validation done to determine if it is from a known and trusted source. This includes firmware updates that are done via the automated \"check for updates\" in the admin interface. If an attacker is able to masquerade as the update server, the device will not verify that the firmware updates downloaded are legitimate.\n\n- CVE-2020-1464: A spoofing vulnerability exists when Windows incorrectly validates file signatures. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could bypass security features and load improperly signed files. In an attack scenario, an attacker could bypass security features intended to prevent improperly signed files from being loaded. The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Windows validates file signatures. \n\n- CVE-2020-2021: When Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) authentication is enabled and the 'Validate Identity Provider Certificate' option is disabled (unchecked), improper verification of signatures in PAN-OS SAML authentication enables an unauthenticated network-based attacker to access protected resources. The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable server to exploit this vulnerability. This issue affects PAN-OS 9.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.1.3; PAN-OS 9.0 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.0.9; PAN-OS 8.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 8.1.15, and all versions of PAN-OS 8.0 (EOL). This issue does not affect PAN-OS 7.1. This issue cannot be exploited if SAML is not used for authentication. This issue cannot be exploited if the 'Validate Identity Provider Certificate' option is enabled (checked) in the SAML Identity Provider Server Profile. Resources that can be protected by SAML-based single sign-on (SSO) authentication are: GlobalProtect Gateway, GlobalProtect Portal, GlobalProtect Clientless VPN, Authentication and Captive Portal, PAN-OS next-generation firewalls (PA-Series, VM-Series) and Panorama web interfaces, Prisma Access In the case of GlobalProtect Gateways, GlobalProtect Portal, Clientless VPN, Captive Portal, and Prisma Access, an unauthenticated attacker with network access to the affected servers can gain access to protected resources if allowed by configured authentication and Security policies. There is no impact on the integrity and availability of the gateway, portal or VPN server. An attacker cannot inspect or tamper with sessions of regular users. In the worst case, this is a critical severity vulnerability with a CVSS Base Score of 10.0 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N). In the case of PAN-OS and Panorama web interfaces, this issue allows an unauthenticated attacker with network access to the PAN-OS or Panorama web interfaces to log in as an administrator and perform administrative actions. In the worst-case scenario, this is a critical severity vulnerability with a CVSS Base Score of 10.0 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H). If the web interfaces are only accessible to a restricted management network, then the issue is lowered to a CVSS Base Score of 9.6 (CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H). Palo Alto Networks is not aware of any malicious attempts to exploit this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2021-32977: AVEVA System Platform versions 2017 through 2020 R2 P01 does not verify, or incorrectly verifies, the cryptographic signature for data.\n\n- CVE-2021-35097: Possible authentication bypass due to improper order of signature verification and hashing in the signature verification call in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Mobile, Snapdragon Voice & Music, Snapdragon Wearables\n\n- CVE-2021-35113: Possible authentication bypass due to improper order of signature verification and hashing in the signature verification call in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Mobile, Snapdragon Wearables\n\n- CVE-2021-36277: Dell Command | Update, Dell Update, and Alienware Update versions before 4.3 contains an Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature Vulnerability. A local authenticated malicious user may exploit this vulnerability by executing arbitrary code on the system.\n\n- CVE-2021-43074: An improper verification of cryptographic signature vulnerability [CWE-347] in FortiWeb 6.4 all versions, 6.3.16 and below, 6.2 all versions, 6.1 all versions, 6.0 all versions; FortiOS 7.0.3 and below, 6.4.8 and below, 6.2 all versions, 6.0 all versions; FortiSwitch 7.0.3 and below, 6.4.10 and below, 6.2 all versions, 6.0 all versions; FortiProxy 7.0.1 and below, 2.0.7 and below, 1.2 all versions, 1.1 all versions, 1.0 all versions may allow an attacker to decrypt portions of the administrative session management cookie if able to intercept the latter.\n\n- CVE-2022-1739: The tested version of Dominion Voting Systems ImageCast X does not validate application signatures to a trusted root certificate. Use of a trusted root certificate ensures software installed on a device is traceable to, or verifiable against, a cryptographic key provided by the manufacturer to detect tampering. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to install malicious code, which could also be spread to other vulnerable ImageCast X devices via removable media.\n\n- CVE-2022-20929: A vulnerability in the upgrade signature verification of Cisco Enterprise NFV Infrastructure Software (NFVIS) could allow an unauthenticated, local attacker to provide an unauthentic upgrade file for upload. This vulnerability is due to insufficient cryptographic signature verification of upgrade files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing an administrator with an unauthentic upgrade file. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to fully compromise the Cisco NFVIS system.\n\n- CVE-2022-23507: Tendermint is a high-performance blockchain consensus engine for Byzantine fault tolerant applications. Versions prior to 0.28.0 contain a potential attack via Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature, affecting anyone using the tendermint-light-client and related packages to perform light client verification (e.g. IBC-rs, Hermes). The light client does not check that the chain IDs of the trusted and untrusted headers match, resulting in a possible attack vector where someone who finds a header from an untrusted chain that satisfies all other verification conditions (e.g. enough overlapping validator signatures) could fool a light client. The attack vector is currently theoretical, and no proof-of-concept exists yet to exploit it on live networks. This issue is patched in version 0.28.0. There are no workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-24759: `@chainsafe/libp2p-noise` contains TypeScript implementation of noise protocol, an encryption protocol used in libp2p. `@chainsafe/libp2p-noise` before 4.1.2 and 5.0.3 does not correctly validate signatures during the handshake process. This may allow a man-in-the-middle to pose as other peers and get those peers banned. Users should upgrade to version 4.1.2 or 5.0.3 to receive a patch. There are currently no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-25898: The package jsrsasign before 10.5.25 are vulnerable to Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature when JWS or JWT signature with non Base64URL encoding special characters or number escaped characters may be validated as valid by mistake. Workaround: Validate JWS or JWT signature if it has Base64URL and dot safe string before executing JWS.verify() or JWS.verifyJWT() method.\n\n- CVE-2022-2790: Emerson Electric's Proficy Machine Edition Version 9.00 and prior is vulenrable to CWE-347 Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature, and does not properly verify compiled logic (PDT files) and data blocks data (BLD/BLK files).\n\n- CVE-2022-31156: Gradle is a build tool. Dependency verification is a security feature in Gradle Build Tool that was introduced to allow validation of external dependencies either through their checksum or cryptographic signatures. In versions 6.2 through 7.4.2, there are some cases in which Gradle may skip that verification and accept a dependency that would otherwise fail the build as an untrusted external artifact. This can occur in two ways. When signature verification is disabled but the verification metadata contains entries for dependencies that only have a `gpg` element but no `checksum` element. When signature verification is enabled, the verification metadata contains entries for dependencies with a `gpg` element but there is no signature file on the remote repository. In both cases, the verification will accept the dependency, skipping signature verification and not complaining that the dependency has no checksum entry. For builds that are vulnerable, there are two risks. Gradle could download a malicious binary from a repository outside your organization due to name squatting. For those still using HTTP only and not HTTPS for downloading dependencies, the build could download a malicious library instead of the expected one. Gradle 7.5 patches this issue by making sure to run checksum verification if signature verification cannot be completed, whatever the reason. Two workarounds are available: Remove all `gpg` elements from dependency verification metadata if you disable signature validation and/or avoid adding `gpg` entries for dependencies that do not have signature files.\n\n- CVE-2022-31206: The Omron SYSMAC Nx product family PLCs (NJ series, NY series, NX series, and PMAC series) through 2022-005-18 lack cryptographic authentication. These PLCs are programmed using the SYMAC Studio engineering software (which compiles IEC 61131-3 conformant POU code to native machine code for execution by the PLC's runtime). The resulting machine code is executed by a runtime, typically controlled by a real-time operating system. The logic that is downloaded to the PLC does not seem to be cryptographically authenticated, allowing an attacker to manipulate transmitted object code to the PLC and execute arbitrary machine code on the processor of the PLC's CPU module in the context of the runtime. In the case of at least the NJ series, an RTOS and hardware combination is used that would potentially allow for memory protection and privilege separation and thus limit the impact of code execution. However, it was not confirmed whether these sufficiently segment the runtime from the rest of the RTOS.\n\n- CVE-2022-31207: The Omron SYSMAC Cx product family PLCs (CS series, CJ series, and CP series) through 2022-05-18 lack cryptographic authentication. They utilize the Omron FINS (9600/TCP) protocol for engineering purposes, including downloading projects and control logic to the PLC. This protocol has authentication flaws as reported in FSCT-2022-0057. Control logic is downloaded to PLC volatile memory using the FINS Program Area Read and Program Area Write commands or to non-volatile memory using other commands from where it can be loaded into volatile memory for execution. The logic that is loaded into and executed from the user program area exists in compiled object code form. Upon execution, these object codes are first passed to a dedicated ASIC that determines whether the object code is to be executed by the ASIC or the microprocessor. In the former case, the object code is interpreted by the ASIC whereas in the latter case the object code is passed to the microprocessor for object code interpretation by a ROM interpreter. In the abnormal case where the object code cannot be handled by either, an abnormal condition is triggered and the PLC is halted. The logic that is downloaded to the PLC does not seem to be cryptographically authenticated, thus allowing an attacker to manipulate transmitted object code to the PLC and either execute arbitrary object code commands on the ASIC or on the microprocessor interpreter.\n\n- CVE-2022-34459:  Dell Command | Update, Dell Update, and Alienware Update versions prior to 4.7 contain a improper verification of cryptographic signature in get applicable driver component. A local malicious user could potentially exploit this vulnerability leading to malicious payload execution. \n\n- CVE-2022-39366: DataHub is an open-source metadata platform. Prior to version 0.8.45, the `StatelessTokenService` of the DataHub metadata service (GMS) does not verify the signature of JWT tokens. This allows an attacker to connect to DataHub instances as any user if Metadata Service authentication is enabled. This vulnerability occurs because the `StatelessTokenService` of the Metadata service uses the `parse` method of `io.jsonwebtoken.JwtParser`, which does not perform a verification of the cryptographic token signature. This means that JWTs are accepted regardless of the used algorithm. This issue may lead to an authentication bypass. Version 0.8.45 contains a patch for the issue. There are no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-41666: A CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature vulnerability exists that allows adversaries with local user privileges to load a malicious DLL which could lead to execution of malicious code. Affected Products: EcoStruxure Operator Terminal Expert(V3.3 Hotfix 1 or prior), Pro-face BLUE(V3.3 Hotfix1 or prior).\n\n- CVE-2022-41669: A CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature vulnerability exists in the SGIUtility component that allows adversaries with local user privileges to load a malicious DLL which could result in execution of malicious code. Affected Products: EcoStruxure Operator Terminal Expert(V3.3 Hotfix 1 or prior), Pro-face BLUE(V3.3 Hotfix1 or prior).\n\n- CVE-2021-23993: An attacker may perform a DoS attack to prevent a user from sending encrypted email to a correspondent. If an attacker creates a crafted OpenPGP key with a subkey that has an invalid self signature, and the Thunderbird user imports the crafted key, then Thunderbird may try to use the invalid subkey, but the RNP library rejects it from being used, causing encryption to fail. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 78.9.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-23540: In versions `<=8.5.1` of `jsonwebtoken` library, lack of algorithm definition in the `jwt.verify()` function can lead to signature validation bypass due to defaulting to the `none` algorithm for signature verification. Users are affected if you do not specify algorithms in the `jwt.verify()` function. This issue has been fixed, please update to version 9.0.0 which removes the default support for the none algorithm in the `jwt.verify()` method. There will be no impact, if you update to version 9.0.0 and you don\u2019t need to allow for the `none` algorithm. If you need 'none' algorithm, you have to explicitly specify that in `jwt.verify()` options. \n\n- CVE-2022-42793: An issue in code signature validation was addressed with improved checks. This issue is fixed in macOS Big Sur 11.7, macOS Ventura 13, iOS 16, iOS 15.7 and iPadOS 15.7, macOS Monterey 12.6. An app may be able to bypass code signing checks.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-345 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-345 (ChildOf)",

These functions are normally exposed over the network and once exploited the attacker may be able to view and modify financial accounting data that only a specific user should have access to.\n\n- CVE-2021-38431: An authenticated user using Advantech WebAccess SCADA in versions 9.0.3 and prior can use API functions to disclose project names and paths from other users.\n\n- CVE-2021-38755: Unauthenticated doctor entry deletion in Hospital Management System in admin-panel1.php.\n\n- CVE-2021-39347: The Stripe for WooCommerce WordPress plugin is missing a capability check on the save() function found in the ~/includes/admin/class-wc-stripe-admin-user-edit.php file that makes it possible for attackers to configure their account to use other site users unique STRIPE identifier and make purchases with their payment accounts. This affects versions 3.0.0 - 3.3.9.\n\n- CVE-2021-40088: An issue was discovered in PrimeKey EJBCA before 7.6.0. CMP RA Mode can be configured to use a known client certificate to authenticate enrolling clients. The same RA client certificate is used for revocation requests as well. While enrollment enforces multi tenancy constraints (by verifying that the client certificate has access to the CA and Profiles being enrolled against), this check was not performed when authenticating revocation operations, allowing a known tenant to revoke a certificate belonging to another tenant.\n\n- CVE-2021-40501: SAP ABAP Platform Kernel - versions 7.77, 7.81, 7.85, 7.86, does not perform necessary authorization checks for an authenticated business user, resulting in escalation of privileges. That means this business user is able to read and modify data beyond the vulnerable system. However, the attacker can neither significantly reduce the performance of the system nor stop the system.\n\n- CVE-2021-40502: SAP Commerce - versions 2105.3, 2011.13, 2005.18, 1905.34, does not perform necessary authorization checks for an authenticated user, resulting in escalation of privileges. Authenticated attackers will be able to access and edit data from b2b units they do not belong to.\n\n- CVE-2021-41238: Hangfire is an open source system to perform background job processing in a .NET or .NET Core applications. No Windows Service or separate process required. Dashboard UI in Hangfire.Core uses authorization filters to protect it from showing sensitive data to unauthorized users. By default when no custom authorization filters specified, `LocalRequestsOnlyAuthorizationFilter` filter is being used to allow only local requests and prohibit all the remote requests to provide sensible, protected by default settings. However due to the recent changes, in version 1.7.25 no authorization filters are used by default, allowing remote requests to succeed. If you are using `UseHangfireDashboard` method with default `DashboardOptions.Authorization` property value, then your installation is impacted. If any other authorization filter is specified in the `DashboardOptions.Authorization` property, the you are not impacted. Patched versions (1.7.26) are available both on Nuget.org and as a tagged release on the github repo. Default authorization rules now prohibit remote requests by default again by including the `LocalRequestsOnlyAuthorizationFilter` filter to the default settings. Please upgrade to the newest version in order to mitigate the issue. For users who are unable to upgrade it is possible to mitigate the issue by using the `LocalRequestsOnlyAuthorizationFilter` explicitly when configuring the Dashboard UI.\n\n- CVE-2021-42062: SAP ERP HCM Portugal does not perform necessary authorization checks for a report that reads the payroll data of employees in a certain area. Since the affected report only reads the payroll information, the attacker can neither modify any information nor cause availability impacts.\n\n- CVE-2021-42359: WP DSGVO Tools (GDPR) <= 3.1.23 had an AJAX action, \u2018admin-dismiss-unsubscribe\u2018, which lacked a capability check and a nonce check and was available to unauthenticated users, and did not check the post type when deleting unsubscription requests. As such, it was possible for an attacker to permanently delete an arbitrary post or page on the site by sending an AJAX request with the \u201caction\u201d parameter set to \u201cadmin-dismiss-unsubscribe\u201d and the \u201cid\u201d parameter set to the post to be deleted. Sending such a request would move the post to the trash, and repeating the request would permanently delete the post in question.\n\n- CVE-2021-1143: A vulnerability in Cisco Connected Mobile Experiences (CMX) API authorizations could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to enumerate what users exist on the system. The vulnerability is due to a lack of authorization checks for certain API GET requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specific API GET requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to enumerate users of the CMX system.\n\n- CVE-2021-20283: The web service responsible for fetching other users' enrolled courses did not validate that the requesting user had permission to view that information in each course in moodle before 3.10.2, 3.9.5, 3.8.8, 3.5.17.\n\n- CVE-2021-21481: The MigrationService, which is part of SAP NetWeaver versions 7.10, 7.11, 7.20, 7.30, 7.31, 7.40, 7.50, does not perform an authorization check. This might allow an unauthorized attacker to access configuration objects, including such that grant administrative privileges. This could result in complete compromise of system confidentiality, integrity, and availability.\n\n- CVE-2021-27509: In Visualware MyConnection Server before 11.0b build 5382, each published report is not associated with its own access code.\n\n- CVE-2021-34647: The Ninja Forms WordPress plugin is vulnerable to sensitive information disclosure via the bulk_export_submissions function found in the ~/includes/Routes/Submissions.php file, in versions up to and including 3.5.7. This allows authenticated attackers to export all Ninja Forms submissions data via the /ninja-forms-submissions/export REST API which can include personally identifiable information.\n\n- CVE-2021-34648: The Ninja Forms WordPress plugin is vulnerable to arbitrary email sending via the trigger_email_action function found in the ~/includes/Routes/Submissions.php file, in versions up to and including 3.5.7. This allows authenticated attackers to send arbitrary emails from the affected server via the /ninja-forms-submissions/email-action REST API which can be used to socially engineer victims.\n\n- CVE-2021-36909: Authenticated Database Reset vulnerability in WordPress WP Reset PRO Premium plugin (versions <= 5.98) allows any authenticated user to wipe the entire database regardless of their authorization. It leads to a complete website reset and takeover.\n\n- CVE-2021-38698: HashiCorp Consul and Consul Enterprise 1.10.1 Txn.Apply endpoint allowed services to register proxies for other services, enabling access to service traffic. Fixed in 1.8.15, 1.9.9 and 1.10.2.\n\n- CVE-2021-39232: In Apache Ozone versions prior to 1.2.0, certain admin related SCM commands can be executed by any authenticated users, not just by admins.\n\n- CVE-2021-40884: Projectsend version r1295 is affected by sensitive information disclosure. Because of not checking authorization in ids parameter in files-edit.php and id parameter in process.php function, a user with uploader role can download and edit all files of users in application.\n\n- CVE-2021-41554: ARCHIBUS Web Central 21.3.3.815 (a version from 2014) does not properly validate requests for access to data and functionality in these affected endpoints: /archibus/schema/ab-edit-users.axvw, /archibus/schema/ab-data-dictionary-table.axvw, /archibus/schema/ab-schema-add-field.axvw, /archibus/schema/ab-core/views/process-navigator/ab-my-user-profile.axvw. By not verifying the permissions for access to resources, it allows a potential attacker to view pages that are not allowed. Specifically, it was found that any authenticated user can reach the administrative console for user management by directly requesting access to the page via URL. This allows a malicious user to modify all users' profiles, to elevate any privileges to administrative ones, or to create or delete any type of user. It is also possible to modify the emails of other users, through a misconfiguration of the username parameter, on the user profile page. This is fixed in all recent versions, such as version 26. NOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer. Version 21.3 was officially de-supported by the end of 2020\n\n- CVE-2021-1506: Multiple vulnerabilities in Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or gain access to sensitive information, or allow an authenticated, local attacker to gain escalated privileges or gain unauthorized access to the application.

Refer to the referenced GitHub Security Advisory for complete details. This is fixed in version 0.7.5.\n\n- CVE-2021-32748: Nextcloud Richdocuments in an open source self hosted online office. Nextcloud uses the WOPI (\"Web Application Open Platform Interface\") protocol to communicate with the Collabora Editor, the communication between these two services was not protected by a credentials or IP check. Whilst this does not result in gaining access to data that the user has not yet access to, it can result in a bypass of any enforced watermark on documents as described on the [Nextcloud Virtual Data Room](https://nextcloud.com/virtual-data-room/) website and [our documentation](https://portal.nextcloud.com/article/nextcloud-and-virtual-data-room-configuration-59.html). The Nextcloud Richdocuments releases 3.8.3 and 4.2.0 add an additional admin settings for an allowlist of IP addresses that can access the WOPI API. We recommend upgrading and configuring the allowlist to a list of Collabora servers. There is no known workaround. Note that this primarily results a bypass of any configured watermark or download protection using File Access Control. If you do not require or rely on these as a security feature no immediate action is required on your end.\n\n- CVE-2021-3653: A flaw was found in the KVM's AMD code for supporting SVM nested virtualization. The flaw occurs when processing the VMCB (virtual machine control block) provided by the L1 guest to spawn/handle a nested guest (L2). Due to improper validation of the \"int_ctl\" field, this issue could allow a malicious L1 to enable AVIC support (Advanced Virtual Interrupt Controller) for the L2 guest. As a result, the L2 guest would be allowed to read/write physical pages of the host, resulting in a crash of the entire system, leak of sensitive data or potential guest-to-host escape. This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to 5.14-rc7.\n\n- CVE-2021-25409: Improper access in Notification setting prior to SMR JUN-2021 Release 1 allows physically proximate attackers to set arbitrary notification via physically configuring device.\n\n- CVE-2021-24851: The Insert Pages WordPress plugin before 3.7.0 allows users with a role as low as Contributor to access content and metadata from arbitrary posts/pages regardless of their author and status (ie private), using a shortcode. Password protected posts/pages are not affected by such issue.\n\n- CVE-2021-21984: VMware vRealize Business for Cloud 7.x prior to 7.6.0 contains a remote code execution vulnerability due to an unauthorised end point. A malicious actor with network access may exploit this issue causing unauthorised remote code execution on vRealize Business for Cloud Virtual Appliance.\n\n- CVE-2021-27903: An issue was discovered in Craft CMS before 3.6.7. In some circumstances, a potential Remote Code Execution vulnerability existed on sites that did not restrict administrative changes (if an attacker were somehow able to hijack an administrator's session).\n\n- CVE-2021-35413: A remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in course_intro_pdf_import.php of Chamilo LMS v1.11.x allows authenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted .htaccess file.\n\n- CVE-2021-21382: Restund is an open source NAT traversal server. The restund TURN server can be instructed to open a relay to the loopback address range. This allows you to reach any other service running on localhost which you might consider private. In the configuration that we ship (https://github.com/wireapp/ansible-restund/blob/master/templates/restund.conf.j2#L40-L43) the `status` interface of restund is enabled and is listening on `127.0.0.1`.The `status` interface allows users to issue administrative commands to `restund` like listing open relays or draining connections. It would be possible for an attacker to contact the status interface and issue administrative commands by setting `XOR-PEER-ADDRESS` to `127.0.0.1:{{restund_udp_status_port}}` when opening a TURN channel. We now explicitly disallow relaying to loopback addresses, 'any' addresses, link local addresses, and the broadcast address. As a workaround disable the `status` module in your restund configuration. However there might still be other services running on `127.0.0.0/8` that you do not want to have exposed. The `turn` module can be disabled. Restund will still perform STUN and this might already be enough for initiating calls in your environments. TURN is only used as a last resort when other NAT traversal options do not work. One should also make sure that the TURN server is set up with firewall rules so that it cannot relay to other addresses that you don't want the TURN server to relay to. For example other services in the same VPC where the TURN server is running. Ideally TURN servers should be deployed in an isolated fashion where they can only reach what they need to reach to perform their task of assisting NAT-traversal.\n\n- CVE-2021-36917: WordPress Hide My WP plugin (versions <= 6.2.3) can be deactivated by any unauthenticated user. It is possible to retrieve a reset token which can then be used to deactivate the plugin.\n\n- CVE-2021-39184: Electron is a framework for writing cross-platform desktop applications using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. A vulnerability in versions prior to 11.5.0, 12.1.0, and 13.3.0 allows a sandboxed renderer to request a \"thumbnail\" image of an arbitrary file on the user's system. The thumbnail can potentially include significant parts of the original file, including textual data in many cases. Versions 15.0.0-alpha.10, 14.0.0, 13.3.0, 12.1.0, and 11.5.0 all contain a fix for the vulnerability. Two workarounds aside from upgrading are available. One may make the vulnerability significantly more difficult for an attacker to exploit by enabling `contextIsolation` in one's app. One may also disable the functionality of the `createThumbnailFromPath` API if one does not need it.\n\n- CVE-2021-39231: In Apache Ozone versions prior to 1.2.0, Various internal server-to-server RPC endpoints are available for connections, making it possible for an attacker to download raw data from Datanode and Ozone manager and modify Ratis replication configuration.\n\n- CVE-2021-29958: When a download was initiated, the client did not check whether it was in normal or private browsing mode, which led to private mode cookies being shared in normal browsing mode.

All unpatched versions of Argo CD starting with 1.0.0 are vulnerable to an improper access control bug, allowing a malicious user to potentially escalate their privileges to admin-level. Versions starting with 0.8.0 and 0.5.0 contain limited versions of this issue. To perform exploits, an authorized Argo CD user must have push access to an Application's source git or Helm repository or `sync` and `override` access to an Application. Once a user has that access, different exploitation levels are possible depending on their other RBAC privileges. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in Argo CD versions 2.3.2, 2.2.8, and 2.1.14. Some mitigation measures are available but do not serve as a substitute for upgrading. To avoid privilege escalation, limit who has push access to Application source repositories or `sync` + `override` access to Applications; and limit which repositories are available in projects where users have `update` access to Applications. To avoid unauthorized resource inspection/tampering, limit who has `delete`, `get`, or `action` access to Applications.\n\n- CVE-2022-28866: Multiple Improper Access Control was discovered in Nokia AirFrame BMC Web GUI < R18 Firmware v4.13.00.

        "matched_text": "CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password\n\nType: Variant\n\nStatus: Draft\n\nDescription:\n\nThe product contains a hard-coded password, which it uses for its own inbound authentication or for outbound communication to external components.\n\nExtended Details:\n\n\n\nA hard-coded password typically leads to a significant authentication failure that can be difficult for the system administrator to detect. Once detected, it can be difficult to fix, so the administrator may be forced into disabling the product entirely. There are two main variations:\n\n```\n\t\tInbound: the product contains an authentication mechanism that checks for a hard-coded password.\n\t\tOutbound: the product connects to another system or component, and it contains hard-coded password for connecting to that component.\n```\nIn the Inbound variant, a default administration account is created, and a simple password is hard-coded into the product and associated with that account. This hard-coded password is the same for each installation of the product, and it usually cannot be changed or disabled by system administrators without manually modifying the program, or otherwise patching the product. If the password is ever discovered or published (a common occurrence on the Internet), then anybody with knowledge of this password can access the product. Finally, since all installations of the product will have the same password, even across different organizations, this enables massive attacks such as worms to take place.\n\nThe Outbound variant applies to front-end systems that authenticate with a back-end service. The back-end service may require a fixed password which can be easily discovered. The programmer may simply hard-code those back-end credentials into the front-end product. Any user of that program may be able to extract the password. Client-side systems with hard-coded passwords pose even more of a threat, since the extraction of a password from a binary is usually very simple.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-29964: Distributed Control System (DCS) has hard-coded passwords for local shell access\n\n- CVE-2021-37555: Telnet service for IoT feeder for dogs and cats has hard-coded password [REF-1288]\n\n- CVE-2021-35033: Firmware for a WiFi router uses a hard-coded password for a BusyBox shell, allowing bypass of authentication through the UART port\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-27438: The software contains a hard-coded password it uses for its own inbound authentication or for outbound communication to external components on the Reason DR60 (all firmware versions prior to 02A04.1).\n\n- CVE-2021-34757: Multiple vulnerabilities in Cisco Business 220 Series Smart Switches firmware could allow an attacker with Administrator privileges to access sensitive login credentials or reconfigure the passwords on the user account.

For example, a URI such as \"file:///c:/winnt/win.ini\" designates (in Windows) the file C:\\Winnt\\win.ini, or file:///etc/passwd designates the password file in Unix-based systems. Using URIs with other schemes such as http://, the attacker can force the application to make outgoing requests to servers that the attacker cannot reach directly, which can be used to bypass firewall restrictions or hide the source of attacks such as port scanning.\n\n\nOnce the content of the URI is read, it is fed back into the application that is processing the XML. This application may echo back the data (e.g. in an error message), thereby exposing the file contents.\n",

For example, because UDP is a connectionless protocol, UDP packets can be spoofed by specifying a false source address in the packet; when the server receives the packet and sends a reply, it will specify a destination by using the source of the incoming packet - i.e., the false source. The server can then be tricked into sending traffic to the wrong host, which is effective for hiding the real source of an attack and for conducting a distributed denial of service (DDoS). As another example, server-side request forgery (SSRF) and XML External Entity (XXE) can be used to trick a server into making outgoing requests to hosts that cannot be directly accessed by the attacker due to firewall restrictions.\n\n  - If the product incorrectly specifies the destination, then an attacker who can control this destination might be able to spoof trusted servers. While the most common occurrence is likely due to misconfiguration by an administrator, this can be resultant from other weaknesses. For example, the product might incorrectly parse an e-mail or IP address and send sensitive data to an unintended destination. As another example, an Android application may use a \"sticky broadcast\" to communicate with a receiver for a particular application, but since sticky broadcasts can be processed by *any* receiver, this can allow a malicious application to access restricted data that was only intended for a different application.\n\n",
