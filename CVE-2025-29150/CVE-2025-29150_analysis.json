While not CVE-2025-29150, it is relevant as it details a vulnerability related to text interpretation.\n\nHere's the extracted information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability stems from the potential for bidirectional Unicode text to be interpreted or compiled differently than it appears in a user interface. Hidden, bidirectional Unicode characters can swap segments of text, leading to discrepancies between the displayed code and the actual code being executed.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\nInvisible source code vulnerabilities due to the misinterpretation of bidirectional Unicode characters.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\nCode can appear one way and be interpreted or compiled another way, potentially leading to malicious code execution.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\nUsing hidden, bidirectional Unicode characters within source code files.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\nOpen files in an editor that reveals hidden Unicode characters (like Visual Studio Code) and verify the characters are necessary and not disguising malicious text. Ignoring the warning if the use of bidirectional Unicode characters is intentional and not malformed.\n\n**Note:** This content provides details about a different CVE (CVE-2021-42574) than the one specified (CVE-2025-29150).",

The vulnerability involves external control of the file name, which leads to arbitrary file deletion. |\n| CWE-22 | Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') | 0.5 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. Path traversal could be a contributing factor if the file deletion logic doesn't properly restrict the path. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship is that CWE-73 (External Control of File Name or Path) can lead to CWE-22 (Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')) if the external control is not correctly validated and allows traversal outside the intended directory.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe73[\"CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\"]\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\"]\n\n    cwe73 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe22\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe73 primary\n    class cwe22 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with external control of the filename (CWE-73), which, if not properly validated, can lead to path traversal (CWE-22) and ultimately arbitrary file deletion.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is CWE-73 (External Control of File Name or Path) because the vulnerability description states \"Arbitrary File Deletion via the id parameter\". This indicates that the 'id' parameter directly controls the file being deleted, which is an instance of external control of the file name. CWE-22 (Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')) is a secondary consideration because while arbitrary deletion is possible, traversal is not explicitly stated, however, it is likely an underlying component to the **arbitrary file deletion**.
