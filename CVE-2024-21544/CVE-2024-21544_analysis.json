  "description": "Versions of the package spatie/browsershot before 5.0.1 are vulnerable to Improper Input Validation due to **improper URL validation** through the setUrl method. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by using leading whitespace (%20) before the file// protocol, resulting in **Local File Inclusion**, which allows the attacker to read sensitive files on the server.",

  },
  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n- The vulnerability stems from improper input validation within the `setUrl` method of the `spatie/browsershot` package. Specifically, the method fails to properly sanitize or validate URLs, allowing leading whitespace characters (specifically `%20`) before the `file://` protocol.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Improper Input Validation:** The `setUrl` method doesn't adequately check for and remove leading whitespace before processing the URL.\n- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** By exploiting the lack of proper validation, an attacker can inject a URL with leading whitespace followed by `file://` and a file path. This allows them to read sensitive files on the server.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Confidentiality Breach:** Successful exploitation enables an attacker to read arbitrary files on the server, potentially exposing sensitive information such as configuration files, private keys, and other confidential data.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.\n- **URL Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the URL passed to the `setUrl` method by inserting leading whitespace before the `file://` protocol.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **No special privileges required:** The attacker does not need any specific privileges on the system to exploit this vulnerability.\n- **Network Access:**  The attacker needs to be able to send a request containing the malicious URL to the affected server.\n- **No user interaction is required:** The attack can be performed without any user interaction.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n- The vulnerability is present in versions prior to `5.0.1` of the `spatie/browsershot` package.\n- A proof-of-concept (PoC) is provided, demonstrating how to trigger the vulnerability.\n- The fix involves trimming the URL before checking for the `file://` protocol, effectively preventing the LFI.\n- The vulnerability has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2024-21544.\n- The CVSS score indicates a high severity vulnerability.",

This leads to **Local File Inclusion**, which falls under **Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')** (CWE-22). **External Control of File Name or Path** (CWE-73) can also be present because the file path is derived from external input.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\"]\n    cwe73[\"CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\"]\n\n    cwe22 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe20\n    cwe73 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe22\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe20 primary\n    class cwe22,cwe73 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with **improper input validation** (CWE-20) of the URL. This allows an attacker to inject a URL with leading whitespace followed by `file://` and a file path. This leads to **Path Traversal** (CWE-22) as the application **does not properly** limit the pathname to a restricted directory, enabling **Local File Inclusion**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary root cause is **improper input validation** (CWE-20) in the `setUrl` method, as the method **fails to properly** sanitize or validate URLs, allowing leading whitespace characters. The key phrase \"improper URL validation\" supports this selection. This **improper validation** leads directly to the ability to read sensitive files, which is a classic **Local File Inclusion** vulnerability. This can be represented by **Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')** (CWE-22). Also, **External Control of File Name or Path** (CWE-73) is considered because the file path is influenced by external input.\n\n**CWE-20** is chosen as the primary CWE because the vulnerability stems from the **lack of proper input validation**. The **improper validation** of the URL allows the injection of the `file://` protocol, which is the core of the vulnerability.\n\n**CWE-22** is chosen as a secondary CWE to describe the **Local File Inclusion** which allows the attacker to read sensitive files on the server.\n\n**CWE-73** is chosen as a secondary CWE because the file path is influenced by external input.\n\n**CWEs Considered but Not Used:**\n\n*   CWE-98: Improper Control of Filename for Include/Require Statement in PHP Program ('PHP Remote File Inclusion'): While this CWE is related to file inclusion, it's more specific to PHP programs. The vulnerability isn't exclusive to PHP, so it is not the best fit.\n*   CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting'): This CWE is related to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, which is not the case in this vulnerability.\n*   CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow'): This CWE relates to buffer overflows, which is not the type of vulnerability described.\n*   CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature: This CWE relates to cryptographic signature issues, which is not the case in this vulnerability.\n*   CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection'): This CWE relates to code injection, which is not the case in this vulnerability.",
