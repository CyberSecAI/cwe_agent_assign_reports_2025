The vulnerability description specifically mentions a race condition due to improper synchronization. |\n| CWE-662 | Improper Synchronization | 0.7 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary candidate. This CWE is a broader category that encompasses the synchronization issue, but CWE-362 is more specific to race conditions. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship considered was the hierarchical structure. CWE-362 is a Class-level CWE that describes a race condition due to improper synchronization. CWE-662 is a broader Class-level CWE about improper synchronization in general. CWE-362 is related to CWE-662, but it is a more specific case of improper synchronization.\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    cwe662[\"CWE-662: Improper Synchronization\"]\n    \n    cwe362 -->|CHILDOF| cwe662\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe362 primary\n    class cwe662 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain involves a **race condition** (CWE-362) due to **improper synchronization** (CWE-662), leading to **privilege escalation**. The root cause is the race condition where concurrent execution is not properly synchronized.\n  - Root Cause: CWE-362 (Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition'))\n  - Contributing Factor: CWE-662 (Improper Synchronization)\n  - Impact: Privilege escalation (as stated in the description)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states a **race condition** due to **improper synchronization** in Windows Secure Channel, leading to local privilege escalation. The phrase \"race condition, improper synchronization\" led to the selection of CWE-362 as the primary CWE. CWE-362 is the most specific CWE that captures both aspects of the vulnerability.\n\nCWE-662 was also considered, as it represents the **improper synchronization** aspect. However, CWE-362 is a more specific child of CWE-662 and includes the **race condition**, making it a better fit.\n\nThe provided evidence is sufficient to map the vulnerability to CWE-362 with high confidence. The relationship between CWE-362 and CWE-662 helped to confirm that CWE-362 is the more appropriate choice due to its specificity.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-662: Improper Synchronization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product utilizes multiple threads or processes to allow temporary access to a shared resource that can only be exclusive to one process at a time, but it does not properly synchronize these actions, which might cause simultaneous accesses of this resource by multiple threads or processes.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
