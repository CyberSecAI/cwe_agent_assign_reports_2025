The vulnerability allows an attacker to use the auth tokens issued by the invite user functionality to obtain valid JWT tokens. These tokens can be used to compromise target users upon registration for their own arbitrary organizations. The attacker can invite a target email, obtain a one-time use token, retract the invite, and later use the token to reset the password of the target user, leading to full account takeover. Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-90 CWE-201 CWE-1390 CWE-639 CWE-287 CWE-1391 CWE-267 CWE-359 CWE-1427",
