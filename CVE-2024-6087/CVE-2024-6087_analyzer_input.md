# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-6087

## Vulnerability Description
An **improper access control** vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary at the latest commit (a761d83) on the main branch. The vulnerability allows an attacker to use the auth tokens issued by the invite user functionality to obtain valid JWT tokens. These tokens can be used to compromise target users upon registration for their own arbitrary organizations. The attacker can invite a target email, obtain a one-time use token, retract the invite, and later use the token to reset the password of the target user, leading to full account takeover.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **improper access control**
- **impact:** account takeover
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** lunary-ai/lunary
- **version:** latest commit (a761d83) on the main branch

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability fixed by commit `844e8855c7a713dc7371766dba4125de4007b1cf`:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the password reset functionality. The original code had logic that allowed a user to request a password reset even if a valid, unexpired reset token already existed for the user. This could lead to unintended behavior and potentially security issues.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Logic Flaw in Password Reset Request Handling:** The code incorrectly handled the case where a user already had an active password reset token. Instead of preventing a new request when a valid token existed, it would trigger another reset request.
- **Incorrect JWT Type:** The original code was not setting the correct type in the token.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unnecessary Password Reset Emails:** An attacker, by knowing a target user's email, could potentially trigger multiple password reset emails. This could lead to confusion or annoyance for the target user, and potentially be a vector for other attacks.
- **Confusion and potential DoS:** Although unlikely in this case, an attacker could potentially exploit this logic by requesting multiple password resets, and potentially cause denial of service (DoS).

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Email Address:** An attacker would need to know the email address of the target user.
- **Requesting Multiple Resets:** The attacker could repeatedly request password resets for a target email.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to make requests to the `/request-password-reset` endpoint. This typically means the attacker should be able to interact with the application through its web interface or API.
- Knowledge of a valid email address is required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
The fix implemented in the commit `844e8855c7a713dc7371766dba4125de4007b1cf` addresses the vulnerability by:
- **Correcting the Logic:** The logic for handling password reset requests was updated to prevent a new request when a valid, unexpired token already exists.
- **Setting JWT type:** Added `type: "password_reset"` to password reset token.

The code changes include:
-   Removal of an if statement that incorrectly allowed reset password request if a recovery token existed and is not expired
-   Setting the JWT type to `password_reset` when generating a password reset token.

This commit ensures that a new password reset request is only generated when an existing token is expired or does not exist, preventing unnecessary reset emails and other potential issues.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control

**Authentication**:
Determines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.

* Example phrases: "user must log in", "lack of login check", "bypasses login"
* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.

  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* – used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).

**Authorization**:
Determines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do. It decides access *after* identity is verified.

* Example phrases: "unauthorized access", "regular user can access admin panel", "role checks are missing"
* CWE relevance: use CWEs like 862, 863, 285 for authorization errors:

  * **CWE-862**: *Missing Authorization* – the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all.
  * **CWE-863**: *Incorrect Authorization* – the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).
  * **CWE-285**: *Improper Authorization* – general category for any flawed authorization logic or design.

**Access Control**:
A broader term that includes both authentication and authorization. Governs how resources are protected and who can access them under what conditions.

* CWE relevance:

  * **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* – top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear.
  * This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.

## Mapping Discussion – Common Misclassification Patterns

### 1. **CWE-306 vs CWE-862**:

* **306** is about lack of **authentication** (e.g., *no login required at all*).
* **862** is about lack of **authorization** *after* authentication (e.g., *admin check missing*).
* ✅ Example CWE-306: *“An unauthenticated attacker can invoke the password reset API.”*
* ✅ Example CWE-862: *“An authenticated user without admin privileges can delete any user account.”*

### 2. **CWE-285 vs CWE-284**:

* **285** is specific to authorization flaws – it's a better choice than 284 **if** the issue involves *improper or missing role checks*.
* **284** should be reserved for general access control issues when it’s unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.

---

## Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification

**Phrase like "unauthorized access" is not enough.**

* If you **cannot determine whether identity was checked**, assume it’s **authorization** and consider 862 or 863.
* If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** → CWE-306.
* If the **access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced**, but it's not due to missing checks, consider **CWE-284**.

---

## Good Mapping Examples

* ✅ **CWE-306**: “The endpoint `/admin/deleteUser` does not require any authentication.”
* ✅ **CWE-862**: “Any logged-in user can change any other user's email without being an admin.”
* ✅ **CWE-863**: “An admin check exists but incorrectly grants access to non-admin users.”
* ✅ **CWE-285**: “Application uses a static role check that fails when roles change dynamically.”
* ✅ **CWE-284**: “Inconsistent enforcement of access rules across services with unclear policy source.”
