  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability is classified as \"Content Injection\" which typically arises from a lack of proper sanitization or escaping of user-supplied data that is later displayed on the website. The specific mechanism of injection is not detailed.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\nThe primary weakness is the plugin's failure to properly handle input, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary content into the website.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\nAn attacker could inject malicious content, potentially including:\n*   Phishing pages designed to steal user credentials.\n*   Arbitrary HTML or JavaScript, leading to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.\n*   Malicious iframes or redirects.\n*   Defacement of the website's content.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\nThe attack vector involves injecting malicious content into the ARForms Form Builder plugin. The specifics of how the injection occurs (e.g., through a form field or a specific plugin feature) are not provided but it is likely through a form submission.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\nThe attacker does not need to be authenticated meaning the vulnerability can be exploited by any unauthenticated user.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n*   The vulnerability has a low severity and is unlikely to be exploited, according to the source.\n*   The vulnerability is present in versions <= 1.7.1 of the ARForms Form Builder plugin.\n*   The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.7.2 of the plugin.\n*   The vulnerability is classified under OWASP Top 10 as A3: Injection.",
