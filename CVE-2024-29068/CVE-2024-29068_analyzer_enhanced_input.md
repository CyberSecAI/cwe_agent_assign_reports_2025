## Vulnerability Description
In snapd versions prior to 2.62, snapd failed to properly check the file type when extracting a snap. The snap format is a squashfs file-system image and so can contain files that are non-regular files (such as pipes or sockets etc). Various file entries within the snap squashfs image (such as icons etc) are directly read by snapd when it is extracted. An attacker who could convince a user to install a malicious snap which contained non-regular files at these paths could then cause snapd to block indefinitely trying to read from such files and cause a denial of service.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **improper file type check**
- **impact:** denial of service
- **product:** snapd
- **version:** prior to 2.62

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of symbolic links (symlinks) within snap packages. Specifically, the code did not properly prevent symlinks from pointing outside the container, or to potentially problematic locations like the root directory (`.`) or the `meta` directory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **External Symlink Vulnerability:** The code did not adequately check if a symlink target was external to the snap container. An attacker could potentially create a symlink that points to a location outside the snap's intended scope.
*   **Bad Symlink Targets:** The code did not prevent symlinks pointing to `.` or `meta` directory.
*   **Inadequate Symlink Evaluation:** The initial implementation had a potential for infinite loops due to insufficient limits when evaluating nested symlinks, which was mitigated by introducing `maxDepth`.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Access (Potentially):** By creating malicious symlinks that point to sensitive locations outside the snap container, an attacker could potentially gain read or write access to arbitrary files on the system.
*   **Denial of Service (Potentially):**  If symlink loops were not handled correctly, they could have led to a denial of service. The introduction of `maxDepth` prevents infinite loop.
*   **Circumvention of Security Measures:**  Exploitation could bypass intended security restrictions by manipulating the file system access within the snap's environment.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Malicious Snap Package Creation:** An attacker could create a specially crafted snap package that includes malicious symlinks.
*   **Compromised Snap Store (Potentially):** If the attacker were able to compromise a snap store, they could distribute malicious snap packages.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Ability to Create and Distribute Snap Packages:**  The attacker would need the ability to create their own snap packages and potentially distribute them through a channel where they will be installed.
*   **Understanding of Snap Package Structure:** The attacker would need knowledge about how snap packages are structured and how symlinks are handled.

**Additional Details:**

* The provided content shows a fix for this issue. The fix includes a new function `evalAndValidateSymlink` which evaluates symlinks and ensures that the target of a symlink is not external to the container. It also checks for symlinks that target "." or "meta" directories.
* The commit message "many: container validation improvements" indicates this is a broader change to improve validation and not just addressing one specific issue.
* Code review comments show concerns about the efficiency of string manipulation, which was addressed by using `strings.HasPrefix` instead of splitting and indexing the string.

In summary, the vulnerability allowed for malicious symlinks within snap packages to potentially escape the container, leading to arbitrary file access, denial of service, and circumvention of security measures. The provided code changes contain a fix which introduces proper symlink validation and prevents external symlinks, as well as symlinks pointing to '.' and 'meta' directories.
