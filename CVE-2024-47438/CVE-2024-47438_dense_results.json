  "query": "Substance3D - Painter versions 10.1.0 and earlier are affected by a Write-what-where Condition vulnerability that could lead to a memory leak. This vulnerability allows an attacker to write a controlled value at a controlled memory location, which could result in the disclosure of sensitive memory content. Exploitation of this issue requires user interaction in that a victim must open a malicious file.",
