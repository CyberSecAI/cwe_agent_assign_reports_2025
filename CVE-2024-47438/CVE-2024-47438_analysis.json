  "description": "Substance3D - Painter versions 10.1.0 and earlier are affected by a **Write-what-where Condition** vulnerability that could lead to a **memory leak**. This vulnerability allows an attacker to write a controlled value at a controlled memory location, which could result in the disclosure of sensitive memory content. Exploitation of this issue requires user interaction in that a victim must open a malicious file.",

CWE-401, **Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime**, is a potential secondary weakness given the **memory leak** impact. CWE-123 can potentially lead to memory corruption, which could lead to a **memory leak**, making CWE-401 a consequence.

This leads to memory corruption, which results in CWE-401 (**memory leak**) and potentially the disclosure of sensitive memory content.\n\nCWE-123 (Root Cause) -> Memory Corruption -> CWE-401 (Impact)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe primary CWE is CWE-123 (**Write-what-where Condition**) because the vulnerability description and CVE summary explicitly state this condition. The description states \"Substance3D - Painter versions 10.1.0 and earlier are affected by a **Write-what-where Condition** vulnerability...\". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also confirms this, stating \"\"vulnerability\": \"Write-what-where Condition\", \"cwe_id\": \"CWE-123\"\".\n\nCWE-401 (**Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime**) is a secondary consideration due to the mention of a **memory leak**. The description states that the \"Write-what-where Condition\" can lead to a **memory leak**, and the CVE summary also confirms this, stating \"\"impact\": \"Memory leak\"\". While the primary cause is the **Write-what-where Condition**, the **memory leak** suggests a failure to properly manage allocated memory after its use.\n\nThe other CWEs considered were less relevant. CWE-787 (**Out-of-bounds Write**) is related to CWE-123 but less specific. CWE-120 (**Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input**) implies a buffer copy operation, which isn't explicitly mentioned. CWE-190 (**Integer Overflow or Wraparound**) and CWE-122 (**Heap-based Buffer Overflow**) are not directly supported by the provided vulnerability information.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-123 being a base CWE that directly describes the root cause and CWE-401 being a variant CWE that describes the impact.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-123: Write-what-where Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nAny condition where the attacker has the ability to write an arbitrary value to an arbitrary location, often as the result of a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-401: Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 1.000\n**Source**: alternate_terms\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release memory after it has been used, which can lead to a denial of service (DoS) condition due to resource exhaustion.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.",
