## Vulnerability Description
There is a **Hard-coded Cryptographic Key** in Docusnap 13.0.1440.24261, and earlier and later versions. This key can be used to decrypt inventory files that contain sensitive information such as firewall rules.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **Hard-coded Cryptographic Key**
- **impact:** decrypt inventory files that contain sensitive information
- **product:** Docusnap
- **version:** 13.0.1440.24261 and earlier and later versions

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
```text
Root cause of vulnerability:
*   The Docusnap client software encrypts inventory files with a static AES key for Windows systems and a hardcoded RSA private key for Linux systems. The decryption key can be obtained from the .NET application, downloadable from the vendor’s website.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
*   Information Disclosure: Inventory files created by Docusnap, containing information like installed programs, firewall rules and local administrators, are encrypted with a static key.

Impact of exploitation:
*   Attackers with read access to Docusnap inventory files are able to decrypt its contents. This discloses information that can be used for further attacks.

Attack vectors:
*   The vulnerability can be exploited by any domain user who has read access to the encrypted inventory files, as Docusnap recommends giving modify permissions to the AD group “Authenticated Users.” Since modify permissions include read permissions, this means every domain user has access to the encrypted inventory files.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
*   An attacker needs read access to the encrypted inventory files.

Mitigation or fix:
*   The ACL of the file share should be adjusted to prevent read access to the inventory files created on other computers.
*   Attackers should not be able read the clear text inventory files. This can for example be achieved by using an asymmetric encryption method with unique keys for each installation. Another option would be to prevent users from reading the inventory files.
