CWE-862 is also considered as a contributing factor since the exposure happens due to a **missing** authorization check. While CWE-862 is a class-level CWE, it accurately reflects that there is **missing** authorization. CWE-200 is a class-level CWE and could have more specific children, but the description directly matches the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe862 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe862 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **missing** authorization (CWE-862), which leads to the exposure of sensitive information (CWE-200). The **root cause** is the **lack** of proper authorization checks, and the impact is the disclosure of private post titles.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis indicates that the Easy Digital Downloads plugin is vulnerable to **Sensitive Information Exposure** because it **fails** to properly authorize access to private post titles, allowing unauthenticated attackers to extract this information.\n\nCWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) is the primary CWE because the vulnerability description explicitly states \"**Sensitive Information Exposure**\". The description of CWE-200, \"The product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information,\" directly matches the vulnerability.\n\nCWE-862 (Missing Authorization) is a secondary CWE because the exposure of information occurs due to the **lack** of an authorization check. The description of CWE-862, \"The product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action,\" aligns with the vulnerability, as unauthenticated attackers can access private post titles without proper authorization.\n\nThe retriever results also support these selections. CWE-200 and CWE-862 are among the top CWEs suggested.\n\nOther CWEs Considered:\n- CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function): While authentication is related to authorization, the vulnerability description focuses more on the authorization aspect after a user (or lack thereof) is accessing a specific function.\n- CWE-359 (Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor): This is more specific than CWE-200, but the description doesn't explicitly state the information is private or personal, just sensitive.\n- CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key): Not applicable as there's no mention of key modification for authorization bypass.",
