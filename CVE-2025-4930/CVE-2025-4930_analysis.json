Here's the extracted information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\n* A SQL injection vulnerability was found in the '/my-cart.php' file of the 'Online Shopping Portal' project. The reason for this issue is that attackers inject malicious code from the parameter 'billingaddress' and use it directly in SQL queries without the need for appropriate cleaning or validation.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n* SQL injection\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n* Attackers can exploit this SQL injection vulnerability to achieve unauthorized database access, sensitive data leakage, data tampering, comprehensive system control, and even service interruption.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n* The '/my-cart.php' file is vulnerable.\n* The 'billingaddress' parameter is the entry point for the attack.\n* No login or authorization is required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n* An attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to '/my-cart.php' with a crafted 'billingaddress' parameter. No authentication is required.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n* Use prepared statements and parameter binding.\n* Input validation and filtering.\n* Minimize database user permissions.\n* Regular security audits.\n\n**Payload Example:**\n\n```\nParameter: billingaddress (POST)\n    Type: time-based blind\n    Title: MySQL >= 5.0.12 AND time-based blind (query SLEEP)\n    Payload: quantity[15]=1&billingaddress=111' AND (SELECT 3183 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))AQkU) AND 'xRpg'='xRpg&bilingstate=11&billingcity=11&billingpincode=11&update=&shippingaddress=11&shippingstate=11&shippingcity=1&shippingpincode=1\n```\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   **Affected Product:** Online Shopping Portal V1.0\n*   **Vulnerable File:** /my-cart.php\n*   **Software Link:** <https://www.campcodes.com/downloads/complete-online-shopping-portal-using-php-and-mysql-source-code/?wpdmdl=5515&ind=0>\n*   The content includes a command example using `sqlmap` for exploitation.\n*   Screenshots of sqlmap output are provided.",

CWE-89 is a specific type of injection, making it a more precise classification than its parent.

The evidence is strong, with the vulnerability description and the CVE reference both explicitly stating the presence of **SQL injection**. The retriever results also strongly suggest CWE-89 as the primary candidate.
