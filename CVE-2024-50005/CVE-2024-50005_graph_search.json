According to RCU usage rules, this is illegal and can lead to unpredictable behavior, such as accessing memory that has been updated or causing use-after-free issues. This possible bug was identified using a static analysis tool developed by myself, specifically designed to detect RCU-related issues. To address this, the `scan_req->type` value is now stored in a local variable `scan_req_type` while still within the RCU read-side critical section. The `scan_req_type` is then used after the RCU lock is released, ensuring that the type value is safely accessed without violating RCU rules. Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-908 CWE-476 CWE-843 CWE-770 CWE-362 CWE-911 CWE-667 CWE-863",
