# Vulnerability Description

    A **command injection** vulnerability exists in the gradio-app/gradio repository, specifically within the test-functional.yml workflow. The vulnerability arises due to **improper neutralization of special elements** used in a command, allowing for unauthorized modification of the base repository or secrets exfiltration. The issue affects versions up to and including @gradio/video@0.6.12. The flaw is present in the workflows handling of GitHub context information, where it echoes the full name of the head repository, the head branch, and the workflow reference without adequate sanitization. This could potentially lead to the exfiltration of sensitive secrets such as GITHUB_TOKEN, COMMENT_TOKEN, and CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN.
