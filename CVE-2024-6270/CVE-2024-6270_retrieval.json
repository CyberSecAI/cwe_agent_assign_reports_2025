Specifically, the plugin does not properly handle user-supplied input when saving stylesheet settings.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\\n- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS issue. Malicious JavaScript code can be injected through the plugin\\'s settings page.\\n\\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\\n- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the browsers of other users who access the WordPress admin dashboard. This could lead to:\\n    - Account takeover (admin or other high-privilege users)\\n    - Defacement of the website\\n    - Redirection to malicious websites\\n    - Data theft\\n    - Other malicious actions\\n\\n**Attack Vectors:**\\n- The attack vector is through the plugin\\'s stylesheet settings page within the WordPress admin panel. An attacker can insert a malicious payload into a settings field.\\n\\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\\n- The attacker needs to have administrator-level or equivalent privileges on the WordPress site to access the plugin\\'s settings page and inject the payload.\\n- The attacker does not need to have the `unfiltered_html` capability. The vulnerability exists even when this capability is disallowed.\\n\\n**Technical Details:**\\n- The proof of concept demonstrates the injection of `</textarea><script>alert(1)</script>` into a stylesheet field.\\n- The vulnerability exists in versions of the plugin prior to 1.5.1', similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {95: {'cwe_counts': defaultdict(<class 'int'>, {'CWE-79': 1}), 'total_samples': 4, 'distribution': [{'cwes': [], 'frequency': 3, 'proportion': 0.75}, {'cwes': ['CWE-79'], 'frequency': 1, 'proportion': 0.25}]}, 90: {'cwe_counts': defaultdict(<class 'int'>, {'CWE-79': 1}), 'total_samples': 4, 'distribution': [{'cwes': [], 'frequency': 3, 'proportion': 0.75}, {'cwes': ['CWE-79'], 'frequency': 1, 'proportion': 0.25}]}, 85: {'cwe_counts': defaultdict(<class 'int'>, {'CWE-79': 2}), 'total_samples': 9, 'distribution': [{'cwes': [], 'frequency': 7, 'proportion': 0.778}, {'cwes': ['CWE-79'], 'frequency': 2, 'proportion': 0.222}]}, 80: {'cwe_counts': defaultdict(<class 'int'>, {'CWE-79': 2}), 'total_samples': 6, 'distribution': [{'cwes': [], 'frequency': 4, 'proportion': 0.667}, {'cwes': ['CWE-79'], 'frequency': 2, 'proportion': 0.333}]}, 75: {'cwe_counts': defaultdict(<class 'int'>, {'CWE-79': 5}), 'total_samples': 9, 'distribution': [{'cwes': ['CWE-79'], 'frequency': 5, 'proportion': 0.556}, {'cwes': [], 'frequency': 4, 'proportion': 0.444}]}, 70: {'cwe_counts': defaultdict(<class 'int'>, {'CWE-79': 4}), 'total_samples': 12, 'distribution': [{'cwes': [], 'frequency': 8, 'proportion': 0.667}, {'cwes': ['CWE-79'], 'frequency': 4, 'proportion': 0.333}]}}, 'cwe_consensus': 'CWE-79', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [95, 90, 85, 80, 75, 70], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {95: 4, 90: 4, 85: 9, 80: 6, 75: 9, 70: 12}, 'top_cwes_by_threshold': {95: [('CWE-79', 1)], 90: [('CWE-79', 1)], 85: [('CWE-79', 2)], 80: [('CWE-79', 2)], 75: [('CWE-79', 5)], 70: [('CWE-79', 4)]}}, 'raw_matches': [{'similarity': 95, 'cwes': [], 'total': 4, 'frequency': 3, 'proportion': 0.75}, {'similarity': 95, 'cwes': ['79'], 'total': 4, 'frequency': 1, 'proportion': 0.25}, {'similarity': 90, 'cwes': [], 'total': 4, 'frequency': 3, 'proportion': 0.75}, {'similarity': 90, 'cwes': ['79'], 'total': 4, 'frequency': 1, 'proportion': 0.25}, {'similarity': 85, 'cwes': [], 'total': 9, 'frequency': 7, 'proportion': 0.778}, {'similarity': 85, 'cwes': ['79'], 'total': 9, 'frequency': 2, 'proportion': 0.222}, {'similarity': 80, 'cwes': [], 'total': 6, 'frequency': 4, 'proportion': 0.667}, {'similarity': 80, 'cwes': ['79'], 'total': 6, 'frequency': 2, 'proportion': 0.333}, {'similarity': 75, 'cwes': ['79'], 'total': 9, 'frequency': 5, 'proportion': 0.556}, {'similarity': 75, 'cwes': [], 'total': 9, 'frequency': 4, 'proportion': 0.444}, {'similarity': 70, 'cwes': [], 'total': 12, 'frequency': 8, 'proportion': 0.667}, {'similarity': 70, 'cwes': ['79'], 'total': 12, 'frequency': 4, 'proportion': 0.333}]}, similarity_summary=SimilarityInsight(consensus_cwe='CWE-79', top_cwes=[('CWE-79', 15)], confidence_levels={'high': [], 'medium': [], 'low': []}, total_samples=44), analysis='', analysis_with_relationships='', criticism='', resolution='', relevant_cwes=[{'metadata': {'doc_id': '352', 'name': 'Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'rootcause:does not sanitise and escape some of its settings', 'keyphrase': 'does not sanitise and escape some of its settings', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'rootcause:lack of sanitization and escaping', 'keyphrase': 'lack of sanitization and escaping', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'weakness:cross-site scripting', 'keyphrase': 'cross-site scripting', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'impact:Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks', 'keyphrase': 'Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks', 'type': 'impact'}, {'id': 'attacker:high privilege users', 'keyphrase': 'high privilege users', 'type': 'attacker'}, {'id': 'product:Community Events WordPress plugin', 'keyphrase': 'Community Events WordPress plugin', 'type': 'product'}, {'id': 'version:before 1.5.1', 'keyphrase': 'before 1.5.1', 'type': 'version'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(568.5526470296916)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '116', 'name': 'Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
