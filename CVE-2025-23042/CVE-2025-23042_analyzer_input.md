# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-23042

## Vulnerability Description
Gradio is an open-source Python package that allows quick building of demos and web application for machine learning models, API, or any arbitrary Python function. Gradios Access Control List (ACL) for file paths can be bypassed by altering the letter case of a blocked file or directory path. This vulnerability arises due to the lack of case normalization in the file path validation logic. On case-insensitive file systems, such as those used by Windows and macOS, this flaw enables attackers to circumvent security restrictions and access sensitive files that should be protected. This issue can lead to unauthorized data access, exposing sensitive information and undermining the integrity of Gradios security model. Given Gradios popularity for building web applications, particularly in machine learning and AI, this vulnerability may pose a substantial threat if exploited in production environments. This issue has been addressed in release version 5.6.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## CVE-2025-23042 - Gradio Blocked Path ACL Bypass Vulnerability

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability arises from a lack of case normalization in the file path validation logic within Gradio's Access Control List (ACL) for file paths. The `is_allowed_file` function and its reliance on `is_in_or_equal` do not handle case variations in paths on case-insensitive file systems.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Case-insensitive file path handling.
*   ACL bypass due to case alteration.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Unauthorized Access: Sensitive files or directories specified in `blocked_paths` can be accessed by attackers.
*   Data Exposure: Critical files, such as configuration files or user data, may be leaked.
*   Security Breach: This can lead to broader application or system compromise if sensitive files contain credentials or API keys.

**Attack vectors:**

*   Accessing sensitive files using a case-altered path via HTTP requests (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:PORT/gradio_api/file=resources/adMin/credential.txt`).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to construct and send HTTP requests to the Gradio application.
*   Knowledge of the blocked paths and the ability to manipulate the case of the path in the request.
*   The application must be deployed on a case-insensitive file system (Windows, macOS).

**Mitigation or fix:**

1.  **Normalize Path Case**: Convert both the requested path and the blocked paths to a consistent case (e.g., lowercase) before evaluating them against the ACL.
2.  **Update Documentation**: Warn developers about potential risks when deploying Gradio on case-insensitive file systems.
3.  **Release Security Patches**: Release an updated version of Gradio with the fixed logic.

**Affected versions:**

< 5.6.0

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control

**Authentication**:
Determines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.

* Example phrases: "user must log in", "lack of login check", "bypasses login"
* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.

  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* – used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).

**Authorization**:
Determines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do. It decides access *after* identity is verified.

* Example phrases: "unauthorized access", "regular user can access admin panel", "role checks are missing"
* CWE relevance: use CWEs like 862, 863, 285 for authorization errors:

  * **CWE-862**: *Missing Authorization* – the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all.
  * **CWE-863**: *Incorrect Authorization* – the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).
  * **CWE-285**: *Improper Authorization* – general category for any flawed authorization logic or design.

**Access Control**:
A broader term that includes both authentication and authorization. Governs how resources are protected and who can access them under what conditions.

* CWE relevance:

  * **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* – top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear.
  * This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.

## Mapping Discussion – Common Misclassification Patterns

### 1. **CWE-306 vs CWE-862**:

* **306** is about lack of **authentication** (e.g., *no login required at all*).
* **862** is about lack of **authorization** *after* authentication (e.g., *admin check missing*).
* ✅ Example CWE-306: *“An unauthenticated attacker can invoke the password reset API.”*
* ✅ Example CWE-862: *“An authenticated user without admin privileges can delete any user account.”*

### 2. **CWE-285 vs CWE-284**:

* **285** is specific to authorization flaws – it's a better choice than 284 **if** the issue involves *improper or missing role checks*.
* **284** should be reserved for general access control issues when it’s unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.

---

## Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification

**Phrase like "unauthorized access" is not enough.**

* If you **cannot determine whether identity was checked**, assume it’s **authorization** and consider 862 or 863.
* If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** → CWE-306.
* If the **access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced**, but it's not due to missing checks, consider **CWE-284**.

---

## Good Mapping Examples

* ✅ **CWE-306**: “The endpoint `/admin/deleteUser` does not require any authentication.”
* ✅ **CWE-862**: “Any logged-in user can change any other user's email without being an admin.”
* ✅ **CWE-863**: “An admin check exists but incorrectly grants access to non-admin users.”
* ✅ **CWE-285**: “Application uses a static role check that fails when roles change dynamically.”
* ✅ **CWE-284**: “Inconsistent enforcement of access rules across services with unclear policy source.”
