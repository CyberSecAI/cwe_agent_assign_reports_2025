## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
```
- Root cause of vulnerability: Path traversal vulnerability in LibreOffice when handling embedded font files.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: An attacker can craft a document with malicious embedded font file path names.
- Impact of exploitation: This could cause LibreOffice to write the contents of the embedded font to a filename in an arbitrary location the user has permission to write to, although always with a ".ttf" suffix.
- Attack vectors: Crafting malicious documents with specifically crafted embedded font file path names.
