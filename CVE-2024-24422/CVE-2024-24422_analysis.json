This means CWE-121 provides a more specific characterization of the vulnerability, since it is constrained to stack-based buffer overflows.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe121[\"CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    \n    cwe121 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe121 primary\n    class cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is as follows:\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** A **stack overflow** occurs in the `decode_protocol_configuration_options` function.\n2.  **Vulnerability:** This **stack overflow** is triggered by a crafted NAS packet.\n3.  **Impact:** This leads to a Denial of Service (DoS).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that a **stack overflow** exists in the `decode_protocol_configuration_options` function, which can be triggered by a crafted NAS packet, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS).
