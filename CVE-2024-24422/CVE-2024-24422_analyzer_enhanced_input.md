# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
A stack-based buffer overflow condition is a condition where the buffer being overwritten is allocated on the stack (i.e., is a local variable or, rarely, a parameter to a function).

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Stack Overflow: "Stack Overflow" is often used to mean the same thing as stack-based buffer overflow, however it is also used on occasion to mean stack exhaustion, usually a result from an excessively recursive function call. Due to the ambiguity of the term, use of stack overflow to describe either circumstance is discouraged.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-788
ChildOf -> CWE-787

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Other]** Stack-based buffer overflows can instantiate in return address overwrites, stack pointer overwrites or frame pointer overwrites. They can also be considered function pointer overwrites, array indexer overwrites or write-what-where condition, etc.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-35395:** Stack-based buffer overflows in SFK for wifi chipset used for IoT/embedded devices, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.




## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product performs a calculation that can
         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic
         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than
         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is
         incremented to a value that is too large to store in the
         associated representation. When this occurs, the value may
         become a very small or negative number.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Overflow: The terms "overflow" and "wraparound" are used interchangeably by some people, but they can have more precise distinctions by others. See Terminology Notes.
Wraparound: The terms "overflow" and "wraparound" are used interchangeably by some people, but they can have more precise distinctions by others. See Terminology Notes.
wrap, wrap-around, wrap around: Alternate spellings of "wraparound"

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-682
ChildOf -> CWE-682
ChildOf -> CWE-20
CanPrecede -> CWE-119

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Be careful of terminology problems with "overflow," "underflow," and "wraparound" - see Terminology Notes. Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use
**Suggested Alternatives:**
- CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound). Consider CWE-191 when the result is less than the minimum value that can be represented (sometimes called "underflows").


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Integer overflows can be primary to buffer overflows when they cause less memory to be allocated than expected.

**[Terminology]** 

"Integer overflow" is sometimes used to cover several types of errors, including signedness errors, or buffer overflows that involve manipulation of integer data types instead of characters. Part of the confusion results from the fact that 0xffffffff is -1 in a signed context. Other confusion also arises because of the role that integer overflows have in chains.


A "wraparound" is a well-defined, standard behavior that follows specific rules for how to handle situations when the intended numeric value is too large or too small to be represented, as specified in standards such as C11.


"Overflow" is sometimes conflated with "wraparound" but typically indicates a non-standard or undefined behavior.


The "overflow" term is sometimes used to indicate cases where either the maximum or the minimum is exceeded, but others might only use "overflow" to indicate exceeding the maximum while using "underflow" for exceeding the minimum.


Some people use "overflow" to mean any value outside the representable range - whether greater than the maximum, or less than the minimum - but CWE uses "underflow" for cases in which the intended result is less than the minimum.


See [REF-1440] for additional explanation of the ambiguity of terminology.


**[Other]** While there may be circumstances in which the logic intentionally relies on wrapping - such as with modular arithmetic in timers or counters - it can have security consequences if the wrap is unexpected. This is especially the case if the integer overflow can be triggered using user-supplied inputs.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-43537:** Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)
- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).
- **CVE-2022-0545:** Chain: 3D renderer has an integer overflow (CWE-190) leading to write-what-where condition (CWE-123) using a crafted image.




## CWE-674: Uncontrolled Recursion
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not properly control the amount of recursion that takes place,  consuming excessive resources, such as allocated memory or the program stack.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Stack Exhaustion

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-834

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2007-1285:** Deeply nested arrays trigger stack exhaustion.
- **CVE-2007-3409:** Self-referencing pointers create infinite loop and resultant stack exhaustion.
- **CVE-2016-10707:** Javascript application accidentally changes input in a way that prevents a recursive call from detecting an exit condition.




## CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
A heap overflow condition is a buffer overflow, where the buffer that can be overwritten is allocated in the heap portion of memory, generally meaning that the buffer was allocated using a routine such as malloc().

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-788
ChildOf -> CWE-787

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Heap-based buffer overflows are usually just as dangerous as stack-based buffer overflows.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-43537:** Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)
- **CVE-2007-4268:** Chain: integer signedness error (CWE-195) passes signed comparison, leading to heap overflow (CWE-122)
- **CVE-2009-2523:** Chain: product does not handle when an input string is not NULL terminated (CWE-170), leading to buffer over-read (CWE-125) or heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).




## CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties.

### Extended Description


Specified quantities include size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, and others. Code may rely on specified quantities to allocate resources, perform calculations, control iteration, etc. When the quantity is not properly validated, then attackers can specify malicious quantities to cause excessive resource allocation, trigger unexpected failures, enable buffer overflows, etc.

### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** This entry is still under development and will continue to see updates and content improvements.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).
- **CVE-2008-1440:** lack of validation of length field leads to infinite loop
- **CVE-2008-2374:** lack of validation of string length fields allows memory consumption or buffer over-read




## CWE-401: Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not sufficiently track and release allocated memory after it has been used, which slowly consumes remaining memory.

### Extended Description
This is often triggered by improper handling of malformed data or unexpectedly interrupted sessions. In some languages, developers are responsible for tracking memory allocation and releasing the memory. If there are no more pointers or references to the memory, then it can no longer be tracked and identified for release.

### Alternative Terms
Memory Leak

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-772
ChildOf -> CWE-404
ChildOf -> CWE-404

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed

**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This is often a resultant weakness due to improper handling of malformed data or early termination of sessions.

**[Terminology]** "memory leak" has sometimes been used to describe other kinds of issues, e.g. for information leaks in which the contents of memory are inadvertently leaked (CVE-2003-0400 is one such example of this terminology conflict).



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2005-3119:** Memory leak because function does not free() an element of a data structure.
- **CVE-2004-0427:** Memory leak when counter variable is not decremented.
- **CVE-2002-0574:** chain: reference count is not decremented, leading to memory leak in OS by sending ICMP packets.




## CWE-1339: Insufficient Precision or Accuracy of a Real Number
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product processes a real number with an implementation in which the number's representation does not preserve required accuracy and precision in its fractional part, causing an incorrect result.

### Extended Description


When a security decision or calculation requires highly precise, accurate numbers such as financial calculations or prices, then small variations in the number could be exploited by an attacker. 


There are multiple ways to store the fractional part of a real number in a computer. In all of these cases, there is a limit to the accuracy of recording a fraction. If the fraction can be represented in a fixed number of digits (binary or decimal), there might not be enough digits assigned to represent the number. In other cases the number cannot be represented in a fixed number of digits due to repeating in decimal or binary notation (e.g. 0.333333...) or due to a transcendental number such as Π or √2. Rounding of numbers can lead to situations where the computer results do not adequately match the result of sufficiently accurate math.

- **CVE-2017-7619:** Chain: rounding error in floating-point calculations (CWE-1339) in image processor leads to infinite loop (CWE-835)
- **CVE-2021-29529:** Chain: machine-learning product can have a heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122) when some integer-oriented bounds are calculated by using ceiling() and floor() on floating point values (CWE-1339)




## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.

### Extended Description

- **CVE-2020-11899:** Out-of-bounds read in IP stack used in embedded systems, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2014-0160:** Chain: "Heartbleed" bug receives an inconsistent length parameter (CWE-130) enabling an out-of-bounds read (CWE-126), returning memory that could include private cryptographic keys and other sensitive data.




## CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product allocates a reusable resource or group of resources on behalf of an actor without imposing any restrictions on the size or number of resources that can be allocated, in violation of the intended security policy for that actor.

### Extended Description


Code frequently has to work with limited resources, so programmers must be careful to ensure that resources are not consumed too quickly, or too easily. Without use of quotas, resource limits, or other protection mechanisms, it can be easy for an attacker to consume many resources by rapidly making many requests, or causing larger resources to be used than is needed. When too many resources are allocated, or if a single resource is too large, then it can prevent the code from working correctly, possibly leading to a denial of service.


### Alternative Terms

**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This entry is different from uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400) in that there are other weaknesses that are related to inability to control resource consumption, such as holding on to a resource too long after use, or not correctly keeping track of active resources so that they can be managed and released when they are finished (CWE-771).

**[Theoretical]** Vulnerability theory is largely about how behaviors and resources interact. "Resource exhaustion" can be regarded as either a consequence or an attack, depending on the perspective. This entry is an attempt to reflect one of the underlying weaknesses that enable these attacks (or consequences) to take place.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).
- **CVE-2009-4017:** Language interpreter does not restrict the number of temporary files being created when handling a MIME request with a large number of parts..
- **CVE-2009-2726:** Driver does not use a maximum width when invoking sscanf style functions, causing stack consumption.




## CWE-835: Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')
