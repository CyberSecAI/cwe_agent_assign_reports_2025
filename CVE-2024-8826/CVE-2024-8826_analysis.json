  "description": "PDF-XChange Editor XPS File Parsing **Out-Of-Bounds Read** Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of PDF-XChange Editor. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of XPS files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated object. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-24305.",

It can be caused by CWE-20 **Improper Input Validation**, which is a class level CWE. Although CWE-20 is listed as discouraged, it aligns with the provided root cause evidence.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n\n    cwe125 <--|CAUSED_BY| cwe20\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe125 primary\n    class cwe20 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper input validation** (CWE-20) which leads to an **out-of-bounds read** (CWE-125) and results in potential remote code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description states that the issue is an \"PDF-XChange Editor XPS File Parsing **Out-Of-Bounds Read** Remote Code Execution Vulnerability\", and further specifies that the **rootcause** is a \"**lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**\". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms these findings with the following entry:\n`\"Root cause of vulnerability\": \"The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of XPS files, leading to a read past the end of an allocated object.\"`\n`\"Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present\": \"Out-of-bounds read vulnerability.\"`\n\nBased on the vulnerability description and supporting evidence, the primary CWE is CWE-125 **Out-of-bounds Read** (Base) because the weakness is directly related to a read operation occurring outside the intended boundaries of a buffer.
