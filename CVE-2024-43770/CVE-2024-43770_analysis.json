CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input) can precede CWE-787 because **missing bounds check** relates to input validation which can cause out-of-bounds write.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    cwe1284[\"CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe1284 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe787\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe119,cwe1284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing bounds check** (potentially linked to CWE-1284), leading to an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787), and culminating in remote code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly indicates an out-of-bounds write due to a **missing bounds check** in the `gatts_process_find_info` function of `gatt_sr.cc`. The key phrases \"out of bounds write\" and \"**missing bounds check**\" are strong indicators for CWE-787. The absence of a proper bounds check directly leads to the possibility of writing beyond the allocated buffer.\n\nThe retriever results also support the selection of CWE-787 with other potentially related CWEs. CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input) is considered as a secondary CWE because the **missing bounds check** is about validating the input quantity (size or length).\n\nCWE-120 was considered and deemed less appropriate because the description does not explicitly mention a buffer copy operation.
