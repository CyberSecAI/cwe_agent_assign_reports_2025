This implies a network-based attack.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- The attacker needs to be able to access the vulnerable examples web application. This would typically be over the network.\n\n**Affected Versions:**\n- Apache Tomcat 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.1\n- Apache Tomcat 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.33\n- Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 through 9.0.97\n\n**Resolution:**\n- Upgrade to Apache Tomcat version 11.0.2, 10.1.34, or 9.0.98 to fix the issue.",
