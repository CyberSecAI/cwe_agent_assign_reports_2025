# Analysis for CVE-2024-40324

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-93 | Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection') | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE: The root cause of the vulnerability is the **improper neutralization of CRLF sequences** in user-supplied input. |
| CWE-113 | Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting') | 1.0 | Variant | Allowed | Secondary CWE: The **CRLF injection** leads to **HTTP response splitting**, which is a direct consequence of the improper neutralization. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is **CWE-93 (Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection'))**, as it represents the root cause of the vulnerability: the failure to properly sanitize CRLF characters in user-supplied input. This leads directly to **CWE-113 (Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting'))**, a variant that describes the specific impact of CRLF injection in the context of HTTP headers, causing HTTP response splitting. CWE-93 is a parent of CWE-113.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **improper neutralization of CRLF sequences (CWE-93)**. This allows attackers to inject CRLF characters into HTTP headers, resulting in **HTTP response splitting (CWE-113)** and header manipulation.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description, which explicitly states a **CRLF injection** vulnerability leading to **HTTP response splitting** and header manipulation. The key is to identify the root cause and subsequent impact.

**CWE-93** is selected as the primary CWE because it represents the **root cause**: the **improper neutralization of CRLF sequences**. The description clearly states that the application fails to properly handle CRLF characters in input fields.

**CWE-113** is selected as a secondary CWE because it describes the specific impact of the CRLF injection in the context of HTTP headers, resulting in **HTTP response splitting**. This is a direct consequence of the root cause.

The retriever scores and the relationship analysis (CWE-113 being a child of CWE-93) support this classification. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-93 being a Base CWE and CWE-113 being a Variant CWE.

CWEs considered but not used:
*   CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection'): This is a high-level class and less specific than CWE-93.
*   CWE-444: Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request/Response Smuggling'): This is related to HTTP request handling but doesn't directly represent the CRLF injection.
*   CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting'): This is related to XSS vulnerabilities and not directly applicable to CRLF injection.
*   CWE-117: Improper Output Neutralization for Logs: This is about logging and not directly related to HTTP response splitting.
*   CWE-644: Improper Neutralization of HTTP Headers for Scripting Syntax: While related to HTTP headers, it's specifically about scripting syntax and not the general CRLF injection.

Relevant CWE Information:
# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.



## CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives data from an HTTP agent/component (e.g., web server, proxy, browser, etc.), but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CR and LF characters before the data is included in outgoing HTTP headers.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as "<", ">", and "&" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.



## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names. The associated manipulations are intended to generate multiple names for the same object.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
