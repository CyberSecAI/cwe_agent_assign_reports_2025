## Vulnerability Description
Multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities exist in the internet.cgi set_qos() functionality of Wavlink AC3000 M33A8.V5030.210505. A specially crafted HTTP request can lead to stack-based buffer overflow. An attacker can make an authenticated HTTP request to trigger these vulnerabilities.This vulnerability exists in the `cli_mac` POST parameter.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2024-39769 Content

This content is **RELEVANT** to CVE-2024-39769. It provides a detailed vulnerability report from Cisco Talos.

Here's an extraction of the relevant information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   Buffer overflow vulnerabilities in the `internet.cgi set_qos()` functionality due to unrestricted input length for POST parameters `cli_name`, `cli_mac`, and `en_enable`. The `strcat` function is used without checking the size of the input, leading to potential buffer overflows.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   CWE-120 - Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input (‘Classic Buffer Overflow’)
*   Stack-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   The vulnerabilities "easily lead to the return address of the function being overwritten by arbitrary attacker-controlled data, leading to code execution." (High impact - CVSSv3 score of 9.1)

**Attack vectors:**

*   An attacker can make an authenticated HTTP request to trigger these vulnerabilities.
*   Specifically, a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `internet.cgi` script with the `page=qos` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   Authenticated access to the Wavlink AC3000 router's web interface.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   The report does not explicitly state a fix, but implies patching is required. The vendor was contacted and is working on patches (as of November 4, 2024).
*   The product has been discontinued, but patches are being worked on.

**Additional Details (more detail than official CVE description):**

*   **Affected Product:** Wavlink AC3000 M33A8.V5030.210505
*   **Vulnerable Function:** `set_qos()` in `internet.cgi`
*   **Specific vulnerable parameters:** `cli_name`, `cli_mac`, and `en_enable`
*   **Detailed code snippets:** The report includes code snippets showing the vulnerable `strcat` calls.
*   **Crash Information:** GDB crash information is provided.
*   **Timeline:** A timeline of vendor communication is included.
*   **Discovered by:** Lilith of Cisco Talos.
