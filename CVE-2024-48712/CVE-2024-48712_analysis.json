CWE-121 is more specific as it identifies the buffer is allocated on the stack. CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) can result from a stack-based buffer overflow.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe121[\"CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    \n    cwe121 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe121 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe787\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe121 primary\n    class cwe787 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper handling** of the string name parameter within the `rtRuleJsonToBin` function, **lacking proper bounds checking**. This **lack of validation** leads to a **stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121)**, which subsequently allows an attacker to perform an **out-of-bounds write (CWE-787)**, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that the `rtRuleJsonToBin` function in TP-Link TL-WDR7660 1.0 **does not check** the parameter string name, resulting in a **stack overflow**. The primary weakness is CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow), as it accurately describes the **root cause**. The retriever results also list CWE-121 as the top candidate.
