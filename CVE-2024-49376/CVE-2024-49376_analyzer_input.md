# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-49376

## Vulnerability Description
Autolab, a course management service that enables auto-graded programming assignments, has **misconfigured reset password permissions** in version 3.0.0. For email-based accounts, users with insufficient privileges could reset and theoretically access privileged users accounts by resetting their passwords. This issue is fixed in version 3.0.1. No known workarounds exist.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **misconfigured reset password permissions**
- **impact:** access privileged users accounts
- **attacker:** users with insufficient privileges
- **product:** Autolab
- **version:** 3.0.0

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-49376

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from misconfigured reset password permissions. Specifically, the issue was in the `UsersController` of the Autolab application where the `update_password_for_user` action, responsible for handling the actual password change, did not have proper authorization checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Privilege Check:**  The `update_password_for_user` action lacked sufficient authorization checks. This allowed users with inadequate privileges to attempt to change passwords of other users, even those with higher privileges. This bypasses the intended access control mechanisms.
- **Direct Access:** The controller action could be accessed directly without the appropriate authorization level checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Account Takeover:**  An attacker could reset the password of a privileged user account by exploiting the vulnerability, potentially gaining access to sensitive data or functionalities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct Request to Password Update Endpoint:** An attacker could craft a request directly to the vulnerable `update_password_for_user` action.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to the application:** An attacker needs to have an account on the Autolab application, even with basic privileges, to attempt password reset for other users.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is present in Autolab version `3.0.0`.
- The fix is implemented in version `3.0.1`.
- The vulnerability affects email-based accounts and allows users to reset the passwords of other users with higher privileges.

**Code Changes (from commit):**
The code diff shows that the following line:
`action_auth_level :update_password_for_user, :administrator`
was added, enforcing the `administrator` authorization level for the password update action.
This change enforces that only users with administrator level permissions can change the passwords of other users.

**Credits:**
- The vulnerability was reported by HenryHuang2004.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* 🔍 *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* 🔍 *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion – CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### 🔸 CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ✅ *“A user created with the ‘guest’ role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ✅ *“The backup service runs as root but only needs read access.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ⚠️ This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### 🔸 CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ✅ *“User can access another user’s invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.”*

## Mapping Examples – Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *“User can escalate privileges to admin.”*
> ❌ Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged – only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ✅ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**

## Good Mapping Examples – Privileges & Permissions

* ✅ **CWE-266**: *“When a new user registers, the system assigns them admin role due to a missing role validation.”*
* ✅ **CWE-250**: *“Installer runs with system-level privileges but doesn't require them to install files in the user directory.”*
* ✅ **CWE-284**: *“Inconsistent access rules between UI and backend for sensitive endpoints.”*
* ✅ **CWE-285**: *“Authorization logic fails to restrict access to finance reports based on department.”*
