  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved wifi mt76 mt7921s fix potential hung tasks during chip recovery During chip recovery (e.g. chip reset), there is a possible situation that kernel worker reset_work is holding the lock and waiting for kernel thread stat_worker to be parked, while stat_worker is waiting for the release of the same lock. It causes a **deadlock** resulting in the dumping of hung tasks messages and possible rebooting of the device. This patch prevents the execution of stat_worker during the chip recovery.",

CWE-667 (Improper Locking) and CWE-362 (Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')) are Class level CWEs and are related to CWE-833. CWE-667 can be a parent of CWE-609 (Double-Checked Locking). CWE-362 can be a parent of CWE-367 (Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe833[\"CWE-833: Deadlock\"]\n    cwe667[\"CWE-667: Improper Locking\"]\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n\n    cwe833 -->|PART_OF| cwe667\n    cwe833 -->|PART_OF| cwe362\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe833 primary\n    class cwe667,cwe362 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with concurrent execution and improper locking, leading to a **deadlock**, and ultimately resulting in hung tasks and potential device reboot.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference links. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions a **deadlock** as the **weakness**. The CVE reference summary details that the **root cause** is a **deadlock** occurring during chip recovery due to improper locking and lack of synchronization between `reset_work` and `stat_worker`.\n\nThe retriever results list CWE-833 (Deadlock) as the top candidate, which aligns with the vulnerability description. Other candidates like CWE-667 (Improper Locking) and CWE-362 (Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')) are also relevant as contributing factors leading to the deadlock.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-833 being a Base level CWE that directly represents the **deadlock** condition.
