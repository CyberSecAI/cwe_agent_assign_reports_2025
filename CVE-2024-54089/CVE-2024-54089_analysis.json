The vulnerability description explicitly mentions a \"hard-coded key\" as the basis for the **weak encryption mechanism**. |\n| CWE-326 | Inadequate Encryption Strength | 0.7 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary Candidate. While the description mentions a **weak encryption mechanism**, CWE-326 is a more general classification. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship that influenced the decision was the ChildOf relationship between CWE-321 and CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials). While CWE-798 is also a relevant candidate, CWE-321 is a more specific variant that directly addresses the use of a hard-coded cryptographic key, which is the root cause described in the vulnerability. CWE-326 (Inadequate Encryption Strength) is a higher-level Class that describes the resulting weakness, but lacks the specificity of CWE-321.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe321[\"CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key\"]\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    cwe326[\"CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength\"]\n\n    cwe321 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n    cwe321 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe656\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe321 primary\n    class cwe798,cwe326 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **root cause**, the use of a **hard-coded cryptographic key** (CWE-321). This leads to a **weak encryption mechanism**, resulting in the ability for an attacker to guess or decrypt the password. The **inadequate encryption strength** (CWE-326) is a consequence of using the hard-coded key.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the **root cause** of the vulnerability. The vulnerability description explicitly states that the issue is a **weak encryption mechanism** based on a **hard-coded key**. The Retriever results and Complete CWE Specifications were reviewed to find the most appropriate CWE.\n\nThe primary CWE selected is CWE-321 (Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key) because it directly matches the **root cause** described in the vulnerability. The evidence is strong, as the vulnerability description explicitly mentions a **hard-coded key**. CWE-326 (Inadequate Encryption Strength) was considered as a secondary candidate because it describes the resulting weakness, but it is less specific than CWE-321.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the decision by highlighting the ChildOf relationship between CWE-321 and CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials). While CWE-798 is also relevant, CWE-321 is a more specific variant that directly addresses the use of a hard-coded cryptographic key.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-321 directly addresses the **root cause** described in the vulnerability, while CWE-326 describes the resulting weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.

Once detected, it can be difficult to fix, so the administrator may be forced into disabling the product entirely. There are two main variations:\n\n```\n\t\tInbound: the product contains an authentication mechanism that checks for a hard-coded password.\n\t\tOutbound: the product connects to another system or component, and it contains hard-coded password for connecting to that component.\n```\nIn the Inbound variant, a default administration account is created, and a simple password is hard-coded into the product and associated with that account. This hard-coded password is the same for each installation of the product, and it usually cannot be changed or disabled by system administrators without manually modifying the program, or otherwise patching the product. If the password is ever discovered or published (a common occurrence on the Internet), then anybody with knowledge of this password can access the product. Finally, since all installations of the product will have the same password, even across different organizations, this enables massive attacks such as worms to take place.\n\nThe Outbound variant applies to front-end systems that authenticate with a back-end service. The back-end service may require a fixed password which can be easily discovered. The programmer may simply hard-code those back-end credentials into the front-end product. Any user of that program may be able to extract the password. Client-side systems with hard-coded passwords pose even more of a threat, since the extraction of a password from a binary is usually very simple.\n",
