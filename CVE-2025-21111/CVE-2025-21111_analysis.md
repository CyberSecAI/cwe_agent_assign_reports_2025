# Analysis for CVE-2025-21111

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-256 | Plaintext Storage of a Password | 1.0 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-497 | Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere | 0.7 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship observed is that CWE-256 is a specific type of vulnerability related to how passwords are handled. The weakness leads to exposure of sensitive information, which can be represented by CWE-497. CWE-256 directly describes the **rootcause**, while CWE-497 represents a potential impact. Other CWEs like CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials) are more general classes that could encompass CWE-256. The abstraction level guided the selection towards the base level CWE-256 for the **rootcause**.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **Plaintext Storage of a Password** (CWE-256). This **rootcause** directly leads to the potential exposure of sensitive system information (CWE-497) to an attacker who has local access and high privileges. Therefore, the chain is: CWE-256 -> CWE-497.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment pointed towards **CWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password)** as the primary weakness, which aligns with the provided vulnerability description and the extracted root cause information. The retriever results also strongly support this assessment, with CWE-256 being ranked as the top match.

The analysis also considered other CWEs, especially those related to credential management and information exposure. However, CWE-256 provides the most specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability, focusing on the **rootcause**.

The final decision is based on direct evidence from the vulnerability description ("Plaintext Storage of a Password") and the CVE reference summary ("Root cause of vulnerability: Plaintext Storage of a Password"). The relationships between CWEs, particularly the parent-child relationship between CWE-256 and CWE-522, and the potential impact of information exposure (CWE-497) further solidified the choice of CWE-256 as the primary weakness. Other potential CWEs were considered but deemed less specific or representative of the core issue. CWE-497 was chosen as a secondary CWE to represent the potential impact of the vulnerability.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
Storing a password in plaintext may result in a system compromise.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product transmits or stores authentication credentials, but it uses an insecure method that is susceptible to unauthorized interception and/or retrieval.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).



## CWE-257: Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The storage of passwords in a recoverable format makes them subject to password reuse attacks by malicious users. In fact, it should be noted that recoverable encrypted passwords provide no significant benefit over plaintext passwords since they are subject not only to reuse by malicious attackers but also by malicious insiders. If a system administrator can recover a password directly, or use a brute force search on the available information, the administrator can use the password on other accounts.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel
