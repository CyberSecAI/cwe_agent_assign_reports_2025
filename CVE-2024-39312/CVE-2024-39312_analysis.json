  "description": "Botan is a C++ cryptography library. X.509 certificates can identify elliptic curves using either an object identifier or using explicit encoding of the parameters. A **bug in the parsing of name constraint extensions** in X.509 certificates meant that if the extension included both permitted subtrees and excluded subtrees, only the permitted subtree would be checked. If a certificate included a name which was permitted by the permitted subtree but also excluded by excluded subtree, it would be accepted. Fixed in versions 3.5.0 and 2.19.5.",

  "reference_content": "- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A bug in the parsing of name constraint extensions in X.509 certificates. Specifically, if the extension included both permitted subtrees and excluded subtrees, only the permitted subtree was checked.\n- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper validation of X.509 certificate name constraint extensions, specifically when both permitted and excluded subtrees are present.\n- **Impact of exploitation**: A certificate containing a name that should have been excluded by the excluded subtree, but was permitted by the permitted subtree, would be incorrectly accepted. This could lead to the acceptance of unauthorized certificates. The integrity of the system is impacted since unauthorized certificates could potentially be used.\n- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attacks using maliciously crafted X.509 certificates.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs the ability to generate X.509 certificates that have both permitted and excluded subtrees, and have the target application process these certificates. No user interaction is required and no privileges are required.",

CWE-297 is a more specific variant of CWE-295, indicating a host mismatch issue in certificate validation. Since the vulnerability description mentions parsing of name constraint extensions, which relates to validation, CWE-295 is highly relevant. The issue of permitted and excluded subtrees not being checked properly points toward a validation problem.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe295[\"CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation\"]\n    cwe297[\"CWE-297: Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch\"]\n    \n    cwe297 -->|CHILDOF| cwe295\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe295 primary\n    class cwe297 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **bug in the parsing of name constraint extensions** (CWE-Other). This leads to **improper validation** (CWE-295) of the certificate, and specifically, **improper validation when there is a host mismatch** (CWE-297 is a possible secondary factor). The final impact is accepting a certificate which should have been excluded, thus impacting system integrity.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary assessment is based on the provided evidence, which highlights a **bug in parsing** leading to **improper validation** of X.509 certificates. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" clearly states the **root cause** as a bug in the parsing of name constraint extensions and the **weakness** as improper validation.\n\nThe graph relationships show how specific validation issues can arise from general certificate validation problems. The selection of CWE-295 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **improper validation** aspect. CWE-297 is a secondary consideration because the description doesn't explicitly mention host mismatch, but it is still a valid concern since the validation problem lies in the name constraint extensions.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not validate, or incorrectly validates, a certificate.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-297: Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product communicates with a host that provides a certificate, but the product does not properly ensure that the certificate is actually associated with that host.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1286: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input that is expected to be well-formed - i.e., to comply with a certain syntax - but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input complies with the syntax.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
