## Vulnerability Description
The Meteobridge web interface let meteobridge administrator manage their weather station data collection and administer their meteobridge system through a web application written in CGI shell scripts and C. This web interface exposes an endpoint that is vulnerable to **command injection**. Remote unauthenticated attackers can gain arbitrary command execution with elevated privileges ( root ) on affected devices.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **command injection**
- **impact:** arbitrary command execution
- **attacker:** Remote unauthenticated attackers
- **product:** Meteobridge

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Security Advisory: Remote Command Execution on Smartbedded MeteoBridge (CVE-2025-4008)

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   Insecure use of `eval` calls in the `template.cgi` script. User-controlled input from `$QUERY_STRING` is parsed and used unsanitized in an `eval` call.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Command Injection
*   Authentication Bypass (due to the CGI script being accessible in an unprotected directory - "public")

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Remote unauthenticated attackers can gain arbitrary command execution with root privileges on affected devices.

**Attack vectors:**

*   Network-accessible web interface (Internet exposure is a precondition).
*   HTTP GET request to `/cgi-bin/template.cgi` with a malicious `templatefile` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   No authentication required.
*   Network access to the Meteobridge device.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   Upgrade to version 6.2 or later.
*   Avoid exposing the Meteobridge to the Internet. Operate it within a LAN only, without remote access.

**Additional details (more than official CVE description):**

*   **Affected versions:** <= 6.1
*   **CVSS Score:** 8.7 (High) - CVSS:4.0/AV:A/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N
*   The vulnerability was discovered through automated bash static code analysis performed by ONEKEY.
*   Timeline of disclosure is provided, including attempts to contact the vendor and notification to the German BSI.
*   Proof of concept examples (curl commands) are provided.
*   Devices are reportedly visible on Shodan, indicating potential internet exposure.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set ‚Äì Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* üîç *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* üîç *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion ‚Äì CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### üî∏ CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ‚úÖ *‚ÄúA user created with the ‚Äòguest‚Äô role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.‚Äù*

#### üî∏ CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ‚úÖ *‚ÄúThe backup service runs as root but only needs read access.‚Äù*

#### üî∏ CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### üî∏ CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ‚úÖ *‚ÄúUser can access another user‚Äôs invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.‚Äù*

## Mapping Examples ‚Äì Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *‚ÄúUser can escalate privileges to admin.‚Äù*
> ‚ùå Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged ‚Äì only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ‚úÖ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**

## Good Mapping Examples ‚Äì Privileges & Permissions

* ‚úÖ **CWE-266**: *‚ÄúWhen a new user registers, the system assigns them admin role due to a missing role validation.‚Äù*
* ‚úÖ **CWE-250**: *‚ÄúInstaller runs with system-level privileges but doesn't require them to install files in the user directory.‚Äù*
* ‚úÖ **CWE-284**: *‚ÄúInconsistent access rules between UI and backend for sensitive endpoints.‚Äù*
* ‚úÖ **CWE-285**: *‚ÄúAuthorization logic fails to restrict access to finance reports based on department.‚Äù*
