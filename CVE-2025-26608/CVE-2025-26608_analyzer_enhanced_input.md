## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Here's an analysis of the provided content:

*   **Content Relates to CVE-2025-26608:** YES
*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Lack of input validation in the `dependente_docdependente.php` endpoint allows SQL injection. Specifically, the parameters `id_dependente` and `id_doc` are vulnerable.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection (CWE-89) and improper access control (CWE-284).
*   **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   Retrieving sensitive data.
    *   DoS attack (dropping SQL tables).
    *   Potentially arbitrary file upload.
*   **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted POST request to the `dependente_docdependente.php` endpoint with malicious SQL code in the `id_dependente` or `id_doc` parameters.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint. The vulnerability can be exploited without authentication due to the redirect not terminating code execution.
*   **Mitigation or fix:** The patched version is 3.2.13. The content suggests that the remediation developer is GabrielPintoSouza.
*   **More detail than the official CVE description:** The content provides a specific vulnerable endpoint, parameters, and PoC examples (using curl). It also provides CVSS v4 base metrics.
