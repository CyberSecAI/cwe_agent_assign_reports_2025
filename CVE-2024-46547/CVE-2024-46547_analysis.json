  "description": "A vulnerability was found in Romain Bourdon Wampserver all versions (discovered in v3.2.3 and v3.2.6) where unauthorized users could access sensitive information due to **improper access control validation** via PHP Info Page. This issue can lead to data leaks.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n- Improper access control validation in wampserver's PHP Info Page. Specifically, the vulnerability arises because wampserver does not properly restrict access to the phpinfo page.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to access sensitive information exposed by the PHP info page.\n- **Missing Access Control:** There's a lack of proper access control mechanisms to protect the phpinfo page, which should ideally be restricted to authorized users only.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Data Leaks:**  Sensitive data about the organization using Wampserver can be exposed, including configuration details, server environment information, and potentially application settings.\n- **High Impact:** The document itself categorizes the impact as \"High\".\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Network Access:** The attack vector is through network access to the Wampserver.\n- **Direct URL Access:** Specifically, accessing the PHP info page with a specific URL, such as `http://<IP>:<Port>/?phpinfo=-1`\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Wampserver instance.\n- **Knowledge of Vulnerable URL:** The attacker needs to be aware of the specific URL path to access the PHP info page (e.g., `/?phpinfo=-1`).\n- **Shodan or Similar:** The attacker can potentially use Shodan to identify publicly exposed Wampserver instances.",

CWE-306 (Missing Authentication) is a base-level CWE that accurately reflects the root cause. While CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) is a broader category, the specifics of the vulnerability description point to a complete lack of authentication, making CWE-306 more appropriate. CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) describes the resulting impact and has a peer relationship with other information exposure CWEs, suggesting its relevance as a secondary concern.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe425[\"CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\"]\n\n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe425 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe306 primary\n    class cwe200,cwe425 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the **missing authentication** (CWE-306) for the PHP Info Page, which leads to **exposure of sensitive information** (CWE-200) to unauthorized users. The attack vector is a **direct request** (CWE-425) to the vulnerable page.\n\nCWE-306 (Missing Authentication) -> CWE-200 (Information Exposure)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The description clearly states that the issue is due to **improper access control validation** and **missing access control**. Given the guidance on Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control, the more precise issue is that there is **no authentication** required to access the PHP Info Page. This directly aligns with CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function).\n\nCWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) is included because the vulnerability leads to the exposure of sensitive information. CWE-425 is included as a secondary weakness because it represents the specific attack vector of directly requesting the vulnerable page.\n\nThe selection of CWE-306 is at the optimal level of specificity because it accurately captures the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the absence of authentication for a critical function. The other considered CWEs, such as CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) and CWE-284 (Improper Access Control), are less specific and don't fully represent the nature of the weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
