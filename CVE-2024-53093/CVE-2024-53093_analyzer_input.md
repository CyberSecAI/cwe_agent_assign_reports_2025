# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-53093

## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved nvme-multipath defer partition scanning We need to suppress the partition scan from occuring within the controllers scan_work context. If a path error occurs here, the IO will wait until a path becomes available or all paths are torn down, but that action also occurs within scan_work, so it would **deadlock**. Defer the partion scan to a different context that does not block scan_work.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **deadlock**
- **product:** Linux kernel
- **component:** nvme-multipath

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, this content relates to **CVE-2024-53093**.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the partition scan occurring within the controller's `scan_work` context in the NVMe multipath driver. If a path error occurs during the scan, the IO would wait for a path to become available. However, path error handling also occurs within `scan_work`, leading to a potential deadlock.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Deadlock: The core issue is a deadlock condition where the partition scan, waiting for IO path availability, is blocked by the same `scan_work` context that handles path errors, thus preventing the availability of a path.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- System deadlock: Exploiting this vulnerability would cause a system deadlock, rendering the system unresponsive.

**Attack vectors:**
- Path errors: Triggering a path error during the NVMe multipath partition scan will cause the deadlock.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to cause path errors: An attacker needs the ability to create path errors within the NVMe multipath subsystem. This is a scenario that can occur within normal system operation, if underlying storage has issues.

**Additional details:**
- The fix involves deferring the partition scan to a separate workqueue context (`kblockd_schedule_work`) that does not block the controller's `scan_work` context.
- The fix introduces a new work item `partition_scan_work` and the `GD_SUPPRESS_PART_SCAN` flag.
- This fix applies to the Linux kernel's NVMe multipath driver.
