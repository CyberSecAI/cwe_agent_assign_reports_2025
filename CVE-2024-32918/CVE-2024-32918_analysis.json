CWE-325 is a Base level CWE which helps identify the root cause. While CWE-863 and CWE-306 are related to authorization and authentication, they are not as precise in describing the **missing cryptographic step**. CWE-325 directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability, where a necessary cryptographic operation is skipped, leading to a bypass of HDCP 2.2 encryption.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe325[\"CWE-325: Missing Cryptographic Step\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    \n    cwe863 -->|PEEROF| cwe306\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe325 primary\n    class cwe863,cwe306 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing cryptographic step**, leading to the bypass of HDCP 2.2 encryption.\n  - **Root Cause:** CWE-325: Missing Cryptographic Step\n  - **Weakness:** Failure to complete HDCP Key Exchange initialization\n  - **Impact:** Permission Bypass, disabling HDCP 2.2 encryption\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the description indicates a **missing step** in the HDCP Key Exchange, which points directly to cryptographic flaws. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" supports a root cause within the Trusty component, leading to information disclosure, and an attack vector within that component.\n\nCWE-325, *Missing Cryptographic Step*, is the most accurate because the vulnerability stems from the **failure to complete the HDCP Key Exchange initialization steps**, directly impacting the cryptographic process. The \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" identifies the **rootcause** as \"**not completing the HDCP Key Exchange initialization steps**\". This aligns with the **missing** aspect of CWE-325.\n\nCWE-863, *Incorrect Authorization*, and CWE-306, *Missing Authentication for Critical Function*, were considered but are less precise. While the vulnerability leads to a permission bypass, the underlying cause is the **missing cryptographic step**, not necessarily a flaw in the authorization or authentication logic itself.\n\nThe selection of CWE-325 is at the optimal level of specificity because it clearly identifies the root cause as a **missing step** in the cryptographic process. The evidence clearly supports this classification with a confidence level of 0.8.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1204: Generation of Weak Initialization Vector (IV)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.167\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nCWE-1204: Generation of Weak Initialization Vector (IV)\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Relationships**:\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-329\n- CHILDOF -> CWE-330\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-1204\n- CHILDOF -> CWE-1204\n\n## CWE-325: Missing Cryptographic Step\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.152\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nCWE-325: Missing Cryptographic Step\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-602: Client-Side Enforcement of Server-Side Security\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.137\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nCWE-602: Client-Side Enforcement of Server-Side Security\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-338: Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.136\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nCWE-338: Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Relationships**:\n- CHILDOF -> CWE-330\n- CHILDOF -> CWE-330\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-338\n\n## CWE-841: Improper Enforcement of Behavioral Workflow\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.135\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nCWE-841: Improper Enforcement of Behavioral Workflow\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.131\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nCWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Relationships**:\n- CANFOLLOW -> CWE-656\n- CHILDOF -> CWE-798\n- CHILDOF -> CWE-798\n- CHILDOF -> CWE-798\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-321\n\n## CWE-665: Improper Initialization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.127\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nCWE-665: Improper Initialization\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-415: Double Free\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.125\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nCWE-415: Double Free\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-289: Authentication Bypass by Alternate Name\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.500\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nCWE-289: Authentication Bypass by Alternate Name\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.002\n**Source**: graph\n\n**Description**:\nCWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Relationships**:\n- CANPRECEDE -> CWE-98\n- CANPRECEDE -> CWE-471\n- CHILDOF -> CWE-424\n- CHILDOF -> CWE-288\n- CHILDOF -> CWE-862\n\n## CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 2.40\n**Source**: graph\n\n**Description**:\nCWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n-",
