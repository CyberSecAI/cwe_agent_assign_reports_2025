# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-1204: Generation of Weak Initialization Vector (IV)
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses a cryptographic primitive that uses an Initialization
			Vector (IV), but the product does not generate IVs that are
			sufficiently unpredictable or unique according to the expected
			cryptographic requirements for that primitive.
			

### Extended Description
By design, some cryptographic primitives (such as block ciphers) require that IVs must have certain properties for the uniqueness and/or unpredictability of an IV. Primitives may vary in how important these properties are. If these properties are not maintained, e.g. by a bug in the code, then the cryptography may be weakened or broken by attacking the IVs themselves.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-330

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** As of CWE 4.5, terminology related to randomness, entropy, and predictability can vary widely. Within the developer and other communities, "randomness" is used heavily. However, within cryptography, "entropy" is distinct, typically implied as a measurement. There are no commonly-used definitions, even within standards documents and cryptography papers. Future versions of CWE will attempt to define these terms and, if necessary, distinguish between them in ways that are appropriate for different communities but do not reduce the usability of CWE for mapping, understanding, or other scenarios.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2020-1472:** ZeroLogon vulnerability - use of a static IV of all zeroes in AES-CFB8 mode
- **CVE-2011-3389:** BEAST attack in SSL 3.0 / TLS 1.0. In CBC mode, chained initialization vectors are non-random, allowing decryption of HTTPS traffic using a chosen plaintext attack.
- **CVE-2001-0161:** wireless router does not use 6 of the 24 bits for WEP encryption, making it easier for attackers to decrypt traffic




## CWE-325: Missing Cryptographic Step
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not implement a required step in a cryptographic algorithm, resulting in weaker encryption than advertised by the algorithm.

**[Relationship]** Can be resultant.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2001-1585:** Missing challenge-response step allows authentication bypass using public key.




## CWE-602: Client-Side Enforcement of Server-Side Security
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product is composed of a server that relies on the client to implement a mechanism that is intended to protect the server.

### Extended Description
When the server relies on protection mechanisms placed on the client side, an attacker can modify the client-side behavior to bypass the protection mechanisms, resulting in potentially unexpected interactions between the client and server. The consequences will vary, depending on what the mechanisms are trying to protect.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-693
CanPrecede -> CWE-471
PeerOf -> CWE-290
PeerOf -> CWE-300

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-33139:** SCADA system only uses client-side authentication, allowing adversaries to impersonate other users.
- **CVE-2006-6994:** ASP program allows upload of .asp files by bypassing client-side checks.
- **CVE-2007-0163:** steganography products embed password information in the carrier file, which can be extracted from a modified client.




## CWE-338: Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses a Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) in a security context, but the PRNG's algorithm is not cryptographically strong.

### Extended Description


When a non-cryptographic PRNG is used in a cryptographic context, it can expose the cryptography to certain types of attacks.


Often a pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) is not designed for cryptography. Sometimes a mediocre source of randomness is sufficient or preferable for algorithms that use random numbers. Weak generators generally take less processing power and/or do not use the precious, finite, entropy sources on a system. While such PRNGs might have very useful features, these same features could be used to break the cryptography.

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-3692:** PHP framework uses mt_rand() function (Marsenne Twister) when generating tokens
- **CVE-2009-3278:** Crypto product uses rand() library function to generate a recovery key, making it easier to conduct brute force attacks.
- **CVE-2009-3238:** Random number generator can repeatedly generate the same value.




## CWE-841: Improper Enforcement of Behavioral Workflow
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product supports a session in which more than one behavior must be performed by an actor, but it does not properly ensure that the actor performs the behaviors in the required sequence.

### Extended Description


By performing actions in an unexpected order, or by omitting steps, an attacker could manipulate the business logic of the product or cause it to enter an invalid state. In some cases, this can also expose resultant weaknesses.


For example, a file-sharing protocol might require that an actor perform separate steps to provide a username, then a password, before being able to transfer files. If the file-sharing server accepts a password command followed by a transfer command, without any username being provided, the product might still perform the transfer.


Note that this is different than CWE-696, which focuses on when the product performs actions in the wrong sequence; this entry is closely related, but it is focused on ensuring that the actor performs actions in the correct sequence.


Workflow-related behaviors include:


  - Steps are performed in the expected order.

  - Required steps are not omitted.

  - Steps are not interrupted.

  - Steps are performed in a timely fashion.



### Alternative Terms

**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Research Gap]** 

This weakness is typically associated with business logic flaws, except when it produces resultant weaknesses.


The classification of business logic flaws has been under-studied, although exploitation of business flaws frequently happens in real-world systems, and many applied vulnerability researchers investigate them. The greatest focus is in web applications. There is debate within the community about whether these problems represent particularly new concepts, or if they are variations of well-known principles.


Many business logic flaws appear to be oriented toward business processes, application flows, and sequences of behaviors, which are not as well-represented in CWE as weaknesses related to input validation, memory management, etc.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2011-0348:** Bypass of access/billing restrictions by sending traffic to an unrestricted destination before sending to a restricted destination.
- **CVE-2007-3012:** Attacker can access portions of a restricted page by canceling out of a dialog.
- **CVE-2009-5056:** Ticket-tracking system does not enforce a permission setting.




## CWE-289: Authentication Bypass by Alternate Name
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product performs authentication based on the name of a resource being accessed, or the name of the actor performing the access, but it does not properly check all possible names for that resource or actor.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-1390

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Overlaps equivalent encodings, canonicalization, authorization, multiple trailing slash, trailing space, mixed case, and other equivalence issues.

**[Theoretical]** Alternate names are useful in data driven manipulation attacks, not just for authentication.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2003-0317:** Protection mechanism that restricts URL access can be bypassed using URL encoding.
- **CVE-2004-0847:** Bypass of authentication for files using "\" (backslash) or "%5C" (encoded backslash).




## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.

### Extended Description
Web applications susceptible to direct request attacks often make the false assumption that such resources can only be reached through a given navigation path and so only apply authorization at certain points in the path.

### Alternative Terms
forced browsing: The "forced browsing" term could be misinterpreted to include weaknesses such as CSRF or XSS, so its use is discouraged.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-862
ChildOf -> CWE-862
ChildOf -> CWE-288
ChildOf -> CWE-424
CanPrecede -> CWE-471
CanPrecede -> CWE-98

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Overlaps Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID), authorization errors, container errors; often primary to other weaknesses such as XSS and SQL injection.

**[Theoretical]** "Forced browsing" is a step-based manipulation involving the omission of one or more steps, whose order is assumed to be immutable. The application does not verify that the first step was performed successfully before the second step. The consequence is typically "authentication bypass" or "path disclosure," although it can be primary to all kinds of weaknesses, especially in languages such as PHP, which allow external modification of assumed-immutable variables.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-29238:** Access-control setting in web-based document collaboration tool is not properly implemented by the code, which prevents listing hidden directories but does not prevent direct requests to files in those directories.
- **CVE-2022-23607:** Python-based HTTP library did not scope cookies to a particular domain such that "supercookies" could be sent to any domain on redirect.
- **CVE-2004-2144:** Bypass authentication via direct request.




## CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The use of a hard-coded cryptographic key significantly increases the possibility that encrypted data may be recovered.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Other]** The main difference between the use of hard-coded passwords and the use of hard-coded cryptographic keys is the false sense of security that the former conveys. Many people believe that simply hashing a hard-coded password before storage will protect the information from malicious users. However, many hashes are reversible (or at least vulnerable to brute force attacks) -- and further, many authentication protocols simply request the hash itself, making it no better than a password.

**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-29960:** Engineering Workstation uses hard-coded cryptographic keys that could allow for unathorized filesystem access and privilege escalation
- **CVE-2022-30271:** Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) uses a hard-coded SSH private key that is likely to be used by default.
- **CVE-2020-10884:** WiFi router service has a hard-coded encryption key, allowing root access




## CWE-665: Improper Initialization
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not initialize or incorrectly initializes a resource, which might leave the resource in an unexpected state when it is accessed or used.

### Extended Description
This can have security implications when the associated resource is expected to have certain properties or values, such as a variable that determines whether a user has been authenticated or not.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-664

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2001-1471:** chain: an invalid value prevents a library file from being included, skipping initialization of key variables, leading to resultant eval injection.
- **CVE-2008-3637:** Improper error checking in protection mechanism produces an uninitialized variable, allowing security bypass and code execution.
- **CVE-2008-4197:** Use of uninitialized memory may allow code execution.




## CWE-415: Double Free
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product calls free() twice on the same memory address, potentially leading to modification of unexpected memory locations.

### Extended Description
When a program calls free() twice with the same argument, the program's memory management data structures become corrupted. This corruption can cause the program to crash or, in some circumstances, cause two later calls to malloc() to return the same pointer. If malloc() returns the same value twice and the program later gives the attacker control over the data that is written into this doubly-allocated memory, the program becomes vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack.

### Alternative Terms
Double-free

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-825
ChildOf -> CWE-1341
ChildOf -> CWE-672
ChildOf -> CWE-672
ChildOf -> CWE-672
ChildOf -> CWE-666
PeerOf -> CWE-416
PeerOf -> CWE-123

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This is usually resultant from another weakness, such as an unhandled error or race condition between threads. It could also be primary to weaknesses such as buffer overflows.

**[Theoretical]** It could be argued that Double Free would be most appropriately located as a child of "Use after Free", but "Use" and "Release" are considered to be distinct operations within vulnerability theory, therefore this is more accurately "Release of a Resource after Expiration or Release", which doesn't exist yet.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2006-5051:** Chain: Signal handler contains too much functionality (CWE-828), introducing a race condition (CWE-362) that leads to a double free (CWE-415).
- **CVE-2004-0642:** Double free resultant from certain error conditions.
- **CVE-2004-0772:** Double free resultant from certain error conditions.
