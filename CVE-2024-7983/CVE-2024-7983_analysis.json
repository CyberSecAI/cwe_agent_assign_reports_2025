CWE-306 describes the **missing authentication**, which allows an attacker to send a **maliciously crafted payload**. This payload then leads to CWE-400, **uncontrolled resource consumption**, ultimately causing a denial of service. CWE-306 is the root cause, while CWE-400 is a consequence.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n\n    cwe400 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe306\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe306 primary\n    class cwe400 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authentication** (CWE-306) on the markdown to HTML conversion endpoint. This allows an attacker to send a **maliciously crafted markdown payload**. The server then spends excessive time converting the payload without any restrictions, leading to **uncontrolled resource consumption** (CWE-400) and a denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is the **missing authentication** for the markdown to HTML conversion endpoint, which allows an attacker to exhaust server resources. This is clearly a case of CWE-306, as the endpoint is exposed without any identity validation. The resulting denial of service, due to the excessive resource consumption, can be represented by CWE-400. The selection is primarily based on the clear evidence of an **unauthenticated endpoint** and its direct consequence of resource exhaustion. The retriever results and the authentication vs authorization guidance both support the selection of CWE-306. The specificity of CWE-306 and CWE-400 accurately captures the root cause and impact of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-610: Externally Controlled Reference to a Resource in Another Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an externally controlled name or reference that resolves to a resource that is outside of the intended control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
