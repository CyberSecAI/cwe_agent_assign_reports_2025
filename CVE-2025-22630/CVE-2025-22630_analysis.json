Because the vulnerability specifically involves OS commands, CWE-78 is a more precise classification. CWE-88 is also a child of CWE-77 and represents a specific type of command injection, but it is not clear if argument delimiters are the specific issue.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: OS Command Injection\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Command Injection\"]\n    cwe88[\"CWE-88: Argument Injection\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\"]\n\n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n    cwe88 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n    cwe77 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe77,cwe88 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper neutralization of special elements** in a command, leading directly to OS command injection.

OS Command Injection (Impact)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"**Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command** (Command Injection) vulnerability ... allows OS Command Injection.\" The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also states the root cause is categorized as an \"Injection\" vulnerability.\n\nGiven the explicit mention of \"OS Command Injection\" and \"**Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command**\", CWE-78 is the most appropriate primary CWE.
