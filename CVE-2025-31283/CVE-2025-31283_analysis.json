The analysis also considers the child CWEs and related Base level CWEs to pinpoint the root cause. CWE-266 (Incorrect Privilege Assignment) is considered as a contributing factor. The choice of CWE-863 reflects the vulnerability's core issue, which is an incorrect authorization check.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe266[\"CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\"]\n\n    cwe266 -->|CAN_ALSO_BE| cwe863\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe266 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **incorrect authorization**, leading to potential privilege escalation. Specifically, an administrator could create users with the ability to change roles, ultimately leading to escalated privileges. The chain is as follows:\n1.  **Incorrect Authorization (CWE-863)**: The system incorrectly authorizes the creation of users with certain capabilities.\n2.  Incorrect Privilege Assignment (CWE-266): The newly created user is assigned privileges to change the role of accounts.\n3.  Privilege Escalation (Impact): The user escalates privileges due to the ability to change roles.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis focuses on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability based on the description and extracted key phrases. The primary CWE, CWE-863, directly addresses the **incorrect authorization** issue, where the system fails to properly check the authorization of user creation, leading to potential privilege escalation. The evidence from the provided content, especially the \"Root cause of vulnerability: Several broken access control vulnerabilities previously discovered in Trend Vision One,\" supports this classification.\n\nCWE-266 (Incorrect Privilege Assignment) is also considered because the users created by the admin are given the ability to change roles, which is an incorrect privilege assignment.\n\nThe selection of CWE-863 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it captures the core issue of the **incorrect authorization** in the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
