  "description": "A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, has been found in code-projects Responsive Hotel Site 1.0. Affected by this issue is some unknown functionality of the file /admin/room.php. The manipulation of the argument troom leads to **sql injection**. The attack may be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n- The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the `room.php` file of the \"Responsive Hotel Site Using PHP With Source Code\" project. The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization or validation of the `troom` parameter before using it in SQL queries. This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **SQL Injection:** The application directly incorporates user-supplied input (from the `troom` parameter) into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization, leading to a SQL injection vulnerability.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Unauthorized database access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database.\n- **Sensitive data leakage:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database.\n- **Data tampering:** Attackers can modify or delete data within the database.\n- **Comprehensive system control:**  In severe cases, attackers might gain broader control over the system.\n- **Service interruption:** Exploitation could lead to a disruption of the application's service.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- The vulnerability is exploited through an HTTP POST request to `room.php`.\n- The malicious SQL code is injected via the `troom` parameter.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.\n- No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability. The attacker can be an unauthenticated user\n\n**Additional Details:**\n- The provided content includes Proof-of-Concept (PoC) payloads for different types of SQL injection techniques:\n    - Boolean-based blind SQL injection\n    - Error-based SQL injection\n    - Time-based blind SQL injection\n- The content includes specific examples of exploitation using `sqlmap`, further confirming the vulnerability.\n\n**Suggested Repair:**\n- The following are the suggested repair from the content.\n    1.  **Use prepared statements and parameter binding:** Use prepared statements to separate SQL code from user input data.\n    2.  **Input validation and filtering:** Validate and filter user input to ensure it conforms to the expected format.\n    3.  **Minimize database user permissions:** Use accounts with minimum necessary permissions for database connection and avoid using accounts with advanced permissions (such as' root 'or' admin ').\n    4.  **Regular security audits:** Regularly conduct code and system security audits to promptly identify and fix potential security vulnerabilities.",
