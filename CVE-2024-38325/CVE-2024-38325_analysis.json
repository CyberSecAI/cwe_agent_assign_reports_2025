CWE-200 was considered as a potential impact, but it is a high-level class and its usage is discouraged as it represents the impact rather than the root cause.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe319 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe319 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **sending network requests over an insecure channel** (CWE-319), which leads to the impact of **obtaining sensitive information** (CWE-200).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-319 as the most relevant CWE due to the **root cause** being the **transmission of sensitive information in cleartext**. This directly matches the description of CWE-319. The retriever results also support this selection, listing CWE-319 as the top candidate.\n\nThe relationship analysis shows that CWE-319 can precede CWE-200, which aligns with the vulnerability description where the **cleartext transmission** leads to the **exposure of sensitive information**.\n\nThe final decision is based on the evidence that the **root cause** of the vulnerability is the **sending network requests over an insecure channel**, which resulted in the potential exposure of sensitive information.
