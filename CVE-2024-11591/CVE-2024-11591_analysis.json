  "description": "A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, was found in 1000 Projects Beauty Parlour Management System 1.0. This affects an unknown part of the file /admin/add-services.php. The manipulation of the argument sername leads to **sql injection**. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in the GitHub issue, which is related to a SQL injection in the \"Beauty Parlour Management System PHP SQLite Project\":\n\n**Root Cause:**\n- The vulnerability is due to insufficient user input validation of the `sername` parameter in the `admin/add-services.php` file.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **SQL Injection:** Malicious SQL queries can be injected through the `sername` parameter because user-supplied input is directly used in SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.\n- **Lack of Input Validation/Sanitization:** The application does not properly validate or sanitize user-provided data before using it in SQL queries, leading to the injection vulnerability.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Unauthorized Database Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database.\n- **Sensitive Data Leakage:** Attackers can potentially leak sensitive information from the database.\n- **Data Tampering:** Attackers can modify or delete data in the database.\n- **Comprehensive System Control:** Exploitation can lead to gaining full control of the system.\n- **Service Interruption:** Attackers can potentially disrupt or halt the service/application.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- The attack vector is the `sername` parameter of the `admin/add-services.php` script, which is vulnerable to SQL injection.\n- The attacker sends a crafted HTTP POST request containing malicious SQL code within the `sername` parameter.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the webserver.\n- The attacker does not require prior authentication to exploit the vulnerability.\n\n**Technical Details:**\n- The vulnerability is a time-based blind SQL injection.\n- The provided payload demonstrates how an attacker could use the `SLEEP()` function in MySQL to test for injection and exploit the vulnerability:\n```\nsername=1111111' AND (SELECT 6074 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))aOPX) AND 'lear'='lear&cost=1111111&submit=\n```\n- The SQLMAP tool was used for testing and demonstrating the vulnerability.\n```\nsqlmap -u \"http://10.211.55.6:1112/admin/add-services.php\" --cookie=\"PHPSESSID=hmbfn5n9cu9uiq2n60sohgnito\" --data=\"sername=1111111&cost=1111111&submit=\" --batch --dbms=mysql --level=5 --risk=3 --dbs --random-agent\n```\n\n**Suggested Remediation:**\n1. **Use prepared statements with parameter binding:** This method separates SQL code from the user-provided data, preventing injection.\n2. **Input validation and filtering:** User inputs should be strictly validated and filtered.\n3. **Minimize database user permissions:** The database connection should use an account with minimal required permissions.\n4. **Regular security audits:** Conduct regular code and system security audits to discover and fix vulnerabilities promptly.\n\nThe content aligns with the vulnerability type described in the CVE description, as the CVE description is a placeholder and the content describes a SQL injection vulnerability.",

The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that user-supplied input is directly used in SQL queries without proper sanitization, leading to the injection vulnerability.\n\nThe retriever results also strongly support CWE-89 as the primary weakness.
