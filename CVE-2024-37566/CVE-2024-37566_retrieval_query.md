# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.

### Extended Description


Because the information is stored in cleartext (i.e., unencrypted), attackers could potentially read it. Even if the information is encoded in a way that is not human-readable, certain techniques could determine which encoding is being used, then decode the information.


When organizations adopt cloud services, it can be easier for attackers to access the data from anywhere on the Internet.


In some systems/environments such as cloud, the use of "double encryption" (at both the software and hardware layer) might be required, and the developer might be solely responsible for both layers, instead of shared responsibility with the administrator of the broader system/environment.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-311
ChildOf -> CWE-311
ChildOf -> CWE-922

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Terminology]** Different people use "cleartext" and "plaintext" to mean the same thing: the lack of encryption. However, within cryptography, these have more precise meanings. Plaintext is the information just before it is fed into a cryptographic algorithm, including already-encrypted text. Cleartext is any information that is unencrypted, although it might be in an encoded form that is not easily human-readable (such as base64 encoding).



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-30275:** Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) uses a driver that relies on a password stored in plaintext.
- **CVE-2009-2272:** password and username stored in cleartext in a cookie
- **CVE-2009-1466:** password stored in cleartext in a file with insecure permissions




## CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials

- **CVE-2022-35411:** Python-based RPC framework enables pickle functionality by default, allowing clients to unpickle untrusted data.




## CWE-287: Improper Authentication
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
When an actor claims to have a given identity, the product does not prove or insufficiently proves that the claim is correct.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
authentification: An alternate term is "authentification", which appears to be most commonly used by people from non-English-speaking countries.
AuthN: "AuthN" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authentication" within the web application security community. It is also distinct from "AuthZ," which is an abbreviation of "authorization." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.
AuthC: "AuthC" is used as an abbreviation of "authentication," but it appears to used less frequently than "AuthN."

### Relationships

### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This can be resultant from SQL injection vulnerabilities and other issues.

**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.

## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.

### Extended Description


Attackers may be able to bypass weak authentication faster and/or with less effort than expected.


### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-287

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-30034:** Chain: Web UI for a Python RPC framework does not use regex anchors to validate user login emails (CWE-777), potentially allowing bypass of OAuth (CWE-1390).

- **CVE-2021-3116:** Chain: Python-based HTTP Proxy server uses the wrong boolean operators (CWE-480) causing an incorrect comparison (CWE-697) that identifies an authN failure if all three conditions are met instead of only one, allowing bypass of the proxy authentication (CWE-1390)




## CWE-291: Reliance on IP Address for Authentication
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses an IP address for authentication.

### Extended Description
IP addresses can be easily spoofed. Attackers can forge the source IP address of the packets they send, but response packets will return to the forged IP address. To see the response packets, the attacker has to sniff the traffic between the victim machine and the forged IP address. In order to accomplish the required sniffing, attackers typically attempt to locate themselves on the same subnet as the victim machine. Attackers may be able to circumvent this requirement by using source routing, but source routing is disabled across much of the Internet today. In summary, IP address verification can be a useful part of an authentication scheme, but it should not be the single factor required for authentication.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-290
ChildOf -> CWE-923
ChildOf -> CWE-471

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-30319:** S-bus functionality in a home automation product performs access control using an IP allowlist, which can be bypassed by a forged IP address.




## CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
According to WASC, "Insufficient Session Expiration is when a web site permits an attacker to reuse old session credentials or session IDs for authorization."

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-672
ChildOf -> CWE-672
CanPrecede -> CWE-287

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Other]** The lack of proper session expiration may improve the likely success of certain attacks. For example, an attacker may intercept a session ID, possibly via a network sniffer or Cross-site Scripting attack. Although short session expiration times do not help if a stolen token is immediately used, they will protect against ongoing replaying of the session ID. In another scenario, a user might access a web site from a shared computer (such as at a library, Internet cafe, or open work environment). Insufficient Session Expiration could allow an attacker to use the browser's back button to access web pages previously accessed by the victim.






## CWE-307: Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts

- **CVE-2022-29952:** Condition Monitor firmware uses a protocol that does not require authentication.




## CWE-285: Improper Authorization
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.

### Extended Description


Assuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.


When access control checks are not applied consistently - or not at all - users are able to access data or perform actions that they should not be allowed to perform. This can lead to a wide range of problems, including information exposures, denial of service, and arbitrary code execution.


### Alternative Terms
AuthZ: "AuthZ" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authorization" within the web application security community. It is distinct from "AuthN" (or, sometimes, "AuthC") which is an abbreviation of "authentication." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-284
ChildOf -> CWE-284

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-285 is high-level and lower-level CWEs can frequently be used instead. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
**Comments:** Look at CWE-285's children and consider mapping to CWEs such as CWE-862: Missing Authorization, CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization, CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource, or others.
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction
**Suggested Alternatives:**
- CWE-862: Missing Authorization
- CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization
- CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource



### Observed Examples
