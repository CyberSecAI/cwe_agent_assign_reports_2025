  "query": "A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, was found in GNU Binutils 2.43. Affected is the function bfd_elf_reloc_symbol_deleted_p of the file bfd/elflink.c of the component ld. The manipulation leads to memory corruption. It is possible to launch the attack remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitability is told to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The patch is identified as b425859021d17adf62f06fb904797cf8642986ad. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue.",
