The provided evidence indicates that a **privileged user** with **network access** can cause an **information disclosure**. The best match is **CWE-200 - Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor**. While CWE-200 is a class level CWE and discouraged, the vulnerability description lacks specific root cause details.\n\nThe retriever results suggested various CWEs, but most of them relate to specific root causes that are not mentioned in the vulnerability description.
