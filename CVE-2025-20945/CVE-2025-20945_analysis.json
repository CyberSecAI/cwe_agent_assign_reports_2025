The vulnerability description indicates a problem with access control, but it does not specify whether the issue is related to authentication (e.g., missing or insufficient authentication) or authorization (e.g., incorrect permission checks). Since the description uses the general term \"**Improper access control**,\" CWE-284 is the most fitting, albeit high-level, choice. The CWE guidance states that this is to be used when the root cause is unclear.\n\nOther CWEs were considered but ultimately not chosen because they were either too specific or did not align with the available information. For instance, CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) and CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) were considered but discarded because the description does not explicitly mention issues related to authentication or authorization mechanisms. Similarly, CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) was not selected because there is no mention of missing authentication.\n\nThe decision to use CWE-284 is based on the direct evidence from the vulnerability description, which explicitly mentions \"**Improper access control**\". The confidence level is moderate (0.7) due to the lack of detailed information, which prevents a more precise classification.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n- **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* \u2013 top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear. This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.",
