## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-9298

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability. This occurs because the application uses direct object references (ticket IDs) in the URL without proper authorization checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The application directly uses ticket IDs in the URL parameter (`ids`) to access tickets. This allows an attacker to manipulate this parameter to access tickets belonging to other users.
- **Broken Access Control:** Due to the IDOR vulnerability, there is a lack of proper access control, allowing unauthorized users to view and download tickets that don't belong to them.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Ticket Access:** An attacker can view and download tickets of any user by simply manipulating the `ids` parameter in the URL.
- **Privacy Violation:** This could lead to exposure of personal information contained in the tickets such as passenger names, travel dates, and other booking details.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct URL Manipulation:** An attacker can directly modify the `ids` parameter in the URL (e.g., `http://localhost/orrs/?page=tickets&ids=123`) to view and download tickets associated with different ticket IDs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Knowledge of the application's URL structure:** The attacker needs to know the structure of the URL, specifically that the application uses an `ids` parameter to access ticket information.
- **Basic web browsing skills:** The attacker only needs the ability to manipulate the URL within a web browser.
- **No authentication or login is required to exploit this vulnerability.** An unauthenticated user can exploit this vulnerability.

**Affected Product and Version:**
- **Product:** Online Railway Reservation System
- **Vendor:** Sourcecodester
- **Version:** 1.0
- **Affected Endpoint:** `http://localhost/orrs/?page=tickets&ids=*`

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was found in the Sourcecodester Online Railway Reservation System and reported on Github.
