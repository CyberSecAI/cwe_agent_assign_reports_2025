    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'improper input validation'

Relevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:

### 1. CWE-20: Improper Input Validation (Score: 224.75)

The product receives input or data, but it does
        not validate or incorrectly validates that the input has the
        properties that are required to process the data safely and
        correctly....

### 2. CWE-784: Reliance on Cookies without Validation and Integrity Checking in a Security Decision (Score: 206.47)

The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of a cookie, but it does not properly ensure that the cookie is valid for the associated user....

### 3. CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input (Score: 203.89)

The product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties....

### 4. CWE-1286: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input (Score: 188.28)

The product receives input that is expected to be well-formed - i.e., to comply with a certain syntax - but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input complies with the syntax....

### 5. CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') (Score: 184.29)

The product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component....
