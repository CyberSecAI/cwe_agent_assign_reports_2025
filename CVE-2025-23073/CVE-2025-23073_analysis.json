  "reference_content": "## CVE-2025-23073 Analysis\n\nThis content is **RELATED** to CVE-2025-23073. It provides detailed information about the vulnerability, its resolution, and related code changes.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability occurs because the `action=query&list=globalblocks` API endpoint, when provided with both a username and IP address in the `bgtargets` parameter, reveals information about both the global block on the username *and* the associated autoblock on the IP address.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Information disclosure: The API unintentionally exposes the IP address associated with a global block, which could be considered sensitive information.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   Exposure of user IP addresses: An attacker who knows a username and correctly guesses the associated IP address can discover the IP address that was autoblocked.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   API request: An attacker can send a crafted API request to the `action=query&list=globalblocks` endpoint with the `bgtargets` parameter set to `<username>|<user's ip>`.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   Knowledge of a username.\n*   Ability to guess the user's IP address (e.g., by observing the user's edits on a wiki).\n*   Ability to make API requests to the MediaWiki instance.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   The API was modified to hide autoblocks when the `bgtargets` parameter includes both a username and an IP address.\n*   Two Gerrit commits were merged to address the issue:\n    *   [https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/1082231](https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/1082231)\n    *   [https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/1084748](https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/1084748)\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   The vulnerability was not present in any release version of MediaWiki.\n*   The issue was initially found on local docker GlobalBlocking builds and beta wikis.\n*   The CVE description was initially incorrect and has been updated.\n*   The fix has been deployed and the issue is no longer reproducible.\n*   The risk rating was assessed as Medium.\n*   The task was assigned to Dreamy\\_Jazz and authored by dom\\_walden.",

While CWE-200 is a broader class, CWE-201 more specifically describes the vulnerability as sensitive information being inserted into sent data (API response). There are also peer relationships between CWE-201 and other CWEs like CWE-202 (Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Data Queries) that were considered but deemed less relevant. The abstraction level of Base for CWE-201 was also preferred over the Class level of CWE-200, providing a more accurate representation of the weakness.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe202[\"CWE-202: Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Data Queries\"]\n\n    cwe201 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe201 --|CANALSOBE| cwe202\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe201 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n    class cwe202 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **incorrect implementation** of the API endpoint, leading to the **insertion of sensitive information (IP address)** into the API response, ultimately resulting in the **exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized actor**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is heavily based on the provided evidence from the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\", which states: \"The vulnerability occurs because the `action=query&list=globalblocks` API endpoint, when provided with both a username and IP address in the `bgtargets` parameter, reveals information about both the global block on the username *and* the associated autoblock on the IP address.\" This clearly points to **sensitive information being included in the sent data (API response)**.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the selection by highlighting the connection between the specific issue (CWE-201) and the broader impact (CWE-200).\n\nCWE-201 is chosen because it describes the root cause more accurately. It's about the *insertion* of sensitive information into the data being sent, rather than just the general *exposure*. This aligns with the API endpoint's behavior of including the IP address in its response. The provided evidence and the desire for specificity justify the choice of CWE-201 as the primary CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
