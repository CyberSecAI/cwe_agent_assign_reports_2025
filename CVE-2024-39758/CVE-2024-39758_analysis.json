The key phrase \"**Improper access control**\" strongly suggests an access control issue. The Retriever Results listed CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) as a relevant CWE. However, the CWE Classification Guidance emphasizes that when the issue is specifically related to authorization, CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) is preferred over the more general CWE-284.\n\nThe CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the **root cause** is \"**Improper access control**.\" This evidence, combined with the CWE Classification Guidance, supports the selection of CWE-285 as the primary CWE.\n\nThe graph relationships further support this decision, as CWE-285 is a child of CWE-284, indicating a more specific form of access control issue. CWE-285 is at the optimal level of specificity because the evidence clearly points to an authorization problem.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n*   CWE-285: Improper Authorization\n    *   The product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n    *   Usage: Discouraged - CWE-285 is high-level and lower-level CWEs can frequently be used instead. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).\n    *   The vulnerability description states: \"**Improper access control** for some Intel(R) Arc & Iris(R) Xe graphics software...may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable denial of service via local access.\"\n\nCWEs considered but not used:\n\n*   CWE-284 (Improper Access Control): This CWE was considered but not selected as the primary CWE because the CWE Classification Guidance suggests using more specific child CWEs when the access control issue is related to authorization. While CWE-284 is a relevant and broader category, CWE-285 more accurately reflects the specific nature of the vulnerability.\n*   CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function): This CWE was considered but not selected because the vulnerability description indicates that the user is authenticated, ruling out a missing authentication issue.\n*   CWE-862 (Missing Authorization): This CWE was considered, but the description states that authorization is performed incorrectly, which maps more directly to CWE-285 (Improper Authorization)\n*   CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization): This CWE was considered but is more appropriate when there is a flawed logic.
