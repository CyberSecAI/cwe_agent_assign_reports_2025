The issue occurs due to a **time-of-check/time-of-use condition** in hfsc_change_class() when working with certain child qdiscs like netem or codel. The vulnerability works as follows 1. hfsc_change_class() checks if a class has packets (q.qlen != 0) 2. It then calls qdisc_peek_len(), which for certain qdiscs (e.g., codel, netem) might drop packets and empty the queue 3. The code continues assuming the queue is still non-empty, adding the class to vttree 4. This breaks HFSC scheduler assumptions that only non-empty classes are in vttree 5. Later, when the class is destroyed, this can lead to a **Use-After-Free** The fix adds a second queue length check after qdisc_peek_len() to verify the queue wasnt emptied.', key_phrases={'rootcause': ['time-of-check/time-of-use condition', 'Use-After-Free vulnerability'], 'weakness': 'Use-After-Free', 'impact': '', 'vector': '', 'attacker': '', 'product': 'Linux kernel', 'version': '', 'component': 'net_sched hfsc'}, reference_content=None, similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {}, 'top_cwes_by_threshold': {}}}, similarity_summary=SimilarityInsight(consensus_cwe='', top_cwes=[], confidence_levels={}, total_samples=0), analysis='', analysis_with_relationships='', criticism='', resolution='', relevant_cwes=[{'metadata': {'doc_id': '367', 'name': 'Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': \"The product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check.

    "enhanced_query": "# Vulnerability Description\n\n    In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved net_sched hfsc Fix a UAF vulnerability in class handling This patch fixes a ****Use-After-Free** vulnerability** in the HFSC qdisc class handling. The issue occurs due to a **time-of-check/time-of-use condition** in hfsc_change_class() when working with certain child qdiscs like netem or codel. The vulnerability works as follows 1. hfsc_change_class() checks if a class has packets (q.qlen != 0) 2. It then calls qdisc_peek_len(), which for certain qdiscs (e.g., codel, netem) might drop packets and empty the queue 3. The code continues assuming the queue is still non-empty, adding the class to vttree 4. This breaks HFSC scheduler assumptions that only non-empty classes are in vttree 5. Later, when the class is destroyed, this can lead to a **Use-After-Free** The fix adds a second queue length check after qdisc_peek_len() to verify the queue wasnt emptied.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'time-of-check/time-of-use condition'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1.
