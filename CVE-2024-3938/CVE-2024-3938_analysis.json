This could potentially be used for phishing attacks by displaying malicious content or links, or for defacement of the login page. The CVSS score indicates low impact to confidentiality and integrity, and no impact to availability.\n- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based (AV:N), requiring no special access privileges (PR:N), and user interaction (UI:R) is needed to trigger the vulnerability.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to craft a URL containing the malicious HTML code in the `resetEmail` parameter and induce a victim to click on it. This could be done by sending a crafted link in an email.",

The reset password login page accepted an **HTML injection** via URL parameters, which aligns with the description of CWE-79. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-79, which is a Base level CWE. There are no direct parent or child relationships impacting this decision, but the retriever results and the vulnerability description both strongly support this classification. The focus is on **improper neutralization** leading to **HTML injection**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe79 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Improper neutralization** of input in the `resetEmail` parameter.\n2.  **Weakness:** **HTML injection**.\n3.  **Impact:** Potential for phishing attacks or defacement of the login page.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is primarily based on the provided evidence, which clearly indicates an **HTML injection** vulnerability due to **improper neutralization** of input. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" explicitly mentions \"HTML Injection\" and the root cause as the \"reset password\" login page accepting HTML injection via URL parameters. The retriever results also strongly suggest CWE-79 as the most appropriate classification.\n\nThe selection of CWE-79 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **improper neutralization** of input leading to **cross-site scripting** (in the form of HTML injection). Other CWEs, such as CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')), are more general and less precise.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**:

controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and

dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-96: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Statically Saved Code ('Static Code Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or

attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-93: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses CRLF (carriage return line feeds) as a special element, e.g. to separate lines or records, but it
