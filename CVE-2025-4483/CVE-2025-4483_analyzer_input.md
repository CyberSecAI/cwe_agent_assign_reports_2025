## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The content relates to CVE-2025-4483. Here's the extracted information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

* A SQL injection vulnerability was found in the '/view\_pdetails.php?id=12' file of the 'Gym Management System' project. The reason for this issue is that attackers inject malicious code from the parameter 'id' and use it directly in SQL queries without the need for appropriate cleaning or validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

* SQL injection

**Impact of exploitation:**

* Attackers can exploit this SQL injection vulnerability to achieve unauthorized database access, sensitive data leakage, data tampering, comprehensive system control, and even service interruption.

**Attack vectors:**

* The '/view\_pdetails.php?id=12' file is vulnerable. The 'id' parameter is the entry point for the attack.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

* No login or authorization is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Mitigation or fix:**

1.  **Use prepared statements and parameter binding:** Preparing statements can prevent SQL injection as they separate SQL code from user input data.
2.  **Input validation and filtering:** Strictly validate and filter user input data to ensure it conforms to the expected format.
3.  **Minimize database user permissions:** Ensure that the account used to connect to the database has the minimum necessary permissions.
4.  **Regular security audits:** Regularly conduct code and system security audits to promptly identify and fix potential security vulnerabilities.

**Payload examples (from the content):**

*   `id=10 AND 4006=4006` (boolean-based blind)
*   `id=10 OR (SELECT 1100 FROM(SELECT COUNT(*),CONCAT(0x71627a7171,(SELECT (ELT(1100=1100,1))),0x716a6a7a71,FLOOR(RAND(0)*2))x FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PLUGINS GROUP BY x)a)` (error-based)
*   `id=10 AND (SELECT 6941 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))mVyk)` (time-based blind)
*   `id=-1505 UNION ALL SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,CONCAT(0x71627a7171,0x546a6e76664f6f50577372627a686171576d4a664367464c51736a4d5962467769554d5171434b4d,0x716a6a7a71),NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL-- -` (UNION query)

**Affected and/or fixed version(s):**
