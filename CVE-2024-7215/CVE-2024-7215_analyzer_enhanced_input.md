## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability was found in TOTOLINK LR1200 9.3.1cu.2832 and classified as critical. Affected by this issue is the function NTPSyncWithHost of the file /cgi-bin/cstecgi.cgi. The manipulation of the argument host_time leads to **command injection**. The attack may be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. VDB-272786 is the identifier assigned to this vulnerability. NOTE The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **command injection**
- **product:** TOTOLINK LR1200
- **version:** 9.3.1cu.2832
- **component:** NTPSyncWithHost in /cgi-bin/cstecgi.cgi

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a command injection flaw within the `NTPSyncWithHost` function of the TOTOLINK LR1200 router's firmware. Specifically, the `host_time` parameter from a POST request is directly used in a system call without proper sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Command Injection: The primary weakness is the lack of input sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary commands through the `host_time` parameter.
- Unvalidated Input: The router software does not validate the content of the `host_time` parameter before using it in a system call.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Command Execution: A successful exploit allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the router's operating system with the privileges of the running process.
- Full System Compromise: This can lead to complete control of the device, allowing the attacker to potentially eavesdrop on network traffic, modify configurations, or use the device as part of a botnet.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST Request: The attack vector is a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/cgi-bin/cstecgi.cgi` endpoint, specifically targeting the `NTPSyncWithHost` function.
- Malicious `host_time` Parameter: The attacker includes malicious commands within the `host_time` parameter of the POST request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs network access to the router, either via the local network or, if exposed, through the internet.
- Knowledge of the Vulnerable Endpoint: The attacker needs to know the vulnerable URL (`/cgi-bin/cstecgi.cgi`) and the `NTPSyncWithHost` function.
- Ability to Send HTTP POST Requests: The attacker requires the ability to send HTTP POST requests with the required parameters.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in the TOTOLINK LR1200 router firmware version V9.3.1cu.2832.
- The provided POC demonstrates how to inject the command `ls -al ../` using the `host_time` parameter.
