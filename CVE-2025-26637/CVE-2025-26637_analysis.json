While CWE-1263 is related due to the physical attack vector, it is a secondary consideration. CWE-693 is a Pillar, which is a high-level abstraction.

The attack vector is a physical attack.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE selection is based on the direct match between the vulnerability description and CWE-693. The evidence is the phrase \"**Protection mechanism failure**\". The relationship analysis indicates that CWE-693 is a high-level Pillar, and more specific CWEs could be applicable if more details were provided. The retriever results support this selection, with CWE-693 being the top result.\n\nCWE-693 is at a high level of abstraction, but the provided information is insufficient to identify a more specific CWE.
