  "query": "A vulnerability classified as problematic has been found in Open Asset Import Library Assimp 5.4.3. This affects the function MDLImporterInternReadFile_3DGS_MDL345 of the file assimp/code/AssetLib/MDL/MDLLoader.cpp. The manipulation leads to out-of-bounds read. Local access is required to approach this attack. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The project decided to collect all Fuzzer bugs in a main-issue to address them in the future.",
