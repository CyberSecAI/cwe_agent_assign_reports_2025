## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability has been found in 1000 Projects Bookstore Management System 1.0 and classified as critical. This vulnerability affects unknown code of the file book_detail.php. The manipulation of the argument id leads to **sql injection**. The attack can be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **sql injection**
- **product:** 1000 Projects Bookstore Management System
- **version:** 1
- **component:** book_detail.php

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a SQL injection in the `book_detail.php` file of the Bookstore Management System PHP MySQL Project V1.0.
- The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization or validation of the `id` parameter before it's used in SQL queries. This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user input in the `id` parameter used in SQL queries.
- The vulnerability can be exploited using boolean-based blind, time-based blind, and UNION query injection techniques.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthorized database access.
- Sensitive data leakage.
- Data tampering (modification or deletion).
- Comprehensive system control.
- Potential service interruption.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The `id` parameter in the `book_detail.php` file is the attack vector. It is a GET parameter and is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be logged in or authorized.
- The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP GET requests to `book_detail.php` with malicious `id` parameter values.
- The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable application.

**Additional Information:**
- The report includes proof-of-concept (POC) payloads for different types of SQL injection: boolean-based blind, time-based blind, and UNION query.
- The report also shows SQLMap outputs demonstrating the exploitation of the vulnerability to obtain database information, table names, column names, and the admin username and password.
- The report suggests repairs such as using prepared statements with parameter binding, input validation and filtering, minimizing database user permissions and regular security audits.
