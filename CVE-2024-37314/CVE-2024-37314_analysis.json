  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n\n*   The vulnerability stems from a missing permission check when removing a photo from a shared album. Specifically, users who have access to a shared album (including via public link) could remove photos from it, even if they were not the owner/creator of the album or the photos.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n\n*   **Missing Authorization Check:** The primary weakness is the absence of a proper authorization check before allowing a user to remove a photo from an album. This means that any user with access to the album could delete photos.\n*   **Inadequate Access Control:** The system doesn't properly enforce access control policies related to modifying album content (removing photos), especially for publicly shared albums.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Data Integrity Loss:** Attackers could remove photos from a shared album, resulting in the loss of the data (photos) for other users expecting the photos to be available in the album.\n*   **Potential for Data Manipulation:** While not stated, repeated removal of photos could be used to disrupt shared resources or to harass other users.\n*   **Availability Impact:** Removal of photos affects the availability of content within the shared albums for legitimate users.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Network (Remote):** The attack can be carried out remotely over the network, as it involves interaction with a web application.\n*   **Publicly Shared Album Access:** The vulnerability is present when a photo album is shared using a public link, which gives anyone access to the album without authentication.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Low Privileges:** The attacker only needs an account on the Nextcloud server or the public link to the photo album to exploit the issue\n*   **User Interaction (Required):** User interaction is needed, presumably, the attacker needs to interact with the web interface to remove photos.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n*   The vulnerability was found by user \"juliusknorr\".\n*   The issue was addressed in versions 25.0.7 and 26.0.2.\n*   The fix was implemented by removing the ability for users to remove photos from public albums.\n*   The issue was initially found on public albums, which were intended to be read-only, but included the ability to delete photos.\n*   The provided CVSS score is: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L. This indicates a network-based attack (AV:N) with low complexity (AC:L), requiring low privileges (PR:L), user interaction (UI:R), and a scope unchanged (S:U). The impact is low (A:L), with no impact to confidentiality and integrity.\n\nThe content includes a reference to the pull request that fixed this issue. This pull request indicates that initially, a half-baked feature of public album editing was implemented, which lacked proper access controls.",
