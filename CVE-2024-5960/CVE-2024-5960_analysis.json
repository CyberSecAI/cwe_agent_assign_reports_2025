Matches the root cause directly. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-256, which is a Base level CWE. While it has a parent CWE (CWE-522 Insufficiently Protected Credentials), CWE-256 is a more specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability. There are no chain relationships relevant in this case.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe256[\"CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    \n    cwe256 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe256 primary\n    class cwe522 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward:\n1.  **Root Cause:** CWE-256 - Plaintext Storage of a Password\n2.  **Impact:** Use of Known Domain Credentials (as stated in the description)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states \"**plaintext storage of password**\". The retriever results also list CWE-256 as the top candidate.\n\nCWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password) is the most appropriate CWE because it directly addresses the **root cause** of the vulnerability. The description explicitly mentions the storage of passwords in plaintext, which aligns perfectly with the definition of CWE-256. The vulnerability's impact, \"Use of Known Domain Credentials\", is a direct consequence of this **plaintext storage**.\n\nOther CWEs were considered, especially those related to credential protection. However, they were not as precise as CWE-256:\n\n*   CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information): This is a broader category. While it applies, CWE-256 is more specific to passwords.\n*   CWE-916 (Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort): This applies to weak hashing, not plaintext storage.\n*   CWE-257 (Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format): This is about reversible encryption, not plaintext.\n*   CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials): This is a higher-level class.\nRelevant CWE Information:",
