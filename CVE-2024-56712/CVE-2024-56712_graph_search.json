This leaves a dma_buf in memory that contains a dangling pointer though that doesnt seem to lead to anything bad except a memory leak. Fix it by moving the dma_buf_fd() call out of export_udmabuf() so that we can give it different error handling. Note that the shape of this code changed a lot in commit 5e72b2b41a21 (udmabuf convert udmabuf driver to use folios) but the memory leak seems to have existed since the introduction of udmabuf.
