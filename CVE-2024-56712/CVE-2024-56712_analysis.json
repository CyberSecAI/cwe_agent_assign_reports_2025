  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved udmabuf fix **memory leak** on last export_udmabuf() error path In export_udmabuf(), if dma_buf_fd() fails because the FD table is full, a dma_buf owning the udmabuf has already been created but the error handling in udmabuf_create() will tear down the udmabuf without doing anything about the containing dma_buf. This leaves a dma_buf in memory that contains a dangling pointer though that doesnt seem to lead to anything bad except a **memory leak**. Fix it by moving the dma_buf_fd() call out of export_udmabuf() so that we can give it different error handling. Note that the shape of this code changed a lot in commit 5e72b2b41a21 (udmabuf convert udmabuf driver to use folios) but the **memory leak** seems to have existed since the introduction of udmabuf.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n- The vulnerability is a memory leak in the `udmabuf` driver.\n- The issue occurs within the `export_udmabuf()` function where a `dma_buf` is created, but if the subsequent `dma_buf_fd()` call fails (e.g., due to a full FD table), the `dma_buf` is not properly cleaned up, leading to a memory leak.\n- The error handling in `udmabuf_create()` only cleans up the `udmabuf` struct without deallocating the underlying `dma_buf`.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Memory Leak:** A `dma_buf` is allocated but not freed when `dma_buf_fd()` fails.\n- **Dangling Pointer:** The leaked `dma_buf` contains a dangling pointer, although this is not directly exploited in this scenario, it could potentially lead to issues if the memory is reused improperly.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Resource Exhaustion:** Repeatedly triggering the vulnerable code path can lead to memory exhaustion, potentially impacting the system's stability and performance, and ultimately leading to a denial-of-service.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **FD Table Exhaustion:** The vulnerability can be triggered by attempting to create a `udmabuf` when the FD table is full.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- The attacker needs to be able to create `udmabuf` instances. This requires a specific user with the permissions to interact with the `udmabuf` driver.\n- The attacker needs to have the ability to manipulate the system to cause FD table exhaustion or some other scenario where `dma_buf_fd()` fails.\n- The attacker can be a local user with enough privileges or another user that can manipulate the system.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n- The fix involves moving the `dma_buf_fd()` call outside of `export_udmabuf()` to ensure proper error handling and freeing of the underlying `dma_buf`.\n- This memory leak has been present since the introduction of the `udmabuf` driver.",

CWE-401 is at the Variant level, providing sufficient specificity. The other CWEs considered were either too general (Class level) or did not precisely match the described **memory leak** issue.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe401[\"CWE-401: Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe401 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward:\n1.  A `dma_buf` is allocated.\n2.  Due to an error condition (e.g., FD table full), the `dma_buf_fd()` call fails.\n3.  The error handling in `udmabuf_create()` only cleans up the `udmabuf` struct, but not the `dma_buf`.\n4.  Result: **Memory Leak** due to the `dma_buf` not being released.\n\nCWE-401 directly addresses the root cause of the **memory leak**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the **memory leak** as the core vulnerability. The Retriever Results strongly supported CWE-401 as the best candidate.\n\nEvidence:\n- \"udmabuf fix **memory leak**\"\n- \"This leaves a dma_buf in memory that contains a dangling pointer though that doesnt seem to lead to anything bad except a **memory leak**.\"\n- \"The issue occurs within the `export_udmabuf()` function where a `dma_buf` is created, but if the subsequent `dma_buf_fd()` call fails (e.g., due to a full FD table), the `dma_buf` is not properly cleaned up, leading to a **memory leak**.\"\n\nCWE-401's description aligns perfectly with the vulnerability: \"The product does not sufficiently track and release allocated memory after it has been used, which slowly consumes remaining memory.\"\n\nThe selection of CWE-401 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly describes the **missing** release of memory, which is the root cause of the vulnerability.\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this

would be more appropriate\n\n*Not used because:* This vulnerability is not related to concurrency or race conditions.\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which

writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-119 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available.\n\n*Not used because:* This vulnerability is about a **missing** *release* of memory, not an improper restriction of operations within a memory buffer.\n\n## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 1042.29\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale:",
