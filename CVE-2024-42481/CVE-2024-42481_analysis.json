This is directly related to the **lack of rate limiting** described in the vulnerability. CWE-400 is a parent Class of CWE-770, representing the broader issue of uncontrolled resource consumption. While CWE-400 is relevant, CWE-770 provides a more specific description of the **root cause**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    \n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe770 primary\n    class cwe400 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the **lack of rate limiting** on the `createFolder` and `createFile` functions. This leads to excessive resource allocation (CWE-770), ultimately resulting in 100% CPU usage and an OOM condition, which is a form of uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400) and can crash the system.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states a **lack of rate limiting** as the **root cause**, leading to excessive resource allocation and system instability.\n\nThe evidence from the vulnerability description key phrases includes:\n- **rootcause:** **lack of rate limiting**\n- **impact:** 100% CPU usage and an OOM\n- **vector:** making thousands of folders & files\n\nCWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) directly addresses the **root cause** of the vulnerability, which is the **lack of rate limiting** leading to uncontrolled resource allocation. CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) describes the impact of the vulnerability, but CWE-770 is more specific to the **root cause**.\n\nCWE-799 (Improper Control of Interaction Frequency) was also considered as a Class that might be relevant, but it is less specific than CWE-770. CWE-307 (Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts) is related to authentication, which is not directly mentioned in the vulnerability description. CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input) is not relevant, as the vulnerability is not related to validating input quantities but rather to the **lack of rate limiting**.\n\nBased on the evidence and the relationships between the CWEs, CWE-770 is the most appropriate primary CWE for this vulnerability, with CWE-400 as a secondary candidate representing the impact.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not check or incorrectly checks for unusual or exceptional conditions that are not expected to occur frequently during day to day operation of the product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-799: Improper Control of Interaction Frequency\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly limit the number or frequency of interactions that it has with an actor, such as the number of incoming requests.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).

It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
