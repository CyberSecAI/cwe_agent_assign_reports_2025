This includes creating files, executing shell commands, and potentially gaining a reverse shell.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- Network: The vulnerability is accessible via HTTP requests to the `/cov/triggerUnitCover` endpoint.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint. No authentication is mentioned as required to exploit the vulnerability, thus the attacker may be unauthenticated.\n- The attacker needs to craft a malicious payload containing the injected commands in the `uuid` parameter.",
