### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **command injection**
- **impact:** os command injection
- **product:** didi Super-Jacoco
- **version:** 1
- **component:** /cov/triggerUnitCover

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content is related to CVE-2024-10919.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The `triggerUnitCover` interface allows command injection via the `uuid` parameter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Command Injection: The application does not properly sanitize or validate the `uuid` parameter before using it in a command execution context, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary commands.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote Command Execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the target system with the privileges of the application. This includes creating files, executing shell commands, and potentially gaining a reverse shell.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network: The vulnerability is accessible via HTTP requests to the `/cov/triggerUnitCover` endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint. No authentication is mentioned as required to exploit the vulnerability, thus the attacker may be unauthenticated.
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious payload containing the injected commands in the `uuid` parameter.
