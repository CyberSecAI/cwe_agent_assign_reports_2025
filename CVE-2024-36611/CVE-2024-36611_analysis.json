CWE-287 is a parent of CWE-306, representing a more general class of improper authentication vulnerabilities. CWE-863, while related to authorization, is considered due to the potential for misconfigured authorization after a failed authentication attempt.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe306 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe863\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe306 primary\n    class cwe287,cwe863 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **missing authentication** check when the username or password field is empty (CWE-306). This **root cause** could then potentially lead to **improper authentication** (CWE-287) and possibly **incorrect authorization** (CWE-863) if the system proceeds with an unauthenticated or improperly authenticated user. The ultimate impact is potential denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on the **improper authentication logic handling** as the key phrase. However, after considering the detailed analysis provided in the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, it becomes clear that the **root cause** is the failure to handle empty username or password fields, which constitutes a **missing authentication** check. Therefore, CWE-306 is the more accurate primary CWE. The retriever results also support the selection of CWE-306, with a high similarity score. The relationship analysis highlights the hierarchical connection between CWE-306 and CWE-287, further solidifying the choice of CWE-306 as the primary weakness. The classification is based on the evidence that the system does not properly authenticate when presented with empty credentials, leading to potential bypass.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*This CWE was not selected because the issue isn't with the algorithm itself, but with the handling of empty input fields.*\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*This CWE was not selected because the problem is that there is missing authentication.
