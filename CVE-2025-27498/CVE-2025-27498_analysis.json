  "description": "aes-gcm is a pure Rust implementation of the AES-GCM. In decrypt_in_place_detached, the decrypted ciphertext (which is the correct ciphertext) is exposed even if the tag is incorrect. This is because in decrypt_inplace in asconcore.rs, tag verification causes an error to be returned with the plaintext contents still in buffer. The vulnerability is fixed in 0.4.3.",

Verification:**\n\nThe content directly relates to CVE-2025-27498 as it explicitly states the CVE ID and provides a detailed security advisory for the vulnerability.\n\n**2. Extracted Information:**\n\n* **Root cause of vulnerability:**\n  The vulnerability stems from the `decrypt_in_place_detached` function in `asconcore.rs` exposing the decrypted ciphertext even when the tag verification fails. This is similar to a previously identified vulnerability (GHSA-423w-p2w9-r7vq).\n\n* **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n  - Improper handling of tag verification failure in decryption.\n  - Exposure of plaintext data even on authentication failure.\n  - CWE-347: Improper Authentication.\n\n* **Impact of exploitation:**\n  - Unauthenticated plaintext exposure.\n  - Potential for chosen ciphertext attacks (CCAs).\n\n* **Attack vectors:**\n  - An attacker can provide an invalid tag during decryption.\n  - The attacker can then read the decrypted plaintext, even though authentication failed.\n\n* **Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n  - Local access to the system.\n  - Ability to provide a crafted input with an incorrect tag.\n  - Active user interaction is required.\n\n* **Mitigation or fix:**\n  - Upgrade to version 0.4.3 or later of the `ascon_aead` crate.\n  - The fix involves zeroizing the buffer during decryption on a failed tag check (as seen in the commit d1d749b).\n\n* **CVSS Score:**\n  - CVSS v4: 5.6/10\n  - Attack Vector: Local\n  - Attack Complexity: High\n  - Attack Requirements: None\n  - Privileges Required: None\n  - User interaction: Active\n  - Confidentiality: Low\n  - Integrity: High\n  - Availability: None\n\n**3. Additional Details:**\n\nThe content provides more detail than the official CVE description would likely contain, including:\n\n*   A proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrating the vulnerability.\n*   Specific file and line numbers related to the vulnerability.\n*   Detailed CVSS metrics.\n*   A link to the related commit that fixes the issue.\n*   A reference to a similar previous vulnerability (GHSA-423w-p2w9-r7vq).",

CWE-347 Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature is a Base CWE and a secondary candidate because the root cause is the plaintext contents are still in buffer even when the tag verification fails and exposure of plaintext data even on authentication failure. There aren't strong relationships to influence the selection.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe316[\"CWE-316: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in Memory\"]\n    cwe347[\"CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature\"]\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe316 primary\n    class cwe347 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the **improper handling of tag verification failure** during decryption, leading to the decrypted ciphertext being exposed even when the tag is incorrect. This results in the **cleartext storage of sensitive information in memory** and ultimately exposes the plaintext data even on authentication failure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability and the resulting impact. The key evidence is that \"the decrypted ciphertext (which is the correct ciphertext) is exposed even if the tag is incorrect\" and \"tag verification causes an error to be returned with the plaintext contents still in buffer\". This indicates a problem with how the decrypted data is handled after the tag verification fails. The retriever results suggested multiple CWEs, but after reviewing the vulnerability description and the complete CWE specifications, CWE-316 Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in Memory was selected as the primary CWE because the decrypted ciphertext is exposed even if the tag is incorrect. CWE-347 Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature was considered as a secondary CWE because it is related to tag verification failure in decryption. However, the primary issue is that the plaintext data is still present in the buffer after the verification fails, which is more accurately described by CWE-316.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n#
