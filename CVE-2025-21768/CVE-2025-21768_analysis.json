  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved net ipv6 fix **dst ref loops** in rpl, seg6 and ioam6 lwtunnels Some lwtunnels have a dst cache for post-transformation dst. If the packet destination did not change we may end up recording a reference to the lwtunnel in its own cache, and the lwtunnel state will never be freed. Discovered by the ioam6.sh test, kmemleak was recently fixed to catch per-cpu memory leaks. Im not sure if rpl and seg6 can actually hit this, but in principle I dont see why not.",

There is no strong evidence to suggest relationships with other CWEs based on the limited information provided.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe401[\"CWE-401: Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe401 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **dst ref loops**, which leads to a missing release of memory.\n  - **Root Cause:** **dst ref loops**\n  - **Weakness:** CWE-401 Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the limited information provided in the vulnerability description. The key phrase \"**dst ref loops**\" suggests a memory management issue where a destination reference is not properly released, leading to a memory leak. CWE-401 (Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime) is the most appropriate mapping because it directly addresses this scenario. The evidence is weak due to the limited context.
