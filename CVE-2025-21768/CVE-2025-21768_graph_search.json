If the packet destination did not change we may end up recording a reference to the lwtunnel in its own cache, and the lwtunnel state will never be freed. Discovered by the ioam6.sh test, kmemleak was recently fixed to catch per-cpu memory leaks. Im not sure if rpl and seg6 can actually hit this, but in principle I dont see why not. Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-201 CWE-191 CWE-401 CWE-476 CWE-923 CWE-362 CWE-909 CWE-835",
