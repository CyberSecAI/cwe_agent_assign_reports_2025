CWE-306 [CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function] is a child of CWE-287 [CWE-287: Improper Authentication], while CWE-200 [CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor] is a class-level CWE. The choice of CWE-306 [CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function] is preferred as it is more specific and at the Base level of abstraction, directly reflecting the **missing authentication** issue.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    \n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe306 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe306 primary\n    class cwe200,cwe287 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **missing authentication** for a critical function (CWE-306 [CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function]). This leads directly to the **exposure of sensitive information** (CWE-200 [CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor]) to an unauthenticated attacker. The root cause is clearly the lack of authentication.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary assessment is based on the vulnerability description indicating that an unauthenticated remote attacker can retrieve sensitive configuration information by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `getQuickCfgWifiAndLogin` function, **bypassing authentication checks**.\n\nThe key phrase \"bypassing authentication checks\" directly supports the selection of CWE-306 [CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function]. This is further supported by the guidance: \"If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** \u2192 CWE-306\".\n\nCWE-200 [CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor] is a secondary consideration as it describes the impact of the **missing authentication**, but it is less specific than CWE-306 [CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function], which represents the root cause.\n\nOther CWEs like CWE-425 [CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')] and CWE-862 [CWE-862: Missing Authorization] were considered but not selected because the vulnerability explicitly states that authentication checks are bypassed, making CWE-306 [CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function] the most accurate representation of the **root cause**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n**CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function**\nThe product does not perform any authentication for functionality that requires a provable user identity or consumes a significant amount of resources.\n\n**CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor**\nThe product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.",
