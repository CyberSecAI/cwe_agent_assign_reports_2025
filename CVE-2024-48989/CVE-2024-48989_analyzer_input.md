# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-48989

## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability in the PROFINET stack implementation of the IndraDrive (all versions) of Bosch Rexroth allows an attacker to cause a denial of service, rendering the device unresponsive by sending arbitrary UDP messages.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** denial of service
- **vector:** arbitrary UDP messages
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** Bosch Rexroth IndraDrive
- **version:** all versions
- **component:** PROFINET stack

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the PROFINET stack implementation of the Bosch Rexroth IndraDrive. Sending arbitrary UDP messages triggers the vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400):** The device becomes unresponsive due to excessive resource consumption caused by the processing of arbitrary UDP messages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial-of-service condition, rendering the IndraDrive device unresponsive. This can disrupt the normal operation of the system or machinery controlled by the device.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is performed over the network by sending UDP messages to the affected device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network connectivity to send UDP messages to the targeted IndraDrive device.
*   **No authentication required:** The vulnerability can be triggered without any prior authentication.
*   **Low Attack Complexity:** The attack can be executed with low complexity since it only requires sending arbitrary UDP messages to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Products:** Bosch Rexroth AG IndraDrive FWA-INDRV\*-MP\* with firmware versions 17VRS prior to 20V36.
*   **Solution:** Update to firmware version FWA-INDRV\*-MP\*-20V36 or later.
*   **Mitigation:**  Network segmentation and other measures described in the "Security Manual Electric Drives and Controls" can be used as a compensatory measure.
*   **Disclosure:** The vulnerability was responsibly disclosed by Roni Gavrilov from OTORIO.
*   The advisory provides a CVSS v3.1 score of 7.5 (High) with vector string `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H`
