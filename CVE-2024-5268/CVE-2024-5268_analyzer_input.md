# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-5268

# Vulnerability Description

    Sonos Era 100 SMB2 Message Handling Out-Of-Bounds Read **Information Disclosure Vulnerability**. This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Sonos Era 100 smart speakers. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the handling of SMB2 messages. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-22428.
