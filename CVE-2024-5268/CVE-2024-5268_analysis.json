  "description": "Sonos Era 100 SMB2 Message Handling Out-Of-Bounds Read **Information Disclosure Vulnerability**. This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Sonos Era 100 smart speakers. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the handling of SMB2 messages. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-22428.",

This results in an out-of-bounds read.\n- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists due to insufficient validation of user-supplied data in SMB2 message handling.\n- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can disclose sensitive information by reading past the end of an allocated buffer. This could potentially be chained with other vulnerabilities to achieve arbitrary code execution as root.\n- **Attack vectors:** A network-adjacent attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious SMB2 messages to the Sonos Era 100 smart speaker.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be network-adjacent to the affected Sonos Era 100 device. No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.",

The **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data** is the root cause and contributes to the vulnerability. Therefore, CWE-125 is the primary CWE, while CWE-20 could be a secondary contributing factor.
