# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-5268

## Description

Sonos Era 100 SMB2 Message Handling Out-Of-Bounds Read **Information Disclosure Vulnerability**. This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Sonos Era 100 smart speakers. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the handling of SMB2 messages. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-22428.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-125, which directly corresponds to the **out-of-bounds read** condition described in the vulnerability. CWE-20 is a broader category that encompasses many input validation issues, and while relevant, it is less specific than CWE-125. CWE-119 is also related as a parent of CWE-125 and encompasses memory buffer errors, but lacks the specificity of CWE-125 in this case.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data** (CWE-20), leading to an **out-of-bounds read** (CWE-125), which results in **information disclosure**.

## Summary of Analysis
The primary weakness is the **out-of-bounds read**, which directly leads to the **information disclosure**. The **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data** is the root cause and contributes to the vulnerability. Therefore, CWE-125 is the primary CWE, while CWE-20 could be a secondary contributing factor. The vulnerability description clearly states that the issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*This CWE is not selected because the root cause is **out-of-bounds read** and not just general exposure of sensitive information.*

## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate

*This CWE is not selected because the root cause is not related to data authenticity, but rather to buffer handling.*

## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*This CWE is not selected because it's more related to timing attacks and not directly applicable to the **out-of-bounds read**.*

## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

*This CWE is not selected because the vulnerability isn't related to weak credentials.*

## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*This CWE is not selected because the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data** doesn't relate to a specific security decision based on untrusted inputs.*

## CWE-134: Use of Externally-Controlled Format String
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a function that accepts a format string as an argument, but the format string originates from an external source.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*This CWE is not selected because there is no evidence that the vulnerability is caused by format string usage.*

## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*This CWE is not selected because the vulnerability isn't due to cleartext transmission.*

## CWE-657: Violation of Secure Design Principles
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product violates well-established principles for secure design.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate

*This CWE is not selected because it is too broad and lacks specificity.*

## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*This CWE is not selected because the vulnerability is not related to credentials.*

## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.

*This CWE is not selected because it's too broad and doesn't directly address the **out-of-bounds read**.*
