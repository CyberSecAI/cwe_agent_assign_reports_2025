## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2024-13212 (PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval) based on provided content:

The provided content details a vulnerability in the HouseRent application, specifically an arbitrary file upload vulnerability. This relates to a security issue where an attacker can upload malicious files to the server.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The `singleUpload` method in `src/main/java/com/house/wym/controller/AddHouseController.java` does not restrict the types of files that can be uploaded.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Unrestricted file upload: Lack of validation on uploaded file types.
*   Front-end only validation: Only front-end verification is performed on the file name.

**Impact of exploitation:**

Successful exploitation allows an attacker to upload arbitrary files, potentially including malicious scripts (e.g., HTML with JavaScript, JSP files). While JSP files can be uploaded, they are not directly accessible.  The uploaded files could lead to further attacks, such as cross-site scripting (XSS) or remote code execution (RCE) if the uploaded files are processed unsafely.

**Attack vectors:**

*   Directly accessing the upload endpoint: `http://192.168.0.102:8090/addHouse` (no login required).
*   Uploading a file with a malicious payload (e.g., a crafted HTML file containing JavaScript).
*   Changing the file extension to bypass basic checks.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   Network access to the vulnerable application.
*   Ability to craft a malicious file.
*   No authentication is required.

**Mitigation or fix:**

The content does not provide specific mitigation steps, but the root cause indicates that file type validation and sanitization should be implemented on the server-side to prevent the upload of unauthorized file types.

**Note:** This analysis is based solely on the provided content. The official CVE description (PLACEHOLDER) may contain additional details. The content provides more detail than the placeholder CVE description.
