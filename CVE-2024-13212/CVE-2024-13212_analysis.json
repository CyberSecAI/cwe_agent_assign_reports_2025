  "description": "A vulnerability classified as critical has been found in SingMR HouseRent 1.0. This affects the function singleUpload/upload of the file src/main/java/com/house/wym/controller/AddHouseController.java. The manipulation of the argument file leads to **unrestricted upload**. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.",

  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2024-13212 (PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval) based on provided content:\n\nThe provided content details a vulnerability in the HouseRent application, specifically an arbitrary file upload vulnerability. This relates to a security issue where an attacker can upload malicious files to the server.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe `singleUpload` method in `src/main/java/com/house/wym/controller/AddHouseController.java` does not restrict the types of files that can be uploaded.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Unrestricted file upload: Lack of validation on uploaded file types.\n*   Front-end only validation: Only front-end verification is performed on the file name.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nSuccessful exploitation allows an attacker to upload arbitrary files, potentially including malicious scripts (e.g., HTML with JavaScript, JSP files). While JSP files can be uploaded, they are not directly accessible.  The uploaded files could lead to further attacks, such as cross-site scripting (XSS) or remote code execution (RCE) if the uploaded files are processed unsafely.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Directly accessing the upload endpoint: `http://192.168.0.102:8090/addHouse` (no login required).\n*   Uploading a file with a malicious payload (e.g., a crafted HTML file containing JavaScript).\n*   Changing the file extension to bypass basic checks.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   Network access to the vulnerable application.\n*   Ability to craft a malicious file.\n*   No authentication is required.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\nThe content does not provide specific mitigation steps, but the root cause indicates that file type validation and sanitization should be implemented on the server-side to prevent the upload of unauthorized file types.\n\n**Note:** This analysis is based solely on the provided content. The official CVE description (PLACEHOLDER) may contain additional details. The content provides more detail than the placeholder CVE description.",

CWE-434 represents the **unrestricted upload** itself, while CWE-184 could describe the underlying reason for the **unrestricted upload**, which is an incomplete list of disallowed file types. CWE-73 (External Control of File Name or Path) can precede CWE-434 and may have played a role, but there is not enough information to know.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe434[\"CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\"]\n    cwe184[\"CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\"]\n    cwe73[\"CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\"]\n\n    cwe434\n    cwe184\n    cwe73 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe434\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe434 primary\n    class cwe184 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **unrestricted upload** due to a **missing** or **incomplete list of disallowed inputs**.\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** The `singleUpload` method in `src/main/java/com/house/wym/controller/AddHouseController.java` **does not restrict** the types of files that can be uploaded (CWE-434). It might stem from an **incomplete list of disallowed inputs** (CWE-184).\n2.  **Weakness:** **Unrestricted file upload** due to **lack of validation** on uploaded file types. Front-end only validation is performed on the file name.\n3.  **Impact:** Allows an attacker to upload arbitrary files, potentially including malicious scripts (e.g., HTML with JavaScript, JSP files). Could lead to further attacks, such as cross-site scripting (XSS) or remote code execution (RCE) if the uploaded files are processed unsafely.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe primary weakness is clearly an **unrestricted upload** of a file with a dangerous type (CWE-434). The description and the CVE reference summary strongly support this. The reference summary states that the `singleUpload` method does not restrict file types, which directly aligns with the definition of CWE-434. The secondary weakness could be the **incomplete list of disallowed inputs** (CWE-184) if that is indeed the reason why the upload is unrestricted.\n\n*   \"The `singleUpload` method in `src/main/java/com/house/wym/controller/AddHouseController.java` **does not restrict** the types of files that can be uploaded.\"\n\nCWE-434 is at the Base level of abstraction and is the most accurate representation of the vulnerability.

However, the primary issue is the **lack of restriction** on the file type itself, so I chose CWE-434 as the primary CWE.",
