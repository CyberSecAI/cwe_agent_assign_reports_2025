# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-47060

## Vulnerability Description
Zitadel is an open source identity management platform. In Zitadel, even after an organization is deactivated, associated projects, respectively their applications remain active. Users across other organizations can still log in and access through these applications, leading to unauthorized access. Additionally, if a project was deactivated access to applications was also still possible. The issue stems from the fact that when an organization is deactivated in Zitadel, the applications associated with it do not automatically deactivate. The application lifecycle is not tightly coupled with the organizations lifecycle, leading to a situation where the organization or project is marked as inactive, but its resources remain accessible. This vulnerability allows for unauthorized access to projects and their resources, which should have been restricted post-organization deactivation. Versions 2.62.1, 2.61.1, 2.60.2, 2.59.3, 2.58.5, 2.57.5, 2.56.6, 2.55.8, and 2.54.10 have been released which address this issue. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may explicitly disable the application to make sure the client is not allowed anymore.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** unauthorized access
- **product:** Zitadel
- **version:** 2.62.1, 2.61.1, 2.60.2, 2.59.3, 2.58.5, 2.57.5, 2.56.6, 2.55.8, and 2.54.10

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The core issue lies in the fact that ZITADEL does not automatically deactivate applications associated with a deactivated organization or project. The application lifecycle is not tightly coupled with the organization's or project's lifecycle. This results in a situation where an organization or project is marked as inactive, but the associated applications remain accessible.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insufficient Lifecycle Management:** The primary weakness is the lack of synchronization between the lifecycle of an organization/project and its associated applications. Deactivating an organization or project does not automatically disable the applications linked to it.
- **Unauthorized Access:** This leads to a situation where users from other organizations can still log in and gain access through the still-active applications associated with a deactivated organization or project.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unauthorized Access to Resources:** Attackers could gain unauthorized access to projects and their resources that should be restricted after the deactivation of the associated organization or project. This can lead to data breaches, unauthorized modification of resources, or other malicious activities.
- **Confidentiality and Integrity Compromise:**  The CVSS metrics indicate a High impact on both confidentiality and integrity, meaning that sensitive data could be accessed and potentially modified by unauthorized users.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, meaning an attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely.
- **Authentication Bypass:** The vulnerability allows bypassing the intended authentication restrictions by exploiting the active applications after organization or project deactivation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **No Privileges Required:**  The attacker does not require any specific privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
- **User Interaction Required:** The attacker requires some form of user interaction, which in the context of the provided Proof of Concept would be a user logging in.
- **Access to the Application:** The attacker needs access to an application associated with a deactivated organization or project and user authentication capabilities to that application.

**Additional Information:**

- **Proof of Concept:** The provided PoC details the steps to reproduce the vulnerability, which involves creating an organization, project, and OpenID Connect setup, then deactivating the organization and setting up authentication without checking for project on authentication. The user is able to login despite the organization is deactivated.
- **Patched Versions:** The provided document lists the patched versions of ZITADEL that address this vulnerability. These versions enforce the correct deactivation of applications when associated organizations or projects are deactivated.
- **Workaround:** A workaround for unpatched versions is to explicitly disable the application to prevent unauthorized access.
- **CVE ID:** This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE ID CVE-2024-47060
- **CVSS Score:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N, with a base score of 6.8, indicating a moderate severity.
