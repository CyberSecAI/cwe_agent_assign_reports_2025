  "query": "Zitadel is an open source identity management platform. In Zitadel, even after an organization is deactivated, associated projects, respectively their applications remain active. Users across other organizations can still log in and access through these applications, leading to unauthorized access. Additionally, if a project was deactivated access to applications was also still possible. The issue stems from the fact that when an organization is deactivated in Zitadel, the applications associated with it do not automatically deactivate. The application lifecycle is not tightly coupled with the organizations lifecycle, leading to a situation where the organization or project is marked as inactive, but its resources remain accessible. This vulnerability allows for unauthorized access to projects and their resources, which should have been restricted post-organization deactivation. Versions 2.62.1, 2.61.1, 2.60.2, 2.59.3, 2.58.5, 2.57.5, 2.56.6, 2.55.8, and 2.54.10 have been released which address this issue. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may explicitly disable the application to make sure the client is not allowed anymore.",
