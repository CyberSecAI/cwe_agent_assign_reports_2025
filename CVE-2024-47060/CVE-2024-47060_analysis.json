  "description": "Zitadel is an open source identity management platform. In Zitadel, even after an organization is deactivated, associated projects, respectively their applications remain active. Users across other organizations can still log in and access through these applications, leading to unauthorized access. Additionally, if a project was deactivated access to applications was also still possible. The issue stems from the fact that when an organization is deactivated in Zitadel, the applications associated with it do not automatically deactivate. The application lifecycle is not tightly coupled with the organizations lifecycle, leading to a situation where the organization or project is marked as inactive, but its resources remain accessible. This vulnerability allows for unauthorized access to projects and their resources, which should have been restricted post-organization deactivation. Versions 2.62.1, 2.61.1, 2.60.2, 2.59.3, 2.58.5, 2.57.5, 2.56.6, 2.55.8, and 2.54.10 have been released which address this issue. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may explicitly disable the application to make sure the client is not allowed anymore.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\n- The core issue lies in the fact that ZITADEL does not automatically deactivate applications associated with a deactivated organization or project. The application lifecycle is not tightly coupled with the organization's or project's lifecycle. This results in a situation where an organization or project is marked as inactive, but the associated applications remain accessible.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n- **Insufficient Lifecycle Management:** The primary weakness is the lack of synchronization between the lifecycle of an organization/project and its associated applications. Deactivating an organization or project does not automatically disable the applications linked to it.\n- **Unauthorized Access:** This leads to a situation where users from other organizations can still log in and gain access through the still-active applications associated with a deactivated organization or project.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n- **Unauthorized Access to Resources:** Attackers could gain unauthorized access to projects and their resources that should be restricted after the deactivation of the associated organization or project. This can lead to data breaches, unauthorized modification of resources, or other malicious activities.\n- **Confidentiality and Integrity Compromise:**  The CVSS metrics indicate a High impact on both confidentiality and integrity, meaning that sensitive data could be accessed and potentially modified by unauthorized users.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n- **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, meaning an attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely.\n- **Authentication Bypass:** The vulnerability allows bypassing the intended authentication restrictions by exploiting the active applications after organization or project deactivation.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n- **No Privileges Required:**  The attacker does not require any specific privileges to exploit the vulnerability.\n- **User Interaction Required:** The attacker requires some form of user interaction, which in the context of the provided Proof of Concept would be a user logging in.\n- **Access to the Application:** The attacker needs access to an application associated with a deactivated organization or project and user authentication capabilities to that application.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n- **Proof of Concept:** The provided PoC details the steps to reproduce the vulnerability, which involves creating an organization, project, and OpenID Connect setup, then deactivating the organization and setting up authentication without checking for project on authentication. The user is able to login despite the organization is deactivated.\n- **Patched Versions:** The provided document lists the patched versions of ZITADEL that address this vulnerability. These versions enforce the correct deactivation of applications when associated organizations or projects are deactivated.\n- **Workaround:** A workaround for unpatched versions is to explicitly disable the application to prevent unauthorized access.\n- **CVE ID:** This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE ID CVE-2024-47060\n- **CVSS Score:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N, with a base score of 6.8, indicating a moderate severity.",

CWE-863 was favored because it is a more specific form of authorization failure. The relationship between CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) and CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) was also considered, and I chose to include CWE-306 as a secondary CWE because the **missing** authentication is what led to the **incorrect** authorization. The class level of abstraction was chosen for CWE-863 as the description doesn't give the specific authorization implementation that is vulnerable.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe306 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe863\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe306 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **failure to deactivate applications** when an organization or project is deactivated (CWE-Other). This leads to **missing authentication** checks (CWE-306) on these applications, resulting in **incorrect authorization** (CWE-863) and ultimately unauthorized access to resources.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on authorization-related CWEs due to the **unauthorized access** impact. The retriever results highlighted CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) as a strong candidate, supported by the vulnerability description detailing how users could access resources they shouldn't have been able to. This is because the application lifecycle is not tightly coupled with the organizations lifecycle, leading to a situation where the organization or project is marked as inactive, but its resources remain accessible.\n\nThe analysis considered CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) as a secondary CWE because it represents the root cause that allows the **incorrect authorization** to occur. The **missing** authentication on the applications when an organization is deactivated leads to the **incorrect authorization**.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at an appropriate level of specificity. CWE-863 is a Class, indicating that the specific type of authorization error isn't detailed, and CWE-306 is a Base CWE, which accurately reflects the **missing** authentication check. The evidence supports these classifications, as the vulnerability description doesn't specify the exact authorization mechanism, only that it fails to prevent **unauthorized access**.\n\nRelevant CWE
