CWE-95 is considered as a secondary candidate because the **prototype pollution** can lead to code injection under certain circumstances. CWE-95 is a child of CWE-94 and represents a specific type of code injection. The Variant level of abstraction is chosen for both CWEs as it provides the most specific representation of the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1321[\"CWE-1321: Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')\"]\n    cwe95[\"CWE-95: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection')\"]\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n\n    cwe95 -->|CHILDOF| cwe94\n    cwe1321 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe95\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1321 primary\n    class cwe95 secondary\n    class cwe94 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')** (CWE-1321). This leads to the potential for **command injection**. In some cases, this could be achieved through **Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection')** (CWE-95).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is the **improperly controlled modification of object prototype attributes**, which is well-represented by CWE-1321. The vulnerability description and the CVE summary both highlight this aspect. The possibility of command injection suggests a potential secondary weakness related to code execution. The description mentions \"command injection\" as an impact. CWE-95 is included as a secondary candidate due to the possibility of dynamic code evaluation being involved, though the evidence for this is less direct. The retriever results also listed CWE-77, CWE-78 and CWE-94 which are command and code injection CWEs. However, these are consequences and not the root cause. The choice of CWE-1321 as primary is based on the root cause, while CWE-95 captures a potential impact scenario. This selection is made with high confidence due to clear evidence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1321: Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component that specifies attributes that are to be initialized or updated in an object, but it does not properly control modifications of attributes of the object prototype.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
