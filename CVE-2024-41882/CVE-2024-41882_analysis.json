  "description": "Team ENVY, a Security Research TEAM has found a flaw that allows for a remote code execution on the NVR. An attacker can cause a **stack overflow** by entering large data into URL parameters, which will result in a system reboot. The manufacturer has released patch firmware for the flaw, please refer to the manufacturers report for details and workarounds.",

Since the vulnerability specifically mentions a **stack overflow**, choosing the more specific CWE-121 is appropriate. CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input) can precede CWE-789 (Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value), which is a child of CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe121[\"CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    cwe1284[\"CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\"]\n    cwe789[\"CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n\n    cwe121 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe1284 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe789\n    cwe789 -->|CHILDOF| cwe770\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe121 primary\n    class cwe1284 secondary\n    class cwe119,cwe789,cwe770 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper handling of large data input** into URL parameters, leading to a **stack-based buffer overflow**, which results in remote code execution and a system reboot.\n\n*   Root Cause: **Stack overflow** caused by large data in URL parameters\n*   Weakness: CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\n*   Impact: Remote code execution and system reboot\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow) as the primary weakness due to the explicit mention of a **stack overflow** in the vulnerability description. The description states: \"An attacker can cause a **stack overflow** by entering large data into URL parameters, which will result in a system reboot.\" This directly aligns with the characteristics of CWE-121. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this by stating: \"Root cause of vulnerability: Stack-based buffer overflow due to large data input into URL parameters.\"\n\nCWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input) was considered because the vulnerability involves \"entering large data into URL parameters.\" The software **fails to properly validate the size of the input**, leading to the overflow. This is a contributing factor to the vulnerability, so it is mapped as a secondary CWE.\n\nOther CWEs were considered but deemed less relevant. CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) was considered but not chosen because the core issue is a buffer overflow, not an integer overflow. CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) was also considered, but the description focuses more on the **lack of validation of input size** rather than the unbounded allocation of resources.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-121 is a Variant-level CWE that directly describes the **stack overflow** condition. CWE-1284 is a Base-level CWE that describes the **improper validation of the input size**, which is the root cause of the overflow.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-294: Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA capture-replay flaw exists when the design of the product makes it possible for a malicious user to sniff network traffic and bypass authentication by replaying it to the server in question to the same effect as the original message (or with minor changes).\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA stack-based buffer overflow condition is a condition where the buffer being overwritten is allocated on the stack (i.e., is a local variable or, rarely, a parameter to a function).\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary.
