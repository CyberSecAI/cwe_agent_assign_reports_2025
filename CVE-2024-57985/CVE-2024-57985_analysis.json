  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved firmware qcom scm Cleanup global __scm on probe failures If SCM driver fails the probe, it should not leave global __scm variable assigned, because external users of this driver will assume the probe finished successfully. For example TZMEM parts (__scm->mempool) are initialized later in the probe, but users of it (__scm_smc_call()) rely on the __scm variable. This fixes theoretical **NULL pointer exception**, triggered via introducing probe deferral in SCM driver with call trace qcom_tzmem_alloc+0x70/0x1ac (P) qcom_tzmem_alloc+0x64/0x1ac (L) qcom_scm_assign_mem+0x78/0x194 qcom_rmtfs_mem_probe+0x2d4/0x38c platform_probe+0x68/0xc8",

CWE-476 **NULL Pointer Dereference** is a child of CWE-754 Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions, and CWE-755 Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions. However, CWE-476 is more specific and directly reflects the stated **NULL pointer exception**, making it the preferred choice. CWE-909 **Missing Initialization of Resource** can precede CWE-476, indicating a potential chain where a resource isn't initialized, leading to a **NULL pointer** and subsequent dereference. The abstraction levels also guided the selection, favoring the Base level (CWE-476) over the Class level (CWE-909) when the evidence clearly supports the more specific Base CWE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe476[\"CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference\"]\n    cwe909[\"CWE-909: Missing Initialization of Resource\"]\n    cwe754[\"CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions\"]\n    \n    cwe476 -->|CHILDOF| cwe754\n    cwe909 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe476\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe476 primary\n    class cwe909 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **missing initialization** (CWE-909) when the SCM driver fails to probe and doesn't clean up the global __scm variable. This leads to a state where external users assume successful initialization, but parts like `__scm->mempool` are not properly set up. Consequently, users relying on this uninitialized variable (e.g., `__scm_smc_call()`) trigger a **NULL pointer exception** (CWE-476) when they attempt to dereference the **NULL pointer**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is primarily based on the provided vulnerability description, which explicitly mentions a \"**NULL pointer exception**.\" The key phrase \"Cleanup global __scm on probe failures If SCM driver fails the probe, it should not leave global __scm variable assigned, because external users of this driver will assume the probe finished successfully\" supports the root cause.\n\nThe retriever results also strongly suggest CWE-476 **NULL Pointer Dereference** as the primary candidate. The graph relationships further support this, with CWE-476 being a child of broader categories related to improper checks and handling of exceptional conditions.\n\nCWE-909 **Missing Initialization of Resource** is considered a secondary CWE because the root cause of the NULL pointer dereference is that the `__scm` variable was not properly cleaned up after a probe failure, leading to an uninitialized state that later caused a **NULL pointer exception**.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-476 directly describes the **NULL pointer exception**, and CWE-909 describes the state of **missing initialization of the resource**, which is the root cause.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as
