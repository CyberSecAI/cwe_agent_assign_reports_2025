For example TZMEM parts (__scm->mempool) are initialized later in the probe, but users of it (__scm_smc_call()) rely on the __scm variable. This fixes theoretical NULL pointer exception, triggered via introducing probe deferral in SCM driver with call trace qcom_tzmem_alloc+0x70/0x1ac (P) qcom_tzmem_alloc+0x64/0x1ac (L) qcom_scm_assign_mem+0x78/0x194 qcom_rmtfs_mem_probe+0x2d4/0x38c platform_probe+0x68/0xc8",
