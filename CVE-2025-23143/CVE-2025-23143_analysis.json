  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved net Fix **null-ptr-deref** by sock_lock_init_class_and_name() and rmmod. When I ran the repro [0] and waited a few seconds, I observed two LOCKDEP splats a warning immediately followed by a **null-ptr-deref**. [1] Reproduction Steps 1) Mount CIFS 2) Add an iptables rule to drop incoming FIN packets for CIFS 3) Unmount CIFS 4) Unload the CIFS module 5) Remove the iptables rule At step 3), the CIFS module calls sock_release() for the underlying TCP socket, and it returns quickly. However, the socket remains in FIN_WAIT_1 because incoming FIN packets are dropped. At this point, the modules refcnt is 0 while the socket is still alive, so the following rmmod command succeeds. # ss -tan State Recv-Q Send-Q Local AddressPort Peer AddressPort FIN-WAIT-1 0 477 10.0.2.1551062 10.0.0.137445 # lsmod | grep cifs cifs 1159168 0 This highlights a discrepancy between the lifetime of the CIFS module and the underlying TCP socket. Even after CIFS calls sock_release() and it returns, the TCP socket does not die immediately in order to close the connection gracefully. While this is generally fine, it causes an issue with LOCKDEP because CIFS assigns a different lock class to the TCP sockets sk->sk_lock using sock_lock_init_class_and_name(). Once an incoming packet is processed for the socket or a timer fires, sk->sk_lock is acquired. Then, LOCKDEP checks the lock context in check_wait_context(), where hlock_class() is called to retrieve the lock class. However, since the module has already been unloaded, hlock_class() logs a warning and returns NULL, triggering the **null-ptr-deref**. If LOCKDEP is enabled, we must ensure that a module calling sock_lock_init_class_and_name() (CIFS, NFS, etc) cannot be unloaded while such a socket is still alive to prevent this issue. Lets hold the module reference in sock_lock_init_class_and_name() and release it when the socket is freed in sk_prot_free(). Note that sock_lock_init() clears sk->sk_owner for svc_create_socket() that calls sock_lock_init_class_and_name() for a listening socket, which clones a socket by sk_clone_lock() without GFP_ZERO.

The **Improper Locking (CWE-667)** is a secondary weakness, since the module is unloaded while the socket is still alive and the lock is still being acquired.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe476[\"CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference\"]\n    cwe667[\"CWE-667: Improper Locking\"]\n\n    cwe476 --o cwe667\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe476 primary\n    class cwe667 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the improper handling of the socket lifecycle, leading to a state where the CIFS module is unloaded while the associated TCP socket is still alive. This results in `hlock_class()` returning NULL when the socket lock is acquired, which then leads to the **NULL Pointer Dereference (CWE-476)**.\n- The unloading of the module while the socket is still alive creates a condition for improper locking and resource management.\n- When the socket attempts to acquire the lock, `hlock_class()` returns NULL because the module has been unloaded.\n- The code then attempts to dereference this NULL pointer, triggering a **NULL Pointer Dereference (CWE-476)**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe vulnerability is primarily a **NULL Pointer Dereference (CWE-476)**. The provided evidence clearly states that the `hlock_class()` function returns NULL, and the code then attempts to dereference this NULL pointer, leading to the crash. The fact that the module is unloaded while the socket is still alive contributes to this condition, making **Improper Locking (CWE-667)** a secondary weakness.\n\nThe key phrase \"**null-ptr-deref**\" directly supports the selection of CWE-476 as the primary weakness. The retriever results also list CWE-476 with a high similarity score, reinforcing this selection.\n\nThe relationship graph highlights the direct association between the **NULL Pointer Dereference (CWE-476)** and the **Improper Locking (CWE-667)**. The chain of events begins with the module being unloaded prematurely, resulting in a NULL pointer being dereferenced later on.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity.
