CWE-352 is a compound weakness, while CWE-79 is a base weakness. The relationship indicates that a successful CSRF attack can be used to inject malicious scripts, resulting in XSS.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n\n    cwe352 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe79\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe352 primary\n    class cwe79 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with CWE-352, Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), which allows an attacker to force a user to perform actions against the web application. This action can then lead to Stored XSS (CWE-79, Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation), where the injected script is stored on the server and executed by other users.\n\nCWE-352 (Root Cause) -> CWE-79 (Impact)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the vulnerability description and the CVE reference summary, which explicitly mention both Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) and Stored XSS. The Retriever Results also support these findings, with CWE-79 having the highest score and CWE-352 also being listed. The graph relationships indicate that CSRF can precede XSS.
