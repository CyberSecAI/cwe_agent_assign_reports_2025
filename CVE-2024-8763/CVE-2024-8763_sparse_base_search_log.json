An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the regular expression /{{(.*?)}}/g, causing the server to hang indefinitely and become unresponsive to any requests. This is due to the regular expressions susceptibility to second-degree polynomial time complexity, which can be triggered by a large number of braces in the input.",
