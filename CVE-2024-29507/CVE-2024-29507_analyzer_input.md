# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-29507

## Vulnerability Description
Artifex Ghostscript before 10.03.0 sometimes has a **stack-based buffer overflow** via the CIDFSubstPath and CIDFSubstFont parameters.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **stack-based buffer overflow**
- **product:** Artifex Ghostscript
- **version:** before 10.03.0
- **component:** CIDFSubstPath and CIDFSubstFont parameters

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-29507:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

-   The vulnerability lies within the handling of `cidfsubstpath` and `cidfsubstfont` parameters in the `pdfi_open_CIDFont_substitute_file` function. These parameters, controlled via PostScript objects, are used to load substitute fonts.
-   The code uses `memcpy` to copy the values of these parameters into a buffer `fontfname` without performing bounds checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Stack Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a stack buffer overflow. If the attacker-controlled `cidfsubstpath.data` or `cidfsubstfont.data` exceeds the size of the `fontfname` buffer (4096 bytes, `gp_file_name_sizeof`), a buffer overflow occurs on the stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Code Execution:** A stack buffer overflow can allow an attacker to overwrite data on the stack, potentially redirecting program execution and leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **PostScript Input:** The vulnerability is triggered through specially crafted PostScript input that defines the `cidfsubstpath` and/or `cidfsubstfont` parameters to exceed the buffer size.
-   **Indirect PDF Trigger**: The vulnerability is indirectly triggered through specially crafted PDFs processed by Ghostscript, which invoke the Postscript objects.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Control over Input:** The attacker needs to have control over the PostScript or PDF input that is processed by Ghostscript.
-   **No special command line flags required**: It does not require the use of special command-line flags for the exploit to work (besides the default -dSAFER), as the parameters are set within the document itself.
