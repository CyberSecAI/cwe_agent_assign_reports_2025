# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-42271
## Query
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved net/iucv fix use after free in iucv_sock_close() iucv_sever_path() is called from process context and from bh context. iucv->path is used as indicator whether somebody else is taking care of severing the path (or it is already removed / never existed). This needs to be done with atomic compare and swap, otherwise there is a small window where iucv_sock_close() will try to work with a path that has already been severed and freed by iucv_callback_connrej() called by iucv_tasklet_fn().
