While CWE-200 describes the general case of exposing sensitive information, CWE-538 specifies that the sensitive information is being placed into an externally accessible file or directory. The vulnerability description specifically mentions that \"JSON files are stored in predictable locations with guessable file names\", which strongly suggests CWE-538 is the better fit.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe538[\"CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe538 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe538 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **insertion of sensitive information** into a file, followed by the storage of that file in a predictable location. This leads to the **exposure of sensitive information** to unauthorized attackers. The root cause is the **improper placement of sensitive data into an externally accessible file or directory (CWE-538)**, leading to the impact of **sensitive information exposure (CWE-200)**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis considered multiple CWEs, with CWE-538 standing out due to the specific mention of \"JSON files are stored in predictable locations with guessable file names\". This directly aligns with the description of CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory.\n\nThe relationship analysis confirmed that CWE-538 is a more specific child of CWE-200, which makes it a better choice. While CWE-200 is a general exposure issue, CWE-538 pinpoints the root cause: the **insertion of sensitive information into a predictable, accessible file**.\n\nThe decision to use CWE-538 is based on the following evidence:\n\n-   \"JSON files are stored in predictable locations with guessable file names\" - Directly supports the \"externally accessible file or directory\" aspect of CWE-538.\n-   The **weakness** is **Sensitive Information Exposure**.\n\nOther CWEs like CWE-532 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File) and CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data) were considered but rejected because they don't accurately describe the vulnerability's mechanism. The data is not being logged or sent; it is being stored in a predictable location.\n\nCWE-200 was considered but ultimately categorized as a secondary impact rather than the primary root cause.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-538 directly describes the action that leads to the exposure, while CWE-200 describes the general consequence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive
