  "reference_content": "CVE-2025-29488: PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval\n\n**VULNERABILITIES:**\n\nThe content details multiple vulnerabilities found in libming version 0.4.8. These include:\n\n*   **Out-of-Memory Errors:** In `parseABC_NS_SET_INFO` and `parseABC_STRING_INFO` functions, large memory allocation attempts can lead to allocator exhaustion and potential Denial of Service (DoS).\n*   **Memory Leaks:** Identified in `parseSWF_ENABLEDEBUGGER2`, `parseSWF_PLACEOBJECT3`, `parseSWF_INITACTION`, and `parseSWF_MORPHFILLSTYLES` functions. Memory allocated for strings and other data is not always properly deallocated.\n*   **Segmentation Faults (SEGV):** Occur in `decompileRETURN`, `decompileCALLMETHOD`, `decompileGETPROPERTY`, `decompileGETMEMBER`, `decompileIMPLEMENTS`, and `decompileDUPLICATECLIP` functions due to invalid memory access (reading from the zero page).\n*   **Allocation-Size-Too-Big Error:** In `parseSWF_DEFINEBINARYDATA`, attempting to allocate an excessively large memory block exceeds the allocator's maximum supported size.\n\n**ROOT CAUSE:**\n\nThe root causes vary per vulnerability, but generally involve:\n\n*   **Insufficient Memory Management:** Failure to properly allocate and deallocate memory, leading to leaks and exhaustion.\n*   **Invalid Memory Access:** Dereferencing null or invalid memory pointers during decompilation processes.\n*   **Lack of Input Validation:**  Not properly validating the size of data being processed, leading to excessive allocation requests.\n\n**IMPACT:**\n\n*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Out-of-memory errors can crash the application or make it unresponsive.\n*   **Application Crash:** Segmentation faults lead to immediate application termination.\n*   **Resource Exhaustion:** Memory leaks can gradually consume system resources, impacting performance and stability.\n\n**ATTACK VECTORS:**\n\nThe vulnerabilities are triggered by processing specially crafted SWF files. An attacker could create a malicious SWF file designed to exploit these weaknesses.\n\n**ATTACKER CAPABILITIES/POSITION:**\n\nAn attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious SWF file to the target system for processing. This could be through a web server, email attachment, or other file-sharing mechanisms.\n\n**MITIGATION/FIX:**\n\nThe provided content does not include information about fixes or mitigations.\n\n**PoCs:**\n\nProof-of-concept (PoC) exploits are available at:\n\n*   [https://github.com/goodmow/PoC/blob/main/libming/poc1](https://github.com/goodmow/PoC/blob/main/libming/poc1)\n*   [https://github.com/goodmow/PoC/blob/main/libming/poc2](https://github.com/goodmow/PoC/blob/main/libming/poc2)\n*   [https://github.com/goodmow/PoC/blob/main/libming/poc3](https://github.com/goodmow/PoC/blob/main/libming/poc3)\n*   [https://github.com/goodmow/PoC/blob/main/libming/poc4](https://github.com/goodmow/PoC/blob/main/libming/poc4)\n*   [https://github.com/goodmow/PoC/blob/main/libming/poc5](https://github.com/goodmow/PoC/blob/main/libming/poc5)\n*   [https://github.com/goodmow/PoC/blob/main/libming/poc6](https://github.com/goodmow/PoC/blob/main/libming/poc6)\n*   [https://github.com/goodmow/PoC/blob/main/libming/poc7](https://github.com/goodmow/PoC/blob/main/libming/poc7)\n*   [https://github.com/goodmow/PoC/blob/main/libming/poc8](https://github.com/goodmow/PoC/blob/main/libming/poc8)\n*   [https://github.com/goodmow/PoC/blob/main/libming/poc9](https://github.com/goodmow/PoC/blob/main/libming/poc9)\n*   [https://github.com/goodmow/PoC/blob/main/libming/poc10](https://github.com/goodmow/PoC/blob/main/libming/poc10)\n*   [https://github.com/goodmow/PoC/blob/main/libming/poc11](https://github.com/goodmow/PoC/blob/main/libming/poc11)\n*   [https://github.com/goodmow/PoC/blob/main/libming/poc12](https://github.com/goodmow/PoC/blob/main/libming/poc12)\n*   [https://github.com/goodmow/PoC/blob/main/libming/poc13](https://github.com/goodmow/PoC/blob/main/libming/poc13)\n*   [https://github.com/goodmow/PoC/blob/main/libming/poc14](https://github.com/goodmow/PoC/blob/main/libming/poc14)\n*   [https://github.com/goodmow/PoC/blob/main/libming/poc15](https://github.com/goodmow/PoC/blob/main/libming/poc15)\n\nThe content provides significantly more detail than a typical CVE description, outlining multiple vulnerabilities with specific function names and ASAN reports.",

The vulnerability description states, \"libming v0.4.8 was discovered to contain a **memory leak** via the parseSWF_INITACTION function.\" The CVE reference links content summary further confirms this by stating, \"**Memory Leaks:** Identified in `parseSWF_ENABLEDEBUGGER2`, `parseSWF_PLACEOBJECT3`, `parseSWF_INITACTION`, and `parseSWF_MORPHFILLSTYLES` functions.
