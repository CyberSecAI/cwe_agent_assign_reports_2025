# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-49990

## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drm/xe/hdcp Check GSC structure validity Sometimes **xe_gsc is not initialized** when checked at HDCP capability check. Add gsc structure check to avoid null pointer error.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **xe_gsc is not initialized**
- **impact:** null pointer error
- **product:** Linux kernel
- **component:** drm/xe/hdcp Check GSC structure validity

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability arises from a missing check for the validity of the `xe_gsc` structure before accessing its members. Specifically, the code directly accesses `gt->uc.gsc` without verifying if `gt->uc.gsc` is initialized.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Null Pointer Dereference:**  If `xe_gsc` is not initialized (potentially due to a race condition or other initialization issues), the code attempts to dereference a null pointer leading to a crash or undefined behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Kernel Crash:** A null pointer dereference within the kernel can lead to a system crash (kernel panic), resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS).

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered within the `intel_hdcp_gsc_check_status` function, which is part of the Intel graphics driver (DRM/xe).
- Triggering this function in a scenario where `xe_gsc` isn't initialized would be the attack vector. The specific circumstances when the xe_gsc structure is uninitialized are not described. However, the commit messages point to a potential race condition during HDCP capability check which could lead to uninitialized structure and subsequent null pointer dereference.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need the capability to interact with the Intel graphics driver in a way that triggers the `intel_hdcp_gsc_check_status` function, while the `xe_gsc` structure is not properly initialized. This might be achieved by manipulating display settings, or triggering HDCP related functionality while some driver components are not ready.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix introduces a check to ensure the `gsc` pointer is valid before accessing its `fw` member and before calling `xe_gsc_proxy_init_done()`. This prevents the null pointer dereference.
- The provided diffs show that the fix involves adding the `!gsc` check. The original code used `!xe_uc_fw_is_enabled(&gt->uc.gsc.fw)` while the fixed code uses  `!gsc && !xe_uc_fw_is_enabled(&gsc->fw)`. And similarly for `xe_gsc_proxy_init_done` where it changed from  `!xe_gsc_proxy_init_done(&gt->uc.gsc)` to `!xe_gsc_proxy_init_done(gsc)`.
