While more specific Base or Variant level CWEs exist for different types of information exposure, the provided information lacks the specificity to choose a more granular CWE. Therefore, CWE-200, despite being discouraged, is the most appropriate choice given the available details. There is no identified chain relationship in the description.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    \n    class cwe200 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is relatively simple: **Exposure of sensitive information** leads to a compromise of system security. The provided information does not detail how the sensitive information is exposed, only that it occurs.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment pointed to CWE-200 due to the clear indication of **exposure of sensitive information**. While CWE-200 is discouraged, the lack of specific details about the type of exposure prevents the selection of a more granular CWE. The decision relies heavily on the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section, which explicitly states \"Exposure of sensitive information\" as the root cause and weakness.\n>   \"vulnerability_details\": {\n>     \"root_cause\": \"Exposure of sensitive information\",\n>     \"weaknesses\": [\n>       \"Exposure of sensitive information\"\n>     ]\nDespite the discouraged usage, CWE-200 accurately reflects the described vulnerability given the limited information. Other CWEs considered were rejected due to a lack of supporting evidence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*This was not selected because the vulnerability description is not specific to system-level information.*\n\n## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-200 is commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error.

It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*This was not selected because the description is not about external control of resources.*\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*This was not selected because the description is not about authentication algorithm implementation.*\n\n## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*This was not selected because the description is not related to uninitialized pointers.*\n\n## CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 553.11\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the product does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*This was not selected because the description is not related to path traversal.*\n\n## CWE",
