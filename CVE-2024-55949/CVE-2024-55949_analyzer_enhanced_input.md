### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** privilege escalation
- **product:** MinIO
- **component:** IAM import API

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-55949

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing permissions check in the IAM import API. This lack of validation allowed a user to modify their own policy mapping by crafting a malicious `iam-info.zip` file and uploading it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authorization Check:** The primary weakness is the absence of proper authorization checks when importing IAM data. This allowed a user to import an `iam-info.zip` file and effectively overwrite their existing permissions.
- **Privilege Escalation:** This vulnerability enabled a user with limited privileges to escalate their privileges to `consoleAdmin` or other higher-level policies.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** A user with basic permissions could gain administrative access, allowing them to perform actions that they were not authorized to do.
- **Data Breach/Manipulation:** An attacker might gain access to sensitive data, delete or alter data, or disrupt the service.
- **Compromise of the System:** By achieving administrative privileges, an attacker could take complete control of the MinIO instance.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Maliciously Crafted ZIP File:** An attacker would need to create a specially crafted `iam-info.zip` file that includes a modified `user_mappings.json` file to change their policy mappings.
- **`mc admin cluster iam import` API:** The attacker would use the `mc admin cluster iam import` command to upload the crafted ZIP file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Existing MinIO User:** The attacker needs to be a valid user on the MinIO system. Anonymous users are not able to perform this attack.
- **Access to `mc` client:** The attacker needs to have access to the `mc` (MinIO Client) command-line tool to be able to perform the import.
- **Network Access:**  The attacker must have network access to the MinIO server.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is present since the introduction of the IAM import API, specifically introduced by commit `580d9db85e04f1b63cc2909af50f0ed08afa965f` on June 23, 2022.
- The vulnerability is fixed in commit `f246c9053f9603e610d98439799bdd2a6b293427`, part of pull request #20756.
- The fix introduces an authorization check using `globalIAMSys.IsAllowed` before importing the IAM data.
- The vulnerable API endpoints are `/minio/admin/v2/import-iam` and `/minio/admin/v3/import-iam-v2`.

**Mitigation:**
- **Upgrade:** Upgrade MinIO to version `RELEASE.2024-12-13T22-19-12Z` or later.
- **Temporary Block API Calls:** If an immediate upgrade is not possible, temporarily block external access to the vulnerable API endpoints through a firewall or load balancer.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability is considered critical.
- Credit for reporting this issue is given to the National Security Agency.

The provided content gives a good level of technical details and provides clear steps to reproduce and fix the issue.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* 🔍 *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* 🔍 *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion – CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### 🔸 CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ✅ *“A user created with the ‘guest’ role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ✅ *“The backup service runs as root but only needs read access.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ⚠️ This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### 🔸 CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ✅ *“User can access another user’s invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.”*

## Mapping Examples – Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *“User can escalate privileges to admin.”*
> ❌ Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged – only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ✅ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**
