This could provide some information about the encryption key in use.\n*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker within RF range can capture the broadcasted message containing the encryption key name.\n*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be within RF communication range of the goTenna Pro devices during key sharing, specifically when the key is broadcasted.\n\nThe advisory recommends sharing the encryption key via local QR code for higher security operations to avoid the key name being broadcast in the clear.",
