The application **fails to disallow unsolicited invites**, indicating an authorization failure. |\n| CWE-923 | Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints | 0.6 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | The vulnerability involves a failure to properly restrict the communication channel, allowing a malicious remote user to send invites to local channels, making them shared without consent. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship impacting the decision is the hierarchical relationship. CWE-863 is a Class, and it has potential Base-level children that could be more specific. However, given the information available, CWE-863 provides a suitable level of abstraction. CWE-923 is also a Class, and it is related to the improper restriction of the communication channel, which leads to the unauthorized sharing of local channels.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe923[\"CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints\"]\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe923 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **failure to disallow unsolicited invites** (CWE-863). This leads to the exposure of local channels (impact). The fact that shared channels are enabled is a prerequisite for the vulnerability to be exploitable.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-863 as the primary weakness due to the **failure to disallow unsolicited invites**. This aligns with the definition of Incorrect Authorization. CWE-923 was considered as a secondary weakness because the communication channel was not properly restricted, leading to unauthorized access.\n\nThe evidence is based on the vulnerability description, specifically the phrase \"**fail to disallow unsolicited invites**\". This phrase directly indicates an authorization problem.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the selection by highlighting the relationship between authorization and the communication channel. While a more specific CWE might exist, the available information supports CWE-863 and CWE-923 as the most appropriate choices at this time.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-941: Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product creates a communication channel to initiate an outgoing request to an actor, but it does not correctly specify the intended destination for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-346: Origin Validation Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly verify that the source of data or communication is valid.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
