# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-39777

## Description

Mattermost versions 9.9.x <= 9.9.0, 9.5.x <= 9.5.6, 9.7.x <= 9.7.5 and 9.8.x <= 9.8.1 **fail to disallow unsolicited invites** to expose access to local channels, when shared channels are enabled, which allows a malicious remote to send an invite with the ID of an existing local channel, and that local channel will then become shared without the consent of the local admin.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Rootcause:** fail to disallow unsolicited invites

- **Vector:** shared channels are enabled
- **Attacker:** malicious remote
- **Product:** Mattermost
- **Version:** 9.9.x <= 9.9.0, 9.5.x <= 9.5.6, 9.7.x <= 9.7.5 and 9.8.x <= 9.8.1

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-863 | Incorrect Authorization | 0.75 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Primary CWE. The application **fails to disallow unsolicited invites**, indicating an authorization failure. |
| CWE-923 | Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints | 0.6 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | The vulnerability involves a failure to properly restrict the communication channel, allowing a malicious remote user to send invites to local channels, making them shared without consent. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship impacting the decision is the hierarchical relationship. CWE-863 is a Class, and it has potential Base-level children that could be more specific. However, given the information available, CWE-863 provides a suitable level of abstraction. CWE-923 is also a Class, and it is related to the improper restriction of the communication channel, which leads to the unauthorized sharing of local channels.

```

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **failure to disallow unsolicited invites** (CWE-863). This leads to the exposure of local channels (impact). The fact that shared channels are enabled is a prerequisite for the vulnerability to be exploitable.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis identified CWE-863 as the primary weakness due to the **failure to disallow unsolicited invites**. This aligns with the definition of Incorrect Authorization. CWE-923 was considered as a secondary weakness because the communication channel was not properly restricted, leading to unauthorized access.

The evidence is based on the vulnerability description, specifically the phrase "**fail to disallow unsolicited invites**". This phrase directly indicates an authorization problem.

The graph relationships influenced the selection by highlighting the relationship between authorization and the communication channel. While a more specific CWE might exist, the available information supports CWE-863 and CWE-923 as the most appropriate choices at this time.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-941: Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product creates a communication channel to initiate an outgoing request to an actor, but it does not correctly specify the intended destination for that actor.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-346: Origin Validation Error
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly verify that the source of data or communication is valid.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product establishes a communication channel to (or from) an endpoint for privileged or protected operations, but it does not properly ensure that it is communicating with the correct endpoint.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.

## CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web server receives a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 516.53
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
