The description also states that attackers can extract sensitive information from the database.\n\nThe retriever results list CWE-89 as the top candidate.\n\nThe evidence \"due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**\" strongly supports the selection of CWE-89. The description clearly indicates that the plugin fails to properly neutralize special elements in SQL commands, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL code.\n\nCWE-89 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability: the improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL command. Other CWEs, such as CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')), are more general and do not specifically address SQL injection.",
