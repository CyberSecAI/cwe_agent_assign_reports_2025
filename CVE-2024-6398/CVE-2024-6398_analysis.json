  "description": "An **information disclosure vulnerability** in SWG in versions 12.x prior to 12.2.10 and 11.x prior to 11.2.24 allows information stored in a customizable block page to be disclosed to third-party websites due to Same Origin Policy Bypass of browsers in certain scenarios. The risk is low, because other recommended default security policies such as URL categorization and GTI are in place in most policies to block access to uncategorized/high risk websites. Any information disclosed depends on how the customers have customized the block pages.",

While a more specific Base or Variant CWE would be ideal, the available information does not clearly point to a more granular weakness. CWE-923 relates to the improper restriction of communication channels, which aligns with the **Same Origin Policy bypass**. CWE-200 is a Class-level CWE that describes exposure of sensitive information, which is a consequence of the **Same Origin Policy bypass** in this vulnerability. It's considered secondary because it describes the impact rather than the root cause.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe923[\"CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe200 -- IMPACT --> cwe923\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe923 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper restriction of the communication channel**, specifically the **Same Origin Policy bypass** (CWE-923), which leads to the **exposure of sensitive information** (CWE-200). The chain is:\n\nCWE-923 (Root Cause: **Same Origin Policy bypass**) -> CWE-200 (Impact: **information disclosure**).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the vulnerability description, which highlights a **Same Origin Policy bypass** leading to **information disclosure**. The primary CWE, CWE-923, reflects the root cause of the vulnerability, where the communication channel is not properly restricted to the intended endpoints. The secondary CWE, CWE-200, indicates the resulting **exposure of sensitive information** to unauthorized actors.\n\nThe selection of CWE-923 is influenced by the description of the **Same Origin Policy bypass**, which is a mechanism for restricting communication channels between different origins. The retriever results also list CWE-923 with a reasonable score. Although CWE-923 is a Class-level CWE, there isn't enough information to determine a more specific Base or Variant CWE.\n\nCWE-200 is included as a secondary CWE because the vulnerability description mentions **information disclosure**, which aligns with the description of CWE-200. However, CWE-200 is a broad CWE and is often misused. In this case, it's used to represent the impact of the vulnerability, rather than the root cause.\n\nThe evidence for CWE-923 comes from the \"**rootcause: Same Origin Policy bypass**\" phrase in the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section. The evidence for CWE-200 comes from the \"**weakness: information disclosure vulnerability**\" phrase in the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section.\n\nOther CWEs Considered:\n\n*   CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data - While sensitive information is disclosed, the root cause is not necessarily the insertion of sensitive information, but rather the **Same Origin Policy bypass** that allows the disclosure.\n*   CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') - This is not directly related to the **Same Origin Policy bypass** described in the vulnerability.\n*   CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization - Authorization is not mentioned in the description.\n*   CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm - Cryptography is not mentioned in the description.\n*   CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs - There is no mention of a list of disallowed inputs.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-451: User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe user interface (UI) does not properly represent critical information to the user, allowing the information - or its source - to be obscured or spoofed.

It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.\n\n## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction,",
