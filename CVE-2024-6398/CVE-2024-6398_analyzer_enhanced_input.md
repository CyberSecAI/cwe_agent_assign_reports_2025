## Vulnerability Description
An **information disclosure vulnerability** in SWG in versions 12.x prior to 12.2.10 and 11.x prior to 11.2.24 allows information stored in a customizable block page to be disclosed to third-party websites due to Same Origin Policy Bypass of browsers in certain scenarios. The risk is low, because other recommended default security policies such as URL categorization and GTI are in place in most policies to block access to uncategorized/high risk websites. Any information disclosed depends on how the customers have customized the block pages.
