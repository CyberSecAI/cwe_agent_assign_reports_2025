  "description": "IrfanView DXF File Parsing **Memory Corruption** Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of IrfanView. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of DXF files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a memory corruption condition. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-24808.",

The target must open the malicious file or visit a malicious page that triggers the parsing of the malicious DXF file.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted DXF file. User interaction is required, as the target must either open the file or visit a malicious page to trigger the vulnerability.",

The root cause is the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary weakness is CWE-787, which is a Base level CWE and accurately describes the out-of-bounds write condition caused by the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**. CWE-20 is a Class level CWE and a parent of CWE-787, representing the broader category of improper input validation. The relationship shows that the more specific CWE-787 is a consequence of the more general CWE-20.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe20 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper input validation** (CWE-20) leading to an **out-of-bounds write** (CWE-787), which results in **memory corruption** and, ultimately, remote code execution.\n  - Root Cause: **Lack of proper validation of user-supplied data** (CWE-20)\n  - Weakness: **Out-of-bounds Write** (CWE-787)\n  - Impact: **Memory corruption**, Remote Code Execution\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, which clearly indicates a **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data** leading to memory corruption. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms that the root cause lies in the improper validation of user-supplied data, which results in a memory corruption condition. The primary CWE, CWE-787, is a direct consequence of this **lack of validation**.\n\nThe graph relationships support the selection of CWE-787 as the primary CWE, as it is a more specific child of CWE-20. The retriever results also indicate that CWE-787 is the most relevant CWE based on the vulnerability description.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, as CWE-787 accurately describes the out-of-bounds write condition, while CWE-20 represents the broader category of improper input validation that led to the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.67\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.67\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.67\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-129: Improper Validation of Array Index\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.67\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses untrusted input when calculating or using an array index, but the product does not validate or incorrectly validates the index to ensure the index references a valid position within the array.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.66\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary.
