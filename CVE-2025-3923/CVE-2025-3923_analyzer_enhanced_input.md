# Vulnerability Description

    The Prevent Direct Access Protect WordPress Files plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to **Sensitive Information Exposure** in all versions up to, and including, 2.8.8 via the **generate_unique_string** due to **insufficient randomness** of the generated file name. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to extract sensitive data including files protected by the plugin if the attacker can determine the file name.
