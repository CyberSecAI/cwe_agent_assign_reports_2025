The reason is due to sign-extension of 32-bit load for packet data/data_end/data_meta uapi field. The original code looks like r2 = *(s32 *)(r1 + 76) /* load __sk_buff->data */ r3 = *(u32 *)(r1 + 80) /* load __sk_buff->data_end */ r0 = r2 r0 += 8 if r3 > r0 goto +1 ... Note that __sk_buff->data load has 32-bit sign extension. After verification and convert_ctx_accesses(), the final asm code looks like r2 = *(u64 *)(r1 +208) r2 = (s32)r2 r3 = *(u64 *)(r1 +80) r0 = r2 r0 += 8 if r3 > r0 goto pc+1 ... Note that r2 = (s32)r2 may make the kernel __sk_buff->data address invalid which may cause runtime failure. Currently, in C code, typically we have void *data = (void *)(long)skb->data void *data_end = (void *)(long)skb->data_end ... and it will generate r2 = *(u64 *)(r1 +208) r3 = *(u64 *)(r1 +80) r0 = r2 r0 += 8 if r3 > r0 goto pc+1 If we allow sign-extension, void *data = (void *)(long)(int)skb->data void *data_end = (void *)(long)skb->data_end ... the generated code looks like r2 = *(u64 *)(r1 +208) r2 >= 32 r3 = *(u64 *)(r1 +80) r0 = r2 r0 += 8 if r3 > r0 goto pc+1 and this will cause verification failure since r2 data */ this patch added additional checking in is_valid_access() callback function for packet data/data_end/data_meta access.
