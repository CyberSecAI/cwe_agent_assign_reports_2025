## Vulnerability Description
The Eaton Foreseer software provides multiple customizable input fields for the users to configure parameters in the tool like alarms, reports, etc. Some of these input fields were **not checking the length and bounds of the entered value**. The exploit of this security flaw by a bad actor may result in excessive memory consumption or **integer overflow**.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **not checking the length and bounds of the entered value**
- **weakness:** **integer overflow**
- **impact:** excessive memory consumption or integer overflow
- **attacker:** bad actor
- **product:** Eaton Foreseer software

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described for CVE-2024-31416:

*   **Root Cause:** Improper validation of specified quantity in input fields within the Foreseer software.
*   **Weakness:** The software fails to check the length and bounds of user-provided input values.
*   **Impact:** This lack of validation can lead to excessive memory consumption or integer overflow, potentially causing instability or denial-of-service.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by providing specially crafted input to the Foreseer software.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to have high privileges on the local machine where the Foreseer application is running, with no user interaction required for the exploit.
