CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) is a Class-level CWE and represents a flaw in the authorization logic, which aligns with the \"logic error in the code\" described in the vulnerability. CWE-223 (Omission of Security-relevant Information) is considered a secondary factor, as hiding information from settings results in a local information disclosure. I considered CWE-862 (Missing Authorization), but the description suggests a logic error, not a complete absence of authorization.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe223[\"CWE-223: Omission of Security-relevant Information\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe223 -.->|RELATED_TO| cwe863\n    cwe862 -.->|PEEROF| cwe863\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe223 secondary\n    class cwe862 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with a **logic error in the code** (CWE-Unknown), leading to **Incorrect Authorization** (CWE-863), which results in a malicious app being able to hide an NLS from Settings. This then leads to **local information disclosure** (CWE-223).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the description points to a **logic error in the code**, which is a general statement. The key to determining the specific CWE is the impact: a malicious app hiding an NLS from Settings, leading to local information disclosure. I considered the retriever results that suggest several authorization and information exposure related CWEs.\n\nThe phrase \"**logic error in the code**\" suggests that there is authorization code, but that it has an error that allows a malicious app to hide an NLS from Settings. Therefore, CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) is the most appropriate primary CWE. The hiding of an NLS from settings is an **Omission of Security-relevant Information** (CWE-223).\n\nI am selecting CWE-863 because it aligns with the vulnerability description where a \"logic error\" resulted in incorrect authorization. The abstraction level of Class is appropriate because a more specific Base CWE isn't apparent from the provided information. The MITRE mapping guidance allows for the use of Class-level CWEs with review.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
