## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.

### Extended Description


A race condition occurs within concurrent environments, and it is effectively a property of a code sequence. Depending on the context, a code sequence may be in the form of a function call, a small number of instructions, a series of program invocations, etc.


A race condition violates these properties, which are closely related:


  - Exclusivity - the code sequence is given exclusive access to the shared resource, i.e., no other code sequence can modify properties of the shared resource before the original sequence has completed execution.

  - Atomicity - the code sequence is behaviorally atomic, i.e., no other thread or process can concurrently execute the same sequence of instructions (or a subset) against the same resource.

A race condition exists when an "interfering code sequence" can still access the shared resource, violating exclusivity.

The interfering code sequence could be "trusted" or "untrusted." A trusted interfering code sequence occurs within the product; it cannot be modified by the attacker, and it can only be invoked indirectly. An untrusted interfering code sequence can be authored directly by the attacker, and typically it is external to the vulnerable product.

CanPrecede -> CWE-416
CanPrecede -> CWE-476

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** The relationship between race conditions and synchronization problems (CWE-662) needs to be further developed. They are not necessarily two perspectives of the same core concept, since synchronization is only one technique for avoiding race conditions, and synchronization can be used for other purposes besides race condition prevention.

**[Research Gap]** Race conditions in web applications are under-studied and probably under-reported. However, in 2008 there has been growing interest in this area.

**[Research Gap]** Much of the focus of race condition research has been in Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) variants (CWE-367), but many race conditions are related to synchronization problems that do not necessarily require a time-of-check.

**[Research Gap]** From a classification/taxonomy perspective, the relationships between concurrency and program state need closer investigation and may be useful in organizing related issues.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-29527:** Go application for cloud management creates a world-writable sudoers file that allows local attackers to inject sudo rules and escalate privileges to root by winning a race condition.
- **CVE-2021-1782:** Chain: improper locking (CWE-667) leads to race condition (CWE-362), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2021-0920:** Chain: mobile platform race condition (CWE-362) leading to use-after-free (CWE-416), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.




## CWE-253: Incorrect Check of Function Return Value
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product incorrectly checks a return value from a function, which prevents it from detecting errors or exceptional conditions.

### Extended Description
Important and common functions will return some value about the success of its actions. This will alert the program whether or not to handle any errors caused by that function.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-573
ChildOf -> CWE-754

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2023-49286:** Chain: function in web caching proxy does not correctly check a return value (CWE-253) leading to a reachable assertion (CWE-617)




## CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product does not check or incorrectly checks for unusual or exceptional conditions that are not expected to occur frequently during day to day operation of the product.

### Extended Description


The programmer may assume that certain events or conditions will never occur or do not need to be worried about, such as low memory conditions, lack of access to resources due to restrictive permissions, or misbehaving clients or components. However, attackers may intentionally trigger these unusual conditions, thus violating the programmer's assumptions, possibly introducing instability, incorrect behavior, or a vulnerability.


Note that this entry is not exclusively about the use of exceptions and exception handling, which are mechanisms for both checking and handling unusual or unexpected conditions.


### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-703
CanPrecede -> CWE-416

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Sometimes, when a return value can be used to indicate an error, an unchecked return value is a code-layer instance of a missing application-layer check for exceptional conditions. However, return values are not always needed to communicate exceptional conditions. For example, expiration of resources, values passed by reference, asynchronously modified data, sockets, etc. may indicate exceptional conditions without the use of a return value.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2023-49286:** Chain: function in web caching proxy does not correctly check a return value (CWE-253) leading to a reachable assertion (CWE-617)
- **CVE-2007-3798:** Unchecked return value leads to resultant integer overflow and code execution.
- **CVE-2006-4447:** Program does not check return value when invoking functions to drop privileges, which could leave users with higher privileges than expected by forcing those functions to fail.




## CWE-617: Reachable Assertion
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product contains an assert() or similar statement that can be triggered by an attacker, which leads to an application exit or other behavior that is more severe than necessary.

### Extended Description


While assertion is good for catching logic errors and reducing the chances of reaching more serious vulnerability conditions, it can still lead to a denial of service.


For example, if a server handles multiple simultaneous connections, and an assert() occurs in one single connection that causes all other connections to be dropped, this is a reachable assertion that leads to a denial of service.


### Alternative Terms
assertion failure

- **CVE-2006-6767:** FTP server allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon abort) via crafted commands which trigger an assertion failure.
- **CVE-2006-6811:** Chat client allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a long message string when connecting to a server, which causes an assertion failure.




## CWE-667: Improper Locking
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.

### Extended Description


Locking is a type of synchronization behavior that ensures that multiple independently-operating processes or threads do not interfere with each other when accessing the same resource. All processes/threads are expected to follow the same steps for locking. If these steps are not followed precisely - or if no locking is done at all - then another process/thread could modify the shared resource in a way that is not visible or predictable to the original process. This can lead to data or memory corruption, denial of service, etc.


### Alternative Terms

**Reasons:**

### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** Deeper research is necessary for synchronization and related mechanisms, including locks, mutexes, semaphores, and other mechanisms. Multiple entries are dependent on this research, which includes relationships to concurrency, race conditions, reentrant functions, etc. CWE-662 and its children - including CWE-667, CWE-820, CWE-821, and others - may need to be modified significantly, along with their relationships.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-1782:** Chain: improper locking (CWE-667) leads to race condition (CWE-362), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2009-0935:** Attacker provides invalid address to a memory-reading function, causing a mutex to be unlocked twice
- **CVE-2010-4210:** function in OS kernel unlocks a mutex that was not previously locked, causing a panic or overwrite of arbitrary memory.




## CWE-1285: Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product receives input that is expected to specify an index, position, or offset into an indexable resource such as a buffer or file, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the specified index/position/offset has the required properties.

### Extended Description


Often, indexable resources such as memory buffers or files can be accessed using a specific position, index, or offset, such as an index for an array or a position for a file. When untrusted input is not properly validated before it is used as an index, attackers could access (or attempt to access) unauthorized portions of these resources. This could be used to cause buffer overflows, excessive resource allocation, or trigger unexpected failures. 


### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships

**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** This entry is still under development and will continue to see updates and content improvements.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2005-0369:** large ID in packet used as array index
- **CVE-2001-1009:** negative array index as argument to POP LIST command




## CWE-609: Double-Checked Locking
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses double-checked locking to access a resource without the overhead of explicit synchronization, but the locking is insufficient.

### Extended Description
Double-checked locking refers to the situation where a programmer checks to see if a resource has been initialized, grabs a lock, checks again to see if the resource has been initialized, and then performs the initialization if it has not occurred yet. This should not be done, as it is not guaranteed to work in all languages and on all architectures. In summary, other threads may not be operating inside the synchronous block and are not guaranteed to see the operations execute in the same order as they would appear inside the synchronous block.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-667
CanPrecede -> CWE-367

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use






## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check. This can cause the product to perform invalid actions when the resource is in an unexpected state.

### Extended Description
This weakness can be security-relevant when an attacker can influence the state of the resource between check and use. This can happen with shared resources such as files, memory, or even variables in multithreaded programs.

### Alternative Terms
TOCTTOU: The TOCTTOU acronym expands to "Time Of Check To Time Of Use".
TOCCTOU: The TOCCTOU acronym is most likely a typo of TOCTTOU, but it has been used in some influential documents, so the typo is repeated fairly frequently.

### Relationships

ChildOf -> CWE-362

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** TOCTOU issues do not always involve symlinks, and not every symlink issue is a TOCTOU problem.

**[Research Gap]** Non-symlink TOCTOU issues are not reported frequently, but they are likely to occur in code that attempts to be secure.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2015-1743:** TOCTOU in sandbox process allows installation of untrusted browser add-ons by replacing a file after it has been verified, but before it is executed
- **CVE-2003-0813:** A multi-threaded race condition allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash or reboot) by causing two threads to process the same RPC request, which causes one thread to use memory after it has been freed.
- **CVE-2004-0594:** PHP flaw allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by aborting execution before the initialization of key data structures is complete.




## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.

### Extended Description


Attackers may be able to bypass weak authentication faster and/or with less effort than expected.


### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-287

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-30034:** Chain: Web UI for a Python RPC framework does not use regex anchors to validate user login emails (CWE-777), potentially allowing bypass of OAuth (CWE-1390).
- **CVE-2022-35248:** Chat application skips validation when Central Authentication Service (CAS) is enabled, effectively removing the second factor from two-factor authentication
- **CVE-2021-3116:** Chain: Python-based HTTP Proxy server uses the wrong boolean operators (CWE-480) causing an incorrect comparison (CWE-697) that identifies an authN failure if all three conditions are met instead of only one, allowing bypass of the proxy authentication (CWE-1390)




## CWE-287: Improper Authentication
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
When an actor claims to have a given identity, the product does not prove or insufficiently proves that the claim is correct.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
authentification: An alternate term is "authentification", which appears to be most commonly used by people from non-English-speaking countries.
AuthN: "AuthN" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authentication" within the web application security community. It is also distinct from "AuthZ," which is an abbreviation of "authorization." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.
AuthC: "AuthC" is used as an abbreviation of "authentication," but it appears to used less frequently than "AuthN."

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-284
ChildOf -> CWE-284

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** This CWE entry might be misused when lower-level CWE entries are likely to be applicable. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
**Comments:** Consider children or descendants, beginning with CWE-1390: Weak Authentication or CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse
**Suggested Alternatives:**
- CWE-1390: Weak Authentication
- CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This can be resultant from SQL injection vulnerabilities and other issues.

**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-35248:** Chat application skips validation when Central Authentication Service (CAS) is enabled, effectively removing the second factor from two-factor authentication
- **CVE-2022-36436:** Python-based authentication proxy does not enforce password authentication during the initial handshake, allowing the client to bypass authentication by specifying a 'None' authentication type.
- **CVE-2022-30034:** Chain: Web UI for a Python RPC framework does not use regex anchors to validate user login emails (CWE-777), potentially allowing bypass of OAuth (CWE-1390).
