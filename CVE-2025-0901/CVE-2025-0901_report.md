# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2025-0901

## Description

PDF-XChange Editor Doc Object **Out-Of-Bounds Read** Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of PDF-XChange Editor. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the handling of Doc objects. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a **read past the end of an allocated buffer**. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-25372.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Rootcause:** lack of proper validation of user-supplied data
- **Weakness:** ['read past the end of an allocated buffer', 'Out-Of-Bounds Read']
- **Impact:** ['execute code in the context of the current process', 'execute arbitrary code', 'Remote Code Execution']
- **Attacker:** remote attackers
- **Product:** PDF-XChange Editor
- **Component:** Doc objects

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID  | CWE Name  | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-125 | Out-of-bounds Read | 1.0 | Base |  Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-20 | Improper Input Validation | 0.9 | Class | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.95
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship is that **CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read)** is often caused by **CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation)**. The product **lacks proper validation of user-supplied data** which leads to a **read past the end of an allocated buffer**.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation)**, where the product does not validate user-supplied data. This leads to **CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read)**, where the product reads data past the end of an allocated buffer. Finally, this can result in arbitrary code execution.

## Summary of Analysis
The vulnerability description clearly states that the issue is a "**Out-Of-Bounds Read**" due to the "**lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a **read past the end of an allocated buffer**".

The **ROOTCAUSE** is "**lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**" which maps to **CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation)**. The **WEAKNESS** is "**read past the end of an allocated buffer**", which directly maps to **CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read)**.

**CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read)** is the most specific CWE that describes the vulnerability, and it is at the Base level of abstraction, which is the preferred level. **CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation)** is included because it is the root cause of the vulnerability and explains why the out-of-bounds read occurred.

The retriever results also list **CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write)** as a potential candidate, but the vulnerability description explicitly mentions a read operation, not a write operation. Therefore, **CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write)** is not appropriate.

**CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer)** is too general and discouraged, as it's better to use lower-level CWEs when available.

Based on the evidence and the CWE specifications, the primary CWE is **CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read)**, and the secondary CWE is **CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation)**.
