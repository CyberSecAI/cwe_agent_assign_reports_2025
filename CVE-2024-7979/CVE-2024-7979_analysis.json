CWE-269 and CWE-250 are considered as secondary candidates because the vulnerability ultimately leads to privilege escalation, which involves improper privilege management. The relationship between CWE-59 and the privilege escalation impact is that the ability to manipulate file access can be leveraged to gain higher privileges. CWE-59 is a Base level CWE, providing a more specific description of the vulnerability compared to the Class level CWE-269.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe59[\"CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')\"]\n    cwe269[\"CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management\"]\n    cwe250[\"CWE-250: Execution with Unnecessary Privileges\"]\n    \n    cwe269 -->|CAUSES| cwe59\n    cwe250 -->|RELATED| cwe269\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe59 primary\n    class cwe269,cwe250 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **insufficient data validation** in the installer, which allows a local attacker to create a crafted symbolic link (CWE-59).

CWE-59 directly addresses the **improper handling of the symbolic link**, which is the core weakness exploited by the attacker. The vulnerability description mentions that a local attacker can perform privilege escalation via a crafted symbolic link, which aligns with the CWE-59 description.
