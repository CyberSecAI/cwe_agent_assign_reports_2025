The vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"heap memory corruption\" as a result of an \"off-by-one error\" in a size calculation. CWE-787 directly addresses the root cause of writing data past the intended buffer, leading to memory corruption.|\n| CWE-193 | Off-by-one Error | 0.8 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The vulnerability description highlights an **off-by-one error** in the size calculation. This error directly contributes to the out-of-bounds write. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship is that CWE-193 can lead to CWE-787. The **off-by-one error** (CWE-193) in the size calculation directly results in the **out-of-bounds write** (CWE-787). CWE-787 is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), indicating a broader class of memory safety issues.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe193[\"CWE-193: Off-by-one Error\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe193 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe787\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **CWE-193 (Off-by-one Error)**, which leads to **CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write)**, and ultimately results in **heap memory corruption** and the potential for code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on explicit statements in the vulnerability description and CVE summary. The description mentions an \"**off-by-one error** and resultant **heap memory corruption**\". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms \"Heap corruption in U-Boot\u2019s SquashFS directory listing function\" as a root cause.\n\nCWE-787 is chosen because it accurately reflects the **out-of-bounds write** that leads to **heap memory corruption**, and CWE-193 is chosen because it is the root cause of the **out-of-bounds write**.\n\nThe retriever results support this choice, with CWE-787 being the top result and CWE-193 being a high-ranking result.\n\nCWE-120 (Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input) was considered, but the description doesn't explicitly mention a buffer copy operation. The vulnerability stems from an **off-by-one error** in a size calculation, making CWE-193 and CWE-787 more appropriate.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-193: Off-by-one Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product calculates or uses an incorrect maximum or minimum value that is 1 more, or 1 less, than the correct value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1285: Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input that is expected to specify an index, position, or offset into an indexable resource such as a buffer or file, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the specified index/position/offset has the required properties.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
