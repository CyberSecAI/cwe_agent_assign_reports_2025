# Analysis Report for CVE-2025-2841

# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2025-2841

## Description

The Cart66 Cloud plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 2.3.7 through the publicly accessible phpinfo.php script. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to view potentially sensitive information contained in the exposed file.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Component:** publicly accessible phpinfo.php script
- **Weakness:** Sensitive Information Exposure, unprotected phpinfo.php script
- **Product:** Cart66 Cloud plugin for WordPress
- **Impact:** view potentially sensitive information
- **Attacker:** unauthenticated attackers
- **Version:** all versions up to and including 2.3.7

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-200 | Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor | 0.9 | Class | Primary | Allowed-with-Review |
| CWE-552 | Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties | 0.7 | Base | Secondary Candidate | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that influenced my decision was the parent-child relationship between CWE-538 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory) and CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor). CWE-538 is a child of CWE-200, providing a more specific classification. However, the description mentions the exposure of the `phpinfo.php` file, making CWE-552 (Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties) a relevant secondary consideration. I chose CWE-200 as the primary because the root cause is exposure of information, and the file being accessible is a contributing factor.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the inclusion of a `phpinfo.php` script in the Cart66 Cloud plugin, which is then made publicly accessible. This leads to the **exposure of sensitive information** to unauthenticated attackers.
  - Root Cause: Inclusion of `phpinfo.php` and lack of access control (CWE-200 and CWE-552)
  - Impact: Unauthorized access to sensitive information.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis focused on the **weakness of sensitive information exposure** through an **unprotected phpinfo.php script**. The retriever results pointed to CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) as the top candidate. While CWE-200 is a Class-level CWE and generally discouraged, in this case, it accurately represents the core issue. CWE-552 (Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties) is considered a secondary factor, as the root cause is information exposure rather than simple file accessibility.

The evidence from the vulnerability description includes: "The Cart66 Cloud plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to **Sensitive Information Exposure** in all versions up to, and including, 2.3.7 through the publicly accessible phpinfo.php script." This directly supports the selection of CWE-200. The phrase "publicly accessible phpinfo.php script" also supports the inclusion of CWE-552, although it's a contributing factor rather than the primary cause.

CWE-200 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the sensitive information exposure. While more specific CWEs exist (e.g., CWE-538), they don't fully capture the initial **exposure** aspect.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
**Abstraction Level**: Compound
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.

## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.
