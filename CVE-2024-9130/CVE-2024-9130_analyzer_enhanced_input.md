## Vulnerability Description
The GiveWP - Donation Plugin and Fundraising Platform plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to time-based SQL Injection via the order parameter in all versions up to, and including, 3.16.1 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with GiveWP Manager-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries within the Legacy View mode, that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.
