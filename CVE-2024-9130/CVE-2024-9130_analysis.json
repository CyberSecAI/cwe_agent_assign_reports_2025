This allows authenticated attackers to inject SQL queries and extract sensitive information from the database.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is CWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')). This is due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. The vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary clearly state this root cause. The retriever results also identify CWE-89 as the top candidate.\n\nThe evidence supporting this mapping is strong. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**, which directly relates to the core issue described in CWE-89. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this by stating \"Insufficient escaping on the user-supplied \u2018order\u2019 parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.\"\n\nOther CWEs were considered but ultimately not selected because they represent either broader categories or different aspects of the vulnerability. For example, CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')) is a parent of CWE-89, but CWE-89 is more specific and directly addresses the SQL injection aspect of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
