The HTML tag is broken, potentially allowing a Javascript injection attack.\\n*   **Impact of exploitation:** JavaScript injection.\\n*   **Attack vectors:**\\n    1.  Visit any wiki page, such that mw.Api() has loaded\\n    2.  Open the console\\n    3.  Perform any mw.Api call that generates HTML, such that you can make the first character inside a tag be U+0338 COMBINING LONG SOLIDUS OVERLAY.\\n\\n    For example, call { action: \\'visualeditor\\', paction: \\'parsefragment\\' } as follows:\\n\\n    ```\\n    const COMBINING_LONG_SOLIDUS = \\'\\\\u0338\\';\\n    new mw.Api().post( {\\n            action:  \\'visualeditor\\',\\n            paction: \\'parsefragment\\',\\n            page: \\'Test\\',\\n            wikitext: COMBINING_LONG_SOLIDUS + \\' onmouseover=\"alert(42)\" >content\\'\\n    } ).done( ( data ) => {\\n            const content = data.visualeditor.content;\\n            document.body.innerHTML = content\\n            console.log( \\'Content:\\', content );\\n    } ).fail( ( err ) => console.error( err ) );\\n    ```\\n\\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to inject the specific unicode character sequence (\\'>\\' + U+0338) into the HTML output. The attacker needs to be able to perform an mw.Api call and inject javascript.\\n*   **Mitigation or fix:** The patch ensures emitted HTML is safe against Unicode NFC normalization. The fix is to add U+0338 escaping to every place in Message.php which had a call to htmlspecialchars. The patches include:\\n    *   0001-Ensure-emitted-HTML-is-safe-against-Unicode-NFC-norm.patch\\n    *   0001-Entity-escape-U-0338-where-needed-to-make-HTML-outpu.patch\\n    *   Backports for the core patch in REL1\\\\_39, REL1\\\\_42, REL1\\\\_43, and master.\\n\\n**Content from phabricator.wikimedia.org_c7a21489_20250624_211403.html (text)**\\n\\nUNRELATED', similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {}, 'top_cwes_by_threshold': {}}}, similarity_summary=SimilarityInsight(consensus_cwe='', top_cwes=[], confidence_levels={}, total_samples=0), analysis='', analysis_with_relationships='', criticism='', resolution='', relevant_cwes=[{'metadata': {'doc_id': '113', 'name': \"Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\", 'source': 'sparse'}, 'similarity': np.float64(41.43929766885704)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '400', 'name': 'Uncontrolled Resource Consumption', 'source': 'sparse'}, 'similarity': np.float64(41.14903214750894)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '269', 'name': 'Improper Privilege Management', 'source': 'sparse'}, 'similarity': np.float64(40.988787133652686)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '77', 'name': \"Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')\", 'source': 'sparse'}, 'similarity': np.float64(39.62990446317546)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '201', 'name': 'Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data', 'source': 'sparse'}, 'similarity': np.float64(38.57068367042596)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '639', 'name': 'Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key', 'type': 'Base', 'original_content': \"The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\", 'source': 'dense', 'mapping_notes': {'usage': 'Allowed', 'rationale': 'This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.', 'comments': \"Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.\\n\\n  1. The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.\\n\\n  1. During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.\\n\\n  1. A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.\\n\\n  1. Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim\\'s web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server\\'s domain.\\n\\n  1. This effectively violates the intention of the web browser\\'s same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.\\n\\nThere are three main kinds of XSS:\\n\\n  -  **Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent)**  - The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker\\'s content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim\\'s browser.\\n\\n  -  **Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent)**  - The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker\\'s perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs. \\n\\n  -  **Type 0: DOM-Based XSS**  - In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible. \\n\\nOnce the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim\\'s machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim\\'s account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim\\'s machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"\\n\\nIn many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.\\n', 'alternate_terms': ['XSS', 'HTML Injection', 'CSS'], 'original_content': 'The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.', 'relationships': [{'source_id': '79', 'target_id': '87', 'label': 'PARENTOF', 'properties': {'ordinal': 'Primary', 'view_id': '1000'}}, {'source_id': '79', 'target_id': '86', 'label': 'PARENTOF', 'properties': {'ordinal': 'Primary', 'view_id': '1000'}}, {'source_id': '79', 'target_id': '85', 'label': 'PARENTOF', 'properties': {'ordinal': 'Primary', 'view_id': '1000'}}, {'source_id': '79', 'target_id': '84', 'label': 'PARENTOF', 'properties': {'ordinal': 'Primary', 'view_id': '1000'}}, {'source_id': '79', 'target_id': '83', 'label': 'PARENTOF', 'properties': {'ordinal': 'Primary', 'view_id': '1000'}}, {'source_id': '79', 'target_id': '81', 'label': 'PARENTOF', 'properties': {'ordinal': 'Primary', 'view_id': '1000'}}, {'source_id': '79', 'target_id': '80', 'label': 'PARENTOF', 'properties': {'ordinal': 'Primary', 'view_id': '1000'}}, {'source_id': '79', 'target_id': '184', 'label': 'CANFOLLOW', 'properties': {'view_id': '1000'}}, {'source_id': '79', 'target_id': '113', 'label': 'CANFOLLOW', 'properties': {'view_id': '1000'}}, {'source_id': '79', 'target_id': '352', 'label': 'PEEROF', 'properties': {'view_id': '1000'}}, {'source_id': '79', 'target_id': '494', 'label': 'CANPRECEDE', 'properties': {'view_id': '1000'}}, {'source_id': '79', 'target_id': '74', 'label': 'CHILDOF', 'properties': {'ordinal': 'Primary', 'view_id': '1003'}}, {'source_id': '79', 'target_id': '74', 'label': 'CHILDOF', 'properties': {'ordinal': 'Primary', 'view_id': '1000'}}, {'source_id': '87', 'target_id': '79', 'label': 'CHILDOF', 'properties': {'ordinal': 'Primary', 'view_id': '1000'}}, {'source_id': '86', 'target_id': '79', 'label': 'CHILDOF', 'properties': {'ordinal': 'Primary', 'view_id': '1000'}}, {'source_id': '85', 'target_id': '79', 'label': 'CHILDOF', 'properties': {'ordinal': 'Primary', 'view_id': '1000'}}, {'source_id': '84', 'target_id': '79', 'label': 'CHILDOF', 'properties': {'ordinal': 'Primary', 'view_id': '1000'}}, {'source_id': '83', 'target_id': '79', 'label': 'CHILDOF', 'properties': {'ordinal': 'Primary', 'view_id': '1000'}}, {'source_id': '81', 'target_id': '79', 'label': 'CHILDOF', 'properties': {'ordinal': 'Primary', 'view_id': '1000'}}, {'source_id': '80', 'target_id': '79', 'label': 'CHILDOF', 'properties': {'ordinal': 'Primary', 'view_id': '1000'}}, {'source_id': '74', 'target_id': '79', 'label': 'PARENTOF', 'properties': {'ordinal': 'Primary', 'view_id': '1000'}}, {'source_id': '494', 'target_id': '79', 'label': 'CANFOLLOW', 'properties': {'view_id': '1000'}}, {'source_id': '184', 'target_id': '79', 'label': 'CANPRECEDE', 'properties': {'view_id': '1000'}}, {'source_id': '113', 'target_id': '79', 'label': 'CANPRECEDE', 'properties': {'view_id': '1000'}}], 'source': 'graph', 'sources': ['vector', 'graph'], 'vector_score': 0.5773740389863106, 'graph_score': 4.329000000000001, 'score_components': {'relationship_chain': 1.0, 'explicit_mention': 1.0, 'abstraction_path': 0.9, 'sequence_path': 1.0}, 'abstraction_factor': 1.3, 'graph_path_info': {'path_types': ['relationship_chain', 'vulnerability_sequence_forward'], 'best_paths': {'relationship_chain': {'path': [('113', '79', 'CANPRECEDE')], 'score': 1.0, 'type': 'relationship_chain', 'source': '113'}, 'vulnerability_sequence_forward': {'path': [('113', '79', 'CANPRECEDE')], 'score': 1.0, 'type': 'vulnerability_sequence_forward', 'source': '113'}}}, 'is_explicit': True, 'abstraction_level': 'base', 'position': 'after', 'mapping_notes': {'usage': 'Allowed', 'rationale': 'This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.', 'comments': \"Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

However, including unexpected data in an HTTP header allows an attacker to specify the entirety of the HTTP message that is rendered by the client HTTP agent (e.g., web browser) or back-end HTTP agent (e.g., web server), whether the message is part of a request or a response. \n\n\nWhen an HTTP request contains unexpected CR and LF characters, the server may respond with an output stream that is interpreted as \"splitting\" the stream into two different HTTP messages instead of one. CR is carriage return, also given by %0d or \\r, and LF is line feed, also given by %0a or \\n.\n\n\nIn addition to CR and LF characters, other valid/RFC compliant special characters and unique character encodings can be utilized, such as HT (horizontal tab, also given by %09 or \\t) and SP (space, also given as + sign or %20).\n\n\nThese types of unvalidated and unexpected data in HTTP message headers allow an attacker to control the second \"split\" message to mount attacks such as server-side request forgery, cross-site scripting, and cache poisoning attacks.\n\n\nHTTP response splitting weaknesses may be present when:\n\n\n  1. Data enters a web application through an untrusted source, most frequently an HTTP request.\n\n  1. The data is included in an HTTP response header sent to a web user without neutralizing malicious characters that can be interpreted as separator characters for headers.\n\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-15811: Chain: Proxy uses a substring search instead of parsing the Transfer-Encoding header (CWE-697), allowing request splitting (CWE-113) and cache poisoning\n\n- CVE-2021-41084: Scala-based HTTP interface allows request splitting and response splitting through header names, header values, status reasons, and URIs\n\n- CVE-2018-12116: Javascript-based framework allows request splitting through a path option of an HTTP request\n\n- CVE-2004-2146: Application accepts CRLF in an object ID, allowing HTTP response splitting.\n\n- CVE-2004-1656: Shopping cart allows HTTP response splitting to perform HTML injection via CRLF in a parameter for a url\n\n- CVE-2005-2060: Bulletin board allows response splitting via CRLF in parameter.\n\n- CVE-2004-2512: Response splitting via CRLF in PHPSESSID.\n\n- CVE-2005-1951: e-commerce app allows HTTP response splitting using CRLF in object id parameters\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-0268: An Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Response Splitting') weakness in J-web of Juniper Networks Junos OS leads to buffer overflows, segment faults, or other impacts, which allows an attacker to modify the integrity of the device and exfiltration information from the device without authentication. The weakness can be exploited to facilitate cross-site scripting (XSS), cookie manipulation (modifying session cookies, stealing cookies) and more. This weakness can also be exploited by directing a user to a seemingly legitimate link from the affected site. The attacker requires no special access or permissions to the device to carry out such attacks. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS: 18.1 versions prior to 18.1R3-S11; 18.2 versions prior to 18.2R3-S5; 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R2-S4, 18.3R3-S3; 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R2-S5, 18.4R3-S3; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R2-S2, 19.1R3-S2; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S5, 19.2R2; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R3; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R1-S3, 19.4R2, 19.4R3; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R1-S2, 20.1R2. This issue does not affect Juniper Networks Junos OS versions prior to 18.1R1.\n\n- CVE-2021-28979: SafeNet KeySecure Management Console 8.12.0 is vulnerable to HTTP response splitting attacks. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using specially-crafted URL to cause the server to return a split response, once the URL is clicked.\n\n- CVE-2021-41084: http4s is an open source scala interface for HTTP. In affected versions http4s is vulnerable to response-splitting or request-splitting attacks when untrusted user input is used to create any of the following fields: Header names (`Header.name`\u00e5), Header values (`Header.value`), Status reason phrases (`Status.reason`), URI paths (`Uri.Path`), URI authority registered names (`URI.RegName`) (through 0.21). This issue has been resolved in versions 0.21.30, 0.22.5, 0.23.4, and 1.0.0-M27 perform the following. As a matter of practice http4s services and client applications should sanitize any user input in the aforementioned fields before returning a request or response to the backend. The carriage return, newline, and null characters are the most threatening.\n\n- CVE-2021-45818: SAFARI Montage 8.7.32 is affected by a CRLF injection vulnerability which can lead to HTTP response splitting.\n\n- CVE-2021-33621: The cgi gem before 0.1.0.2, 0.2.x before 0.2.2, and 0.3.x before 0.3.5 for Ruby allows HTTP response splitting. This is relevant to applications that use untrusted user input either to generate an HTTP response or to create a CGI::Cookie object.\n\n- CVE-2021-40336: A vulnerability exists in the http web interface where the web interface does not validate data in an HTTP header. This causes a possible HTTP response splitting, which if exploited could lead an attacker to channel down harmful code into the user\u2019s web browser, such as to steal the session cookies. Thus, an attacker who successfully makes an MSM user who has already established a session to MSM web interface clicks a forged link to the MSM web interface, e.g., the link is sent per E-Mail, could trick the user into downloading malicious software onto his computer. This issue affects: Hitachi Energy MSM V2.2 and prior versions.\n\n- CVE-2021-41437: An HTTP response splitting attack in web application in ASUS RT-AX88U before v3.0.0.4.388.20558 allows an attacker to craft a specific URL that if an authenticated victim visits it, the URL will give access to the cloud storage of the attacker.\n\n- CVE-2022-20772: A vulnerability in Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA) and Cisco Secure Email and Web Manager could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct an HTTP response splitting attack. This vulnerability is due to the failure of the application or its environment to properly sanitize input values. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious HTTP headers, controlling the response body, or splitting the response into multiple responses.\n\n- CVE-2022-35507: A response-header CRLF injection vulnerability in the Proxmox Virtual Environment (PVE) and Proxmox Mail Gateway (PMG) web interface allows a remote attacker to set cookies for a victim's browser that are longer than the server expects, causing a client-side DoS. This affects Chromium-based browsers because they allow injection of response headers with %0d. This is fixed in pve-http-server 4.1-3.\n\n- CVE-2022-37240: MDaemon Technologies SecurityGateway for Email Servers 8.5.2 is vulnerable to HTTP Response splitting via the format parameter.\n\n- CVE-2022-37242: MDaemon Technologies SecurityGateway for Email Servers 8.5.2, is vulnerable to HTTP Response splitting via the data parameter.\n\n- CVE-2022-37953: An HTTP response splitting vulnerability exists in the AM Gateway Challenge-Response dialog of WorkstationST (<v07.09.15) and could allow an attacker to compromise a victim's browser/session. WorkstationST is only deployed in specific, controlled environments rendering attack complexity significantly higher than if the attack were conducted on the software in isolation. WorkstationST v07.09.15 can be found in ControlST v07.09.07 SP8 and greater.\n\n- CVE-2022-42471: An improper neutralization of CRLF sequences in HTTP headers ('HTTP Response Splitting') vulnerability [CWE-113] In FortiWeb version 7.0.0 through 7.0.2, FortiWeb version 6.4.0 through 6.4.2, FortiWeb version 6.3.6 through 6.3.20 may allow an authenticated and remote attacker to inject arbitrary headers.\n\n- CVE-2022-42472: A improper neutralization of crlf sequences in http headers ('http response splitting') in Fortinet FortiOS versions 7.2.0 through 7.2.2, 7.0.0 through 7.0.8, 6.4.0 through 6.4.11, 6.2.0 through 6.2.12, 6.0.0 through 6.0.16, FortiProxy 7.2.0 through 7.2.1, 7.0.0 through 7.0.7, 2.0.0 through 2.0.10, 1.2.0 through 1.2.13, 1.1.0 through 1.1.6 may allow an authenticated and remote attacker to perform an HTTP request splitting attack which gives attackers control of the remaining headers and body of the response.\n\n- CVE-2022-47052: The web interface of the 'Nighthawk R6220 AC1200 Smart Wi-Fi Router' is vulnerable to a CRLF Injection attack that can be leveraged to perform Reflected XSS and HTML Injection. A malicious unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability using a specially crafted URL. This affects firmware versions: V1.1.0.112_1.0.1, V1.1.0.114_1.0.1.\n\n- CVE-2021-37499: CRLF vulnerability in Reprise License Manager (RLM) web interface through 14.2BL4 in the password parameter in View License Result function, that allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary HTTP headers.\n\n- CVE-2022-32453: HTTP header injection vulnerability in Cybozu Office 10.0.0 to 10.8.5 may allow a remote attacker to obtain and/or alter the data of the product via unspecified vectors.\n\n- CVE-2022-3918: A program using FoundationNetworking in swift-corelibs-foundation is potentially vulnerable to CRLF ( ) injection in URLRequest headers. In this vulnerability, a client can insert one or several CRLF sequences into a URLRequest header value. When that request is sent via URLSession to an HTTP server, the server may interpret the content after the CRLF as extra headers, or even a second request. For example, consider a URLRequest to http://example.com/ with the GET method. Suppose we set the URLRequest header \"Foo\" to the value \"Bar Extra-Header: Added GET /other HTTP/1.1\". When this request is sent, it will appear to the server as two requests: GET / HTTP/1.1 Foo: Bar Extra-Header: Added GET /other HTTP/1.1 In this manner, the client is able to inject extra headers and craft an entirely new request to a separate path, despite only making one API call in URLSession. If a developer has total control over the request and its headers, this vulnerability may not pose a threat. However, this vulnerability escalates if un-sanitized user input is placed in header values. If so, a malicious user could inject new headers or requests to an intermediary or backend server. Developers should be especially careful to sanitize user input in this case, or upgrade their version of swift-corelibs-foundation to include the patch below.\n\n- CVE-2022-4188: Insufficient validation of untrusted input in CORS in Google Chrome on Android prior to 108.0.5359.71 allowed a remote attacker to bypass same origin policy via a crafted HTML page.

If an attacker can trigger the allocation of these limited resources, but the number or size of the resources is not controlled, then the attacker could cause a denial of service that consumes all available resources. This would prevent valid users from accessing the product, and it could potentially have an impact on the surrounding environment. For example, a memory exhaustion attack against an application could slow down the application as well as its host operating system.\n\n\nThere are at least three distinct scenarios which can commonly lead to resource exhaustion:\n\n\n  - Lack of throttling for the number of allocated resources\n\n  - Losing all references to a resource before reaching the shutdown stage\n\n  - Not closing/returning a resource after processing\n\nResource exhaustion problems are often result due to an incorrect implementation of the following situations:\n\n  - Error conditions and other exceptional circumstances.\n\n  - Confusion over which part of the program is responsible for releasing the resource.\n\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-21668: Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).\n\n- CVE-2020-7218: Go-based workload orchestrator does not limit resource usage with unauthenticated connections, allowing a DoS by flooding the service\n\n- CVE-2020-3566: Resource exhaustion in distributed OS because of \"insufficient\" IGMP queue management, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2009-2874: Product allows attackers to cause a crash via a large number of connections.\n\n- CVE-2009-1928: Malformed request triggers uncontrolled recursion, leading to stack exhaustion.\n\n- CVE-2009-2858: Chain: memory leak (CWE-404) leads to resource exhaustion.\n\n- CVE-2009-2726: Driver does not use a maximum width when invoking sscanf style functions, causing stack consumption.\n\n- CVE-2009-2540: Large integer value for a length property in an object causes a large amount of memory allocation.\n\n- CVE-2009-2299: Web application firewall consumes excessive memory when an HTTP request contains a large Content-Length value but no POST data.\n\n- CVE-2009-2054: Product allows exhaustion of file descriptors when processing a large number of TCP packets.\n\n- CVE-2008-5180: Communication product allows memory consumption with a large number of SIP requests, which cause many sessions to be created.\n\n- CVE-2008-2121: TCP implementation allows attackers to consume CPU and prevent new connections using a TCP SYN flood attack.\n\n- CVE-2008-2122: Port scan triggers CPU consumption with processes that attempt to read data from closed sockets.\n\n- CVE-2008-1700: Product allows attackers to cause a denial of service via a large number of directives, each of which opens a separate window.\n\n- CVE-2007-4103: Product allows resource exhaustion via a large number of calls that do not complete a 3-way handshake.\n\n- CVE-2006-1173: Mail server does not properly handle deeply nested multipart MIME messages, leading to stack exhaustion.\n\n- CVE-2007-0897: Chain: anti-virus product encounters a malformed file but returns from a function without closing a file descriptor (CWE-775) leading to file descriptor consumption (CWE-400) and failed scans.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-22101: Cloud Controller versions prior to 1.118.0 are vulnerable to unauthenticated denial of Service(DoS) vulnerability allowing unauthenticated attackers to cause denial of service by using REST HTTP requests with label_selectors on multiple V3 endpoints by generating an enormous SQL query.\n\n- CVE-2021-1266: A vulnerability in the REST API of Cisco Managed Services Accelerator (MSX) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to the way that the affected software logs certain API requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a flood of crafted API requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition on the affected device.\n\n- CVE-2021-1312: A vulnerability in the system resource management of Cisco Elastic Services Controller (ESC) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) to the health monitor API on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to inadequate provisioning of kernel parameters for the maximum number of TCP connections and SYN backlog. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a flood of crafted TCP packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to block TCP listening ports that are used by the health monitor API. This vulnerability only affects customers who use the health monitor API.\n\n- CVE-2021-1378: A vulnerability in the SSH service of the Cisco StarOS operating system could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to stop processing traffic, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to a logic error that may occur under specific traffic conditions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of crafted packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to prevent the targeted service from receiving any traffic, which would lead to a DoS condition on the affected device.\n\n- CVE-2021-1489: A vulnerability in filesystem usage management for Cisco Firepower Device Manager (FDM) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to exhaust filesystem resources, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to the insufficient management of available filesystem resources. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading files to the device and exhausting available filesystem resources. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause database errors and cause the device to become unresponsive to web-based management. Manual intervention is required to free filesystem resources and return the device to an operational state.\n\n- CVE-2021-1460: A vulnerability in the Cisco IOx Application Framework of Cisco 809 Industrial Integrated Services Routers (Industrial ISRs), Cisco 829 Industrial ISRs, Cisco CGR 1000 Compute Module, and Cisco IC3000 Industrial Compute Gateway could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient error handling during packet processing. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a high and sustained rate of crafted TCP traffic to the IOx web server on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the IOx web server to stop processing requests, resulting in a DoS condition.\n\n- CVE-2021-0285: An uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability in Juniper Networks Junos OS on QFX5000 Series and EX4600 Series switches allows an attacker sending large amounts of legitimate traffic destined to the device to cause Interchassis Control Protocol (ICCP) interruptions, leading to an unstable control connection between the Multi-Chassis Link Aggregation Group (MC-LAG) nodes which can in turn lead to traffic loss. Continued receipt of this amount of traffic will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition. An indication that the system could be impacted by this issue is the following log message: \"DDOS_PROTOCOL_VIOLATION_SET: Warning: Host-bound traffic for protocol/exception LOCALNH:aggregate exceeded its allowed bandwidth at fpc <fpc number> for <n> times, started at <timestamp>\" This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on QFX5000 Series and EX4600 Series: 15.1 versions prior to 15.1R7-S9; 17.3 versions prior to 17.3R3-S11; 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R2-S13, 17.4R3-S5; 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R3-S5; 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R2-S8, 18.4R3-S7; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R3-S5; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S6, 19.2R3-S2; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R2-S6, 19.3R3-S2; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R1-S4, 19.4R2-S4, 19.4R3-S2; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R2-S2, 20.1R3; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R2-S3, 20.2R3; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R2; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R1-S1, 20.4R2.\n\n- CVE-2021-22119: Spring Security versions 5.5.x prior to 5.5.1, 5.4.x prior to 5.4.7, 5.3.x prior to 5.3.10 and 5.2.x prior to 5.2.11 are susceptible to a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack via the initiation of the Authorization Request in an OAuth 2.0 Client Web and WebFlux application. A malicious user or attacker can send multiple requests initiating the Authorization Request for the Authorization Code Grant, which has the potential of exhausting system resources using a single session or multiple sessions.\n\n- CVE-2021-43173: In NLnet Labs Routinator prior to 0.10.2, a validation run can be delayed significantly by an RRDP repository by not answering but slowly drip-feeding bytes to keep the connection alive. This can be used to effectively stall validation. While Routinator has a configurable time-out value for RRDP connections, this time-out was only applied to individual read or write operations rather than the complete request. Thus, if an RRDP repository sends a little bit of data before that time-out expired, it can continuously extend the time it takes for the request to finish. Since validation will only continue once the update of an RRDP repository has concluded, this delay will cause validation to stall, leading to Routinator continuing to serve the old data set or, if in the initial validation run directly after starting, never serve any data at all.\n\n- CVE-2020-12291: Uncontrolled resource consumption in some Intel(R) Thunderbolt(TM) controllers may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable denial of service via local access.\n\n- CVE-2020-12296: Uncontrolled resource consumption in some Intel(R) Thunderbolt(TM) controllers may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable denial of service via local access.\n\n- CVE-2020-1702: A malicious container image can consume an unbounded amount of memory when being pulled to a container runtime host, such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux using podman, or OpenShift Container Platform.

The resolution is to limit the number of allowable transforms to 2.\n\n- CVE-2021-21271: Tendermint Core is an open source Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) middleware that takes a state transition machine - written in any programming language - and securely replicates it on many machines. Tendermint Core v0.34.0 introduced a new way of handling evidence of misbehavior. As part of this, we added a new Timestamp field to Evidence structs. This timestamp would be calculated using the same algorithm that is used when a block is created and proposed. (This algorithm relies on the timestamp of the last commit from this specific block.) In Tendermint Core v0.34.0-v0.34.2, the consensus reactor is responsible for forming DuplicateVoteEvidence whenever double signs are observed. However, the current block is still \u201cin flight\u201d when it is being formed by the consensus reactor. It hasn\u2019t been finalized through network consensus yet. This means that different nodes in the network may observe different \u201clast commits\u201d when assigning a timestamp to DuplicateVoteEvidence. In turn, different nodes could form DuplicateVoteEvidence objects at the same height but with different timestamps. One DuplicateVoteEvidence object (with one timestamp) will then eventually get finalized in the block, but this means that any DuplicateVoteEvidence with a different timestamp is considered invalid. Any node that formed invalid DuplicateVoteEvidence will continue to propose invalid evidence; its peers may see this, and choose to disconnect from this node. This bug means that double signs are DoS vectors in Tendermint Core v0.34.0-v0.34.2. Tendermint Core v0.34.3 is a security release which fixes this bug. As of v0.34.3, DuplicateVoteEvidence is no longer formed by the consensus reactor; rather, the consensus reactor passes the Votes themselves into the EvidencePool, which is now responsible for forming DuplicateVoteEvidence. The EvidencePool has timestamp info that should be consistent across the network, which means that DuplicateVoteEvidence formed in this reactor should have consistent timestamps. This release changes the API between the consensus and evidence reactors.\n\n- CVE-2021-21328: Vapor is a web framework for Swift. In Vapor before version 4.40.1, there is a DoS attack against anyone who Bootstraps a metrics backend for their Vapor app. The following is the attack vector: 1. send unlimited requests against a vapor instance with different paths. this will create unlimited counters and timers, which will eventually drain the system. 2. downstream services might suffer from this attack as well by being spammed with error paths. This has been patched in 4.40.1.

Note: Software versions which have reached End of Technical Support (EoTS) are not evaluated\n\n- CVE-2022-29864: OPC UA .NET Standard Stack 1.04.368 allows a remote attacker to cause a server to crash via a large number of messages that trigger Uncontrolled Resource Consumption.\n\n- CVE-2022-29866: OPC UA .NET Standard Stack 1.04.368 allows a remote attacker to exhaust the memory resources of a server via a crafted request that triggers Uncontrolled Resource Consumption.\n\n- CVE-2022-30551: OPC UA Legacy Java Stack 2022-04-01 allows a remote attacker to cause a server to stop processing messages by sending crafted messages that exhaust available resources.\n\n- CVE-2022-30691: Uncontrolled resource consumption in the Intel(R) Support Android application before version 22.02.28 may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable denial of service via local access.\n\n- CVE-2022-30791: In CmpBlkDrvTcp of CODESYS V3 in multiple versions an uncontrolled ressource consumption allows an unauthorized attacker to block new TCP connections. Existing connections are not affected.\n\n- CVE-2022-30792: In CmpChannelServer of CODESYS V3 in multiple versions an uncontrolled ressource consumption allows an unauthorized attacker to block new communication channel connections. Existing connections are not affected.\n\n- CVE-2022-31006: indy-node is the server portion of Hyperledger Indy, a distributed ledger purpose-built for decentralized identity. In vulnerable versions of indy-node, an attacker can max out the number of client connections allowed by the ledger, leaving the ledger unable to be used for its intended purpose. However, the ledger content will not be impacted and the ledger will resume functioning after the attack. This attack exploits the trade-off between resilience and availability. Any protection against abusive client connections will also prevent the network being accessed by certain legitimate users. As a result, validator nodes must tune their firewall rules to ensure the right trade-off for their network's expected users. The guidance to network operators for the use of firewall rules in the deployment of Indy networks has been modified to better protect against denial of service attacks by increasing the cost and complexity in mounting such attacks. The mitigation for this vulnerability is not in the Hyperledger Indy code per se, but rather in the individual deployments of Indy. The mitigations should be applied to all deployments of Indy, and are not related to a particular release.\n\n- CVE-2022-31030: containerd is an open source container runtime. A bug was found in the containerd's CRI implementation where programs inside a container can cause the containerd daemon to consume memory without bound during invocation of the `ExecSync` API. This can cause containerd to consume all available memory on the computer, denying service to other legitimate workloads. Kubernetes and crictl can both be configured to use containerd's CRI implementation; `ExecSync` may be used when running probes or when executing processes via an \"exec\" facility. This bug has been fixed in containerd 1.6.6 and 1.5.13. Users should update to these versions to resolve the issue. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that only trusted images and commands are used.\n\n- CVE-2022-31073: KubeEdge is an open source system for extending native containerized application orchestration capabilities to hosts at Edge. Prior to versions 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4, the ServiceBus server on the edge side may be susceptible to a DoS attack if an HTTP request containing a very large Body is sent to it. It is possible for the node to be exhausted of memory. The consequence of the exhaustion is that other services on the node, e.g. other containers, will be unable to allocate memory and thus causing a denial of service. Malicious apps accidentally pulled by users on the host and have the access to send HTTP requests to localhost may make an attack. It will be affected only when users enable the `ServiceBus` module in the config file `edgecore.yaml`. This bug has been fixed in Kubeedge 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4. As a workaround, disable the `ServiceBus` module in the config file `edgecore.yaml`.\n\n- CVE-2022-31074: KubeEdge is an open source system for extending native containerized application orchestration capabilities to hosts at Edge. Prior to versions 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4, several endpoints in the Cloud AdmissionController may be susceptible to a DoS attack if an HTTP request containing a very large Body is sent to it. The consequence of the exhaustion is that the Cloud AdmissionController will be in denial of service. This bug has been fixed in Kubeedge 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4. There is currently no known workaround.\n\n- CVE-2022-3283: A potential DOS vulnerability was discovered in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions before before 15.2.5, all versions starting from 15.3 before 15.3.4, all versions starting from 15.4 before 15.4.1 While cloning an issue with special crafted content added to the description could have been used to trigger high CPU usage.\n\n- CVE-2022-33203: In BIG-IP Versions 16.1.x before 16.1.3, 15.1.x before 15.1.6.1, and 14.1.x before 14.1.5, when a BIG-IP APM access policy with Service Connect agent is configured on a virtual server, undisclosed requests can cause an increase in memory resource utilization.

Improper data handling on branch creation could have been used to trigger high CPU usage.\n\n- CVE-2022-3818: An uncontrolled resource consumption issue when parsing URLs in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions prior to 15.3.5, 15.4 prior to 15.4.4, and 15.5 prior to 15.5.2 allows an attacker to cause performance issues and potentially a denial of service on the GitLab instance.\n\n- CVE-2022-39278: Istio is an open platform-independent service mesh that provides traffic management, policy enforcement, and telemetry collection. Prior to versions 1.15.2, 1.14.5, and 1.13.9, the Istio control plane, istiod, is vulnerable to a request processing error, allowing a malicious attacker that sends a specially crafted or oversized message which results in the control plane crashing when the Kubernetes validating or mutating webhook service is exposed publicly. This endpoint is served over TLS port 15017, but does not require any authentication from the attacker. For simple installations, Istiod is typically only reachable from within the cluster, limiting the blast radius. However, for some deployments, especially external istiod topologies, this port is exposed over the public internet. Versions 1.15.2, 1.14.5, and 1.13.9 contain patches for this issue. There are no effective workarounds, beyond upgrading. This bug is due to an error in `regexp.Compile` in Go.\n\n- CVE-2022-39330: Nextcloud Server is the file server software for Nextcloud, a self-hosted productivity platform. Nextcloud Server prior to versions 23.0.10 and 24.0.6 and Nextcloud Enterprise Server prior to versions 22.2.10, 23.0.10, and 24.0.6 are vulnerable to a logged-in attacker slowing down the system by generating a lot of database/cpu load. Nextcloud Server versions 23.0.10 and 24.0.6 and Nextcloud Enterprise Server versions 22.2.10, 23.0.10, and 24.0.6 contain patches for this issue. As a workaround, disable the Circles app.\n\n- CVE-2022-40735: The Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement Protocol allows use of long exponents that arguably make certain calculations unnecessarily expensive, because the 1996 van Oorschot and Wiener paper found that \"(appropriately) short exponents\" can be used when there are adequate subgroup constraints, and these short exponents can lead to less expensive calculations than for long exponents. This issue is different from CVE-2002-20001 because it is based on an observation about exponent size, rather than an observation about numbers that are not public keys. The specific situations in which calculation expense would constitute a server-side vulnerability depend on the protocol (e.g., TLS, SSH, or IKE) and the DHE implementation details. In general, there might be an availability concern because of server-side resource consumption from DHE modular-exponentiation calculations. Finally, it is possible for an attacker to exploit this vulnerability and CVE-2002-20001 together.\n\n- CVE-2022-41770: In BIG-IP versions 17.0.x before 17.0.0.1, 16.1.x before 16.1.3.1, 15.1.x before 15.1.7, 14.1.x before 14.1.5.1, and all versions of 13.1.x, and BIG-IQ all versions of 8.x and 7.x, an authenticated iControl REST user can cause an increase in memory resource utilization, via undisclosed requests.\n\n- CVE-2022-41806: In versions 16.1.x before 16.1.3.2 and 15.1.x before 15.1.5.1, when BIG-IP AFM Network Address Translation policy with IPv6/IPv4 translation rules is configured on a virtual server, undisclosed requests can cause an increase in memory resource utilization.\n\n- CVE-2022-41833: In all BIG-IP 13.1.x versions, when an iRule containing the HTTP::collect command is configured on a virtual server, undisclosed requests can cause Traffic Management Microkernel (TMM) to terminate.\n\n- CVE-2022-4344: Memory exhaustion in the Kafka protocol dissector in Wireshark 4.0.0 to 4.0.1 and 3.6.0 to 3.6.9 allows denial of service via packet injection or crafted capture file\n\n- CVE-2022-20692: A vulnerability in the NETCONF over SSH feature of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow a low-privileged, authenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service condition (DoS) on an affected device.

A compromised pod with sufficient privilege is able to reconfigure the node\u2019s IPv6 interface due to the node accepting route advertisement by default, allowing the attacker to redirect full or partial network traffic from the node to the compromised pod.\n\n- CVE-2020-14371: A credential leak vulnerability was found in Red Hat Satellite. This flaw exposes the compute resources credentials through VMs that are running on these resources in Satellite.\n\n- CVE-2021-20228: A flaw was found in the Ansible Engine 2.9.18, where sensitive info is not masked by default and is not protected by the no_log feature when using the sub-option feature of the basic.py module. This flaw allows an attacker to obtain sensitive information. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality.\n\n- CVE-2021-20331:  Specific versions of the MongoDB C# Driver may erroneously publish events containing authentication-related data to a command listener configured by an application. The published events may contain security-sensitive data when commands such as \"saslStart\", \"saslContinue\", \"isMaster\", \"createUser\", and \"updateUser\" are executed. Without due care, an application may inadvertently expose this authenticated-related information, e.g., by writing it to a log file. This issue only arises if an application enables the command listener feature (this is not enabled by default). This issue affects the MongoDB C# Driver v2.12 versions prior to and including 2.12.1. \n\n- CVE-2021-26593: In Directus 8.x through 8.8.1, an attacker can see all users in the CMS using the API /users/{id}. For each call, they get in response a lot of information about the user (such as email address, first name, and last name) but also the secret for 2FA if one exists. This secret can be regenerated. NOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer\n\n- CVE-2021-28133: Zoom through 5.5.4 sometimes allows attackers to read private information on a participant's screen, even though the participant never attempted to share the private part of their screen. When a user shares a specific application window via the Share Screen functionality, other meeting participants can briefly see contents of other application windows that were explicitly not shared. The contents of these other windows can (for instance) be seen for a short period of time when they overlay the shared window and get into focus. (An attacker can, of course, use a separate screen-recorder application, unsupported by Zoom, to save all such contents for later replays and analysis.) Depending on the unintentionally shared data, this short exposure of screen contents may be a more or less severe security issue.\n\n- CVE-2021-29483: ManageWiki is an extension to the MediaWiki project. The 'wikiconfig' API leaked the value of private configuration variables set through the ManageWiki variable to all users. This has been patched by https://github.com/miraheze/ManageWiki/compare/99f3b2c8af18...befb83c66f5b.patch. If you are unable to patch set `$wgAPIListModules['wikiconfig'] = 'ApiQueryDisabled';` or remove private config as a workaround.\n\n- CVE-2021-31545: An issue was discovered in the AbuseFilter extension for MediaWiki through 1.35.2. The page_recent_contributors leaked the existence of certain deleted MediaWiki usernames, related to rev_deleted.\n\n- CVE-2021-31549: An issue was discovered in the AbuseFilter extension for MediaWiki through 1.35.2. The Special:AbuseFilter/examine form allowed for the disclosure of suppressed MediaWiki usernames to unprivileged users.\n\n- CVE-2021-32747: Icinga Web 2 is an open source monitoring web interface, framework, and command-line interface. A vulnerability in which custom variables are exposed to unauthorized users exists between versions 2.0.0 and 2.8.2. Custom variables are user-defined keys and values on configuration objects in Icinga 2. These are commonly used to reference secrets in other configurations such as check commands to be able to authenticate with a service being checked. Icinga Web 2 displays these custom variables to logged in users with access to said hosts or services. In order to protect the secrets from being visible to anyone, it's possible to setup protection rules and blacklists in a user's role. Protection rules result in `***` being shown instead of the original value, the key will remain. Backlists will hide a custom variable entirely from the user. Besides using the UI, custom variables can also be accessed differently by using an undocumented URL parameter. By adding a parameter to the affected routes, Icinga Web 2 will show these columns additionally in the respective list. This parameter is also respected when exporting to JSON or CSV. Protection rules and blacklists however have no effect in this case. Custom variables are shown as-is in the result. The issue has been fixed in the 2.9.0, 2.8.3, and 2.7.5 releases. As a workaround, one may set up a restriction to hide hosts and services with the custom variable in question.\n\n- CVE-2020-27831: A flaw was found in Red Hat Quay, where it does not properly protect the authorization token when authorizing email addresses for repository email notifications. This flaw allows an attacker to add email addresses they do not own to repository notifications.\n\n- CVE-2021-21396: wire-server is an open-source back end for Wire, a secure collaboration platform. In wire-server from version 2021-02-16 and before version 2021-03-02, the client metadata of all users was exposed in the `GET /users/list-clients` endpoint. The endpoint could be used by any logged in user who could request client details of any other user (no connection required) as far as they can find their User ID. The exposed metadata included id, class, type, location, time, and cookie. A user on a Wire backend could use this endpoint to find registration time and location for each device for a given list of users. As a workaround, remove `/list-clients` from nginx config. This has been fixed in version 2021-03-02.\n\n- CVE-2021-21400: wire-webapp is an open-source front end for Wire, a secure collaboration platform. In wire-webapp before version 2021-03-15-production.0, when being prompted to enter the app-lock passphrase, the typed passphrase will be sent into the most recently used chat when the user does not actively give focus to the input field. Input element focus is enforced programatically in version 2021-03-15-production.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-21621: Jenkins Support Core Plugin 2.72 and earlier provides the serialized user authentication as part of the \"About user (basic authentication details only)\" information, which can include the session ID of the user creating the support bundle in some configurations.\n\n- CVE-2021-21733: The management system of ZXCDN is impacted by the information leak vulnerability. Attackers can make further analysis according to the information returned by the program, and then obtain some sensitive information. This affects ZXCDN V7.01 all versions up to IAMV7.01.01.02.\n\n- CVE-2021-21823: An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the Friend finder functionality of GmbH Komoot version 10.26.9 up to 11.1.11. A specially crafted series of network requests can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information.\n\n- CVE-2021-22905: Nextcloud Android App (com.nextcloud.client) before v3.16.0 is vulnerable to information disclosure due to searches for sharees being performed by default on the lookup server instead of only using the local Nextcloud server unless a global search has been explicitly chosen by the user.\n\n- CVE-2021-22912: Nextcloud iOS before 3.4.2 suffers from an information disclosure vulnerability when searches for sharees utilize the lookup server by default instead of only on the local Nextcloud server unless a global search has been explicitly chosen by the user.\n\n- CVE-2021-22913: Nextcloud Deck before 1.2.7, 1.4.1 suffers from an information disclosure vulnerability when searches for sharees utilize the lookup server by default instead of only the local Nextcloud server unless a global search has been explicitly chosen by the user.\n\n- CVE-2021-41109: Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to version 4.10.4, for regular (non-LiveQuery) queries, the session token is removed from the response, but for LiveQuery payloads it is currently not. If a user has a LiveQuery subscription on the `Parse.User` class, all session tokens created during user sign-ups will be broadcast as part of the LiveQuery payload. A patch in version 4.10.4 removes session tokens from the LiveQuery payload. As a workaround, set `user.acl(new Parse.ACL())` in a beforeSave trigger to make the user private already on sign-up.\n\n- CVE-2021-41125: Scrapy is a high-level web crawling and scraping framework for Python. If you use `HttpAuthMiddleware` (i.e. the `http_user` and `http_pass` spider attributes) for HTTP authentication, all requests will expose your credentials to the request target. This includes requests generated by Scrapy components, such as `robots.txt` requests sent by Scrapy when the `ROBOTSTXT_OBEY` setting is set to `True`, or as requests reached through redirects. Upgrade to Scrapy 2.5.1 and use the new `http_auth_domain` spider attribute to control which domains are allowed to receive the configured HTTP authentication credentials. If you are using Scrapy 1.8 or a lower version, and upgrading to Scrapy 2.5.1 is not an option, you may upgrade to Scrapy 1.8.1 instead. If you cannot upgrade, set your HTTP authentication credentials on a per-request basis, using for example the `w3lib.http.basic_auth_header` function to convert your credentials into a value that you can assign to the `Authorization` header of your request, instead of defining your credentials globally using `HttpAuthMiddleware`.\n\n- CVE-2021-42089: An issue was discovered in Zammad before 4.1.1. The REST API discloses sensitive information.\n\n- CVE-2021-0602: In onCreateOptionsMenu of WifiNetworkDetailsFragment.java, there is a possible way for guest users to view and modify Wi-Fi settings for all configured APs due to a permissions bypass. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-10 Android-11Android ID: A-177573895\n\n- CVE-2021-37703: Discourse is an open-source platform for community discussion.

When a node has been copied from a protected location, users with access to the copy can see the 'copyfrom' path of the original. This also reveals the fact that the node was copied. Only the 'copyfrom' path is revealed; not its contents. Both httpd and svnserve servers are vulnerable.\n\n- CVE-2021-45310: Sangoma Technologies Corporation Switchvox Version 102409 is affected by an information disclosure vulnerability due to an improper access restriction. Users information such as first name, last name, acount id, server uuid, email address, profile image, number, timestamps, etc can be extracted by sending an unauthenticated HTTP GET request to the https://Switchvox-IP/main?cmd=invalid_browser.\n\n- CVE-2021-25118: The Yoast SEO WordPress plugin (from versions 16.7 until 17.2) discloses the full internal path of featured images in posts via the wp/v2/posts REST endpoints which could help an attacker identify other vulnerabilities or help during the exploitation of other identified vulnerabilities.\n\n- CVE-2021-38956: IBM Security Verify 10.0.0, 10.0.1.0, and 10.0.2.0 could disclose sensitive version information in HTTP response headers that could aid in further attacks against the system.

There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-0654: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor in GitHub repository fgribreau/node-request-retry prior to 7.0.0.\n\n- CVE-2022-0577: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor in GitHub repository scrapy/scrapy prior to 2.6.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-30334: Brave before 1.34, when a Private Window with Tor Connectivity is used, leaks .onion URLs in Referer and Origin headers. NOTE: although this was fixed by Brave, the Brave documentation still advises \"Note that Private Windows with Tor Connectivity in Brave are just regular private windows that use Tor as a proxy. Brave does NOT implement most of the privacy protections from Tor Browser.\"\n\n- CVE-2022-39193: An issue was discovered in the CheckUser extension for MediaWiki through 1.39.x. Various components of this extension can expose information on the performer of edits and logged actions. This information should not allow public viewing: it is supposed to be viewable only by users with suppression rights.\n\n- CVE-2022-31308: A vulnerability in live_mfg.shtml of WAVLINK AERIAL X 1200M M79X3.V5030.191012 allows attackers to obtain sensitive router information via execution of the exec cmd function.\n\n- CVE-2022-31309: A vulnerability in live_check.shtml of WAVLINK AERIAL X 1200M M79X3.V5030.180719 allows attackers to obtain sensitive router information via execution of the exec cmd function.\n\n- CVE-2022-35147: DoraCMS v2.18 and earlier allows attackers to bypass login authentication via a crafted HTTP request.\n\n- CVE-2021-20260: A flaw was found in the Foreman project. The Datacenter plugin exposes the password through the API to an authenticated local attacker with view_hosts permission. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.\n\n- CVE-2022-23538: github.com/sylabs/scs-library-client is the Go client for the Singularity Container Services (SCS) Container Library Service. When the scs-library-client is used to pull a container image, with authentication, the HTTP Authorization header sent by the client to the library service may be incorrectly leaked to an S3 backing storage provider. This occurs in a specific flow, where the library service redirects the client to a backing S3 storage server, to perform a multi-part concurrent download. Depending on site configuration, the S3 service may be provided by a third party. An attacker with access to the S3 service may be able to extract user credentials, allowing them to impersonate the user. The vulnerable multi-part concurrent download flow, with redirect to S3, is only used when communicating with a Singularity Enterprise 1.x installation, or third party server implementing this flow. Interaction with Singularity Enterprise 2.x, and Singularity Container Services (cloud.sylabs.io), does not trigger the vulnerable flow. We encourage all users to update. Users who interact with a Singularity Enterprise 1.x installation, using a 3rd party S3 storage service, are advised to revoke and recreate their authentication tokens within Singularity Enterprise. There is no workaround available at this time.\n\n- CVE-2022-31130: Grafana is an open source observability and data visualization platform. Versions of Grafana for endpoints prior to 9.1.8 and 8.5.14 could leak authentication tokens to some destination plugins under some conditions. The vulnerability impacts data source and plugin proxy endpoints with authentication tokens. The destination plugin could receive a user's Grafana authentication token. Versions 9.1.8 and 8.5.14 contain a patch for this issue. As a workaround, do not use API keys, JWT authentication, or any HTTP Header based authentication.\n\n- CVE-2022-42132: The Test LDAP Users functionality in Liferay Portal 7.0.0 through 7.4.3.4, and Liferay DXP 7.0 fix pack 102 and earlier, 7.1 before fix pack 27, 7.2 before fix pack 17, 7.3 before update 4, and DXP 7.4 GA includes the LDAP credential in the page URL when paginating through the list of users, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers or attackers with access to the request logs to see the LDAP credential.\n\n- CVE-2022-31746: Internal URLs are protected by a secret UUID key, which could have been leaked to web page through the Referrer header. This vulnerability affects Firefox for iOS < 102.\n\n- CVE-2021-23937: A DNS proxy and possible amplification attack vulnerability in WebClientInfo of Apache Wicket allows an attacker to trigger arbitrary DNS lookups from the server when the X-Forwarded-For header is not properly sanitized. This DNS lookup can be engineered to overload an internal DNS server or to slow down request processing of the Apache Wicket application causing a possible denial of service on either the internal infrastructure or the web application itself. This issue affects Apache Wicket Apache Wicket 9.x version 9.2.0 and prior versions; Apache Wicket 8.x version 8.11.0 and prior versions; Apache Wicket 7.x version 7.17.0 and prior versions and Apache Wicket 6.x version 6.2.0 and later versions.\n\n- CVE-2022-0474: Full list of recipients from customer users in a contact field could be disclosed in notification emails event when the notification is set to be sent to each recipient individually. This issue affects: OTRS AG OTRSCustomContactFields 8.0.x version: 8.0.11 and prior versions.\n\n- CVE-2022-1595: The HC Custom WP-Admin URL WordPress plugin through 1.4 leaks the secret login URL when sending a specific crafted request\n\n- CVE-2022-21642: Discourse is an open source platform for community discussion. In affected versions when composing a message from topic the composer user suggestions reveals whisper participants. The issue has been patched in stable version 2.7.13 and beta version 2.8.0.beta11. There is no workaround for this issue and users are advised to upgrade.\n\n- CVE-2022-21712: twisted is an event-driven networking engine written in Python. In affected versions twisted exposes cookies and authorization headers when following cross-origin redirects. This issue is present in the `twited.web.RedirectAgent` and `twisted.web. BrowserLikeRedirectAgent` functions. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-24737: HTTPie is a command-line HTTP client. HTTPie has the practical concept of sessions, which help users to persistently store some of the state that belongs to the outgoing requests and incoming responses on the disk for further usage. Before 3.1.0, HTTPie didn\u2018t distinguish between cookies and hosts they belonged. This behavior resulted in the exposure of some cookies when there are redirects originating from the actual host to a third party website. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-27630: An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the confctl_get_master_wlan functionality of TCL LinkHub Mesh Wi-Fi MS1G_00_01.00_14. A specially-crafted network packet can lead to information disclosure. An attacker can send packets to trigger this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2022-27633: An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the confctl_get_guest_wlan functionality of TCL LinkHub Mesh Wifi MS1G_00_01.00_14.

Starting with version 2.2 and prior to versions 2.3.9 and 2.4-beta-1, an attacker can circumvent access controls to obtain the content of public chat messages from different meetings on the server. The attacker must be a participant in a meeting on the server. BigBlueButton versions 2.3.9 and 2.4-beta-1 contain a patch for this issue. There are currently no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-31069: NestJS Proxy is a NestJS module to decorate and proxy calls. Prior to version 0.7.0, the nestjs-proxy library did not have a way to control when Authorization headers should should be forwarded for specific backend services configured by the application developer. This could have resulted in sensitive information such as OAuth bearer access tokens being inadvertently exposed to such services that should not see them. A new feature has been introduced in the patched version of nestjs-proxy that allows application developers to opt out of forwarding the Authorization headers on a per service basis using the `forwardToken` config setting. Developers are advised to review the README for this library on Github or NPM for further details on how this configuration can be applied. This issue has been fixed in version 0.7.0 of `@finastra/nestjs-proxy`. Users of `@ffdc/nestjs-proxy` are advised that this package has been deprecated and is no longer being maintained or receiving updates. Such users should update their package.json file to use `@finastra/nestjs-proxy` instead.\n\n- CVE-2022-31070: NestJS Proxy is a NestJS module to decorate and proxy calls. Prior to version 0.7.0, the nestjs-proxy library did not have a way to block sensitive cookies (e.g. session cookies) from being forwarded to backend services configured by the application developer. This could have led to sensitive cookies being inadvertently exposed to such services that should not see them. The patched version now blocks cookies from being forwarded by default. However developers can configure an allow-list of cookie names by using the `allowedCookies` config setting. This issue has been fixed in version 0.7.0 of `@finastra/nestjs-proxy`. Users of `@ffdc/nestjs-proxy` are advised that this package has been deprecated and is no longer being maintained or receiving updates. Such users should update their package.json file to use `@finastra/nestjs-proxy` instead.\n\n- CVE-2022-3348: Just like in the previous report, an attacker could steal the account of different users. But in this case, it's a little bit more specific, because it is needed to be an editor in the same app as the victim.\n\n- CVE-2022-38113: This vulnerability discloses build and services versions in the server response header. \n\n- CVE-2022-46150: Discourse is an open-source discussion platform. Prior to version 2.8.13 of the `stable` branch and version 2.9.0.beta14 of the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches, unauthorized users may learn of the existence of hidden tags and that they have been applied to topics that they have access to. This issue is patched in version 2.8.13 of the `stable` branch and version 2.9.0.beta14 of the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches. As a workaround, use the `disable_email` site setting to disable all emails to non-staff users.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-200 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-209 (CanAlsoBe)\n\n- CWE-202 (CanAlsoBe)",

An x86 PV guest can trigger a host OS crash when handling guest access to MSR_MISC_ENABLE. When a guest accesses certain Model Specific Registers, Xen first reads the value from hardware to use as the basis for auditing the guest access. For the MISC_ENABLE MSR, which is an Intel specific MSR, this MSR read is performed without error handling for a #GP fault, which is the consequence of trying to read this MSR on non-Intel hardware. A buggy or malicious PV guest administrator can crash Xen, resulting in a host Denial of Service. Only x86 systems are vulnerable. ARM systems are not vulnerable. Only Xen versions 4.11 and onwards are vulnerable. 4.10 and earlier are not vulnerable. Only x86 systems that do not implement the MISC_ENABLE MSR (0x1a0) are vulnerable. AMD and Hygon systems do not implement this MSR and are vulnerable. Intel systems do implement this MSR and are not vulnerable. Other manufacturers have not been checked.

Continued receipt and processing of the BGP update will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition. This issue affects very specific versions of Juniper Networks Junos OS: 19.3R3-S2; 19.4R3-S3; 20.2 versions 20.2R2-S3 and later, prior to 20.2R3-S2; 20.3 versions 20.3R2 and later, prior to 20.3R3; 20.4 versions 20.4R2 and later, prior to 20.4R3; 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R2. Juniper Networks Junos OS 20.1 is not affected by this issue. This issue also affects Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved: All versions prior to 20.4R2-S3-EVO, 20.4R3-EVO; 21.1-EVO versions prior to 21.1R2-EVO; 21.2-EVO versions prior to 21.2R2-EVO.\n\n- CVE-2021-33486: All versions of the CODESYS V3 Runtime Toolkit for VxWorks from version V3.5.8.0 and before version V3.5.17.10 have Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions.\n\n- CVE-2020-5403: Reactor Netty HttpServer, versions 0.9.3 and 0.9.4, is exposed to a URISyntaxException that causes the connection to be closed prematurely instead of producing a 400 response.\n\n- CVE-2020-25597: An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. There is mishandling of the constraint that once-valid event channels may not turn invalid. Logic in the handling of event channel operations in Xen assumes that an event channel, once valid, will not become invalid over the life time of a guest. However, operations like the resetting of all event channels may involve decreasing one of the bounds checked when determining validity. This may lead to bug checks triggering, crashing the host. An unprivileged guest may be able to crash Xen, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) for the entire system. All Xen versions from 4.4 onwards are vulnerable. Xen versions 4.3 and earlier are not vulnerable. Only systems with untrusted guests permitted to create more than the default number of event channels are vulnerable. This number depends on the architecture and type of guest. For 32-bit x86 PV guests, this is 1023; for 64-bit x86 PV guests, and for all ARM guests, this number is 4095. Systems where untrusted guests are limited to fewer than this number are not vulnerable. Note that xl and libxl limit max_event_channels to 1023 by default, so systems using exclusively xl, libvirt+libxl, or their own toolstack based on libxl, and not explicitly setting max_event_channels, are not vulnerable.\n\n- CVE-2020-7693: Incorrect handling of Upgrade header with the value websocket leads in crashing of containers hosting sockjs apps.

In versions 10.0 and priorm the implementation of URL-loading data sources like JSON, CSV, or Excel is vulnerable to advanced methods of Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). These vulnerabilities are only exploitable on installations where a URL-loading data source is enabled. As of time of publication, the `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches address this by applying the Advocate library for making http requests instead of the requests library directly. Users should upgrade to version 10.0.1 to receive this patch. There are a few workarounds for mitigating the vulnerability without upgrading. One can disable the vulnerable data sources entirely, by adding the following env variable to one's configuration, making them unavailable inside the webapp. One can switch any data source of certain types (viewable in the GitHub Security Advisory) to be `View Only` for all groups on the Settings > Groups > Data Sources screen. For users unable to update an admin may modify Redash's configuration through environment variables to mitigate this issue. Depending on the version of Redash, an admin may also need to run a CLI command to re-encrypt some fields in the database. The `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches as of time of publication have removed the default value for `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET`. All future releases will also require this to be set explicitly. For existing installations, one will need to ensure that explicit values are set for the `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET` and `REDASH_SECRET_KEY `variables.\n\n- CVE-2021-27561: Yealink Device Management (DM) 3.6.0.20 allows command injection as root via the /sm/api/v1/firewall/zone/services URI, without authentication.\n\n- CVE-2021-29475: HedgeDoc (formerly known as CodiMD) is an open-source collaborative markdown editor. An attacker is able to receive arbitrary files from the file system when exporting a note to PDF. Since the code injection has to take place as note content, there fore this exploit requires the attackers ability to modify a note. This will affect all instances, which have pdf export enabled. This issue has been fixed by https://github.com/hedgedoc/hedgedoc/commit/c1789474020a6d668d616464cb2da5e90e123f65 and is available in version 1.5.0. Starting the CodiMD/HedgeDoc instance with `CMD_ALLOW_PDF_EXPORT=false` or set `\"allowPDFExport\": false` in config.json can mitigate this issue for those who cannot upgrade. This exploit works because while PhantomJS doesn't actually render the `file:///` references to the PDF file itself, it still uses them internally, and exfiltration is possible, and easy through JavaScript rendering. The impact is pretty bad, as the attacker is able to read the CodiMD/HedgeDoc `config.json` file as well any other files on the filesystem. Even though the suggested Docker deploy option doesn't have many interesting files itself, the `config.json` still often contains sensitive information, database credentials, and maybe OAuth secrets among other things.\n\n- CVE-2021-45968: An issue was discovered in xmppserver jar in the XMPP Server component of the JIve platform, as used in Pascom Cloud Phone System before 7.20.x (and in other products).

In some cases an exploitation is possible by an unauthenticated user.\n\n- CVE-2022-1592: Server-Side Request Forgery in scout in GitHub repository clinical-genomics/scout prior to v4.42. An attacker could make the application perform arbitrary requests to fishing steal cookie, request to private area, or lead to xss...\n\n- CVE-2022-23544: MeterSphere is a one-stop open source continuous testing platform, covering test management, interface testing, UI testing and performance testing. Versions prior to 2.5.0 are subject to a Server-Side Request Forgery that leads to Cross-Site Scripting. A Server-Side request forgery in `IssueProxyResourceService::getMdImageByUrl` allows an attacker to access internal resources, as well as executing JavaScript code in the context of Metersphere's origin by a victim of a reflected XSS. This vulnerability has been fixed in v2.5.0. There are no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-41040: Microsoft Exchange Server Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2022-29180: A vulnerability in which attackers could forge HTTP requests to manipulate the `charm` data directory to access or delete anything on the server. This has been patched and is available in release [v0.12.1](https://github.com/charmbracelet/charm/releases/tag/v0.12.1). We recommend that all users running self-hosted `charm` instances update immediately. This vulnerability was found in-house and we haven't been notified of any potential exploiters. ### Additional notes * Encrypted user data uploaded to the Charm server is safe as Charm servers cannot decrypt user data. This includes filenames, paths, and all key-value data. * Users running the official Charm [Docker images](https://github.com/charmbracelet/charm/blob/main/docker.md) are at minimal risk because the exploit is limited to the containerized filesystem.\n\n- CVE-2022-29847: In Progress Ipswitch WhatsUp Gold 21.0.0 through 21.1.1, and 22.0.0, it is possible for an unauthenticated attacker to invoke an API transaction that would allow them to relay encrypted WhatsUp Gold user credentials to an arbitrary host.\n\n- CVE-2022-39055: RAVA certificate validation system has inadequate filtering for URL parameter.

In versions prior to 1.3.0 there exists a DoS vulnerability that is possible due to a bug in the library that would allow an attacker with specifically designed queries to cause stack overflow panics. Any user with access to the GraphQL handler can send these queries and cause stack overflows. This in turn could potentially compromise the ability of the server to serve data to its users. The issue has been patched in version `v1.3.0`. The only known workaround for this issue is to disable the `graphql.MaxDepth` option from your schema which is not recommended.\n\n- CVE-2022-23591: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The `GraphDef` format in TensorFlow does not allow self recursive functions. The runtime assumes that this invariant is satisfied. However, a `GraphDef` containing a fragment such as the following can be consumed when loading a `SavedModel`. This would result in a stack overflow during execution as resolving each `NodeDef` means resolving the function itself and its nodes. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2022-24675: encoding/pem in Go before 1.17.9 and 1.18.x before 1.18.1 has a Decode stack overflow via a large amount of PEM data.\n\n- CVE-2022-31019: Vapor is a server-side Swift HTTP web framework. When using automatic content decoding an attacker can craft a request body that can make the server crash with the following request: `curl -d \"array[_0][0][array][_0][0][array]$(for f in $(seq 1100); do echo -n '[_0][0][array]'; done)[string][_0]=hello%20world\" http://localhost:8080/foo`. The issue is unbounded, attacker controlled stack growth which will at some point lead to a stack overflow and a process crash. This issue has been fixed in version 4.61.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-31099: rulex is a new, portable, regular expression language. When parsing untrusted rulex expressions, the stack may overflow, possibly enabling a Denial of Service attack. This happens when parsing an expression with several hundred levels of nesting, causing the process to abort immediately. This is a security concern for you, if your service parses untrusted rulex expressions (expressions provided by an untrusted user), and your service becomes unavailable when the process running rulex aborts due to a stack overflow. The crash is fixed in version **0.4.3**. Affected users are advised to update to this version. There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-3216: A vulnerability has been found in Nintendo Game Boy Color and classified as problematic. This vulnerability affects unknown code of the component Mobile Adapter GB. The manipulation leads to memory corruption. The attack can be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. VDB-208606 is the identifier assigned to this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2022-38334: XPDF v4.04 and earlier was discovered to contain a stack overflow via the function Catalog::countPageTree() at Catalog.cc.\n\n- CVE-2022-41966: XStream serializes Java objects to XML and back again. Versions prior to 1.4.20 may allow a remote attacker to terminate the application with a stack overflow error, resulting in a denial of service only via manipulation the processed input stream. The attack uses the hash code implementation for collections and maps to force recursive hash calculation causing a stack overflow. This issue is patched in version 1.4.20 which handles the stack overflow and raises an InputManipulationException instead. A potential workaround for users who only use HashMap or HashSet and whose XML refers these only as default map or set, is to change the default implementation of java.util.Map and java.util per the code example in the referenced advisory. However, this implies that your application does not care about the implementation of the map and all elements are comparable.\n\n- CVE-2022-47662: GPAC MP4Box 2.1-DEV-rev649-ga8f438d20 has a segment fault (/stack overflow) due to infinite recursion in Media_GetSample isomedia/media.c:662\n\n- CVE-2022-23460: Jsonxx or Json++ is a JSON parser, writer and reader written in C++. In affected versions of jsonxx json parsing may lead to stack exhaustion in an address sanitized (ASAN) build. This issue may lead to Denial of Service if the program using the jsonxx library crashes. This issue exists on the current commit of the jsonxx project and the project itself has been archived. Updates are not expected. Users are advised to find a replacement.\n\n- CVE-2022-23606: Envoy is an open source edge and service proxy, designed for cloud-native applications. When a cluster is deleted via Cluster Discovery Service (CDS) all idle connections established to endpoints in that cluster are disconnected. A recursion was introduced in the procedure of disconnecting idle connections that can lead to stack exhaustion and abnormal process termination when a cluster has a large number of idle connections. This infinite recursion causes Envoy to crash. Users are advised to upgrade.\n\n- CVE-2022-24921: regexp.Compile in Go before 1.16.15 and 1.17.x before 1.17.8 allows stack exhaustion via a deeply nested expression.\n\n- CVE-2022-25313: In Expat (aka libexpat) before 2.4.5, an attacker can trigger stack exhaustion in build_model via a large nesting depth in the DTD element.\n\n- CVE-2022-27810: It was possible to trigger an infinite recursion condition in the error handler when Hermes executed specific maliciously formed JavaScript.

The syntax could be for data exchange formats, markup languages, or even programming languages. When untrusted input is not properly validated for the expected syntax, attackers could cause parsing failures, trigger unexpected errors, or expose latent vulnerabilities that might not be directly exploitable if the input had conformed to the syntax.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2016-4029: Chain: incorrect validation of intended decimal-based IP address format (CWE-1286) enables parsing of octal or hexadecimal formats (CWE-1389), allowing bypass of an SSRF protection mechanism (CWE-918).\n\n- CVE-2007-5893: HTTP request with missing protocol version number leads to crash\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-33195: Go before 1.15.13 and 1.16.x before 1.16.5 has functions for DNS lookups that do not validate replies from DNS servers, and thus a return value may contain an unsafe injection (e.g., XSS) that does not conform to the RFC1035 format.\n\n- CVE-2021-21705: In PHP versions 7.3.x below 7.3.29, 7.4.x below 7.4.21 and 8.0.x below 8.0.8, when using URL validation functionality via filter_var() function with FILTER_VALIDATE_URL parameter, an URL with invalid password field can be accepted as valid. This can lead to the code incorrectly parsing the URL and potentially leading to other security implications - like contacting a wrong server or making a wrong access decision.\n\n- CVE-2021-23853: In Bosch IP cameras, improper validation of the HTTP header allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTTP headers through crafted URLs.\n\n- CVE-2021-25465: An improper scheme check vulnerability in Samsung Themes prior to version 5.2.01 allows attackers to perform Man-in-the-middle attack.\n\n- CVE-2021-29418: The netmask package before 2.0.1 for Node.js mishandles certain unexpected characters in an IP address string, such as an octal digit of 9. This (in some situations) allows attackers to bypass access control that is based on IP addresses. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2021-28918.\n\n- CVE-2021-45223: An issue was discovered in COINS Construction Cloud 11.12. Due to insufficient input neutralization, it is vulnerable to denial of service attacks via forced server crashes.\n\n- CVE-2021-45687: An issue was discovered in the raw-cpuid crate before 9.1.1 for Rust. If the serialize feature is used (which is not the the default), a Deserialize operation may lack sufficient validation, leading to memory corruption or a panic.\n\n- CVE-2022-22176: An Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input vulnerability in the Juniper DHCP daemon (jdhcpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an adjacent unauthenticated attacker sending a malformed DHCP packet to cause a crash of jdhcpd and thereby a Denial of Service (DoS). If option-82 is configured in a DHCP snooping / -security scenario, jdhcpd crashes if a specific malformed DHCP request packet is received. The DHCP functionality is impacted while jdhcpd restarts, and continued exploitation of the vulnerability will lead to the unavailability of the DHCP service and thereby a sustained DoS. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS 13.2 version 13.2R1 and later versions prior to 15.1R7-S11; 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R3-S6; 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R2-S9, 18.4R3-S10; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R2-S3, 19.1R3-S7; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S8, 19.2R3-S4; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R2-S7, 19.3R3-S4; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R3-S6; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R3-S3; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R3-S3; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R3-S1; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R3; 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R2-S1, 21.1R3; 21.2 versions prior to 21.2R1-S1, 21.2R2. This issue does not affect Juniper Networks Junos OS version 12.3R12 and prior versions.\n\n- CVE-2022-22192: An Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input vulnerability in the kernel of Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved on PTX series allows a network-based, unauthenticated attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS). When an incoming TCP packet destined to the device is malformed there is a possibility of a kernel panic. Only TCP packets destined to the ports for BGP, LDP and MSDP can trigger this. This issue only affects PTX10004, PTX10008, PTX10016. No other PTX Series devices or other platforms are affected. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved: 20.4-EVO versions prior to 20.4R3-S4-EVO; 21.3-EVO versions prior to 21.3R3-EVO; 21.4-EVO versions prior to 21.4R3-EVO; 22.1-EVO versions prior to 22.1R2-EVO. This issue does not affect Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved versions prior to 20.4R1-EVO.\n\n- CVE-2022-45113: Improper validation of syntactic correctness of input vulnerability exist in Movable Type series.

            "extended_description": "\n\nCross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:\n\n\n  1. Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.\n\n  1. The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.\n\n  1. During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.\n\n  1. A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.\n\n  1. Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.\n\n  1. This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.\n\nThere are three main kinds of XSS:\n\n  -  **Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent)**  - The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.\n\n  -  **Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent)**  - The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs. \n\n  -  **Type 0: DOM-Based XSS**  - In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible. \n\nOnce the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"\n\nIn many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.\n",

The key would typically identify a user-related record stored in the system and would be used to lookup that record for presentation to the user. It is likely that an attacker would have to be an authenticated user in the system. However, the authorization process would not properly check the data access operation to ensure that the authenticated user performing the operation has sufficient entitlements to perform the requested data access, hence bypassing any other authorization checks present in the system.\n\n\nFor example, attackers can look at places where user specific data is retrieved (e.g. search screens) and determine whether the key for the item being looked up is controllable externally. The key may be a hidden field in the HTML form field, might be passed as a URL parameter or as an unencrypted cookie variable, then in each of these cases it will be possible to tamper with the key value.\n\n\nOne manifestation of this weakness is when a system uses sequential or otherwise easily-guessable session IDs that would allow one user to easily switch to another user's session and read/modify their data.\n",

              "extended_description": "\n\nCross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:\n\n\n  1. Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.\n\n  1. The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.\n\n  1. During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.\n\n  1. A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.\n\n  1. Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.\n\n  1. This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.\n\nThere are three main kinds of XSS:\n\n  -  **Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent)**  - The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.\n\n  -  **Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent)**  - The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs. \n\n  -  **Type 0: DOM-Based XSS**  - In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible. \n\nOnce the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"\n\nIn many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.\n",

The key would typically identify a user-related record stored in the system and would be used to lookup that record for presentation to the user. It is likely that an attacker would have to be an authenticated user in the system. However, the authorization process would not properly check the data access operation to ensure that the authenticated user performing the operation has sufficient entitlements to perform the requested data access, hence bypassing any other authorization checks present in the system.\n\n\nFor example, attackers can look at places where user specific data is retrieved (e.g. search screens) and determine whether the key for the item being looked up is controllable externally. The key may be a hidden field in the HTML form field, might be passed as a URL parameter or as an unencrypted cookie variable, then in each of these cases it will be possible to tamper with the key value.\n\n\nOne manifestation of this weakness is when a system uses sequential or otherwise easily-guessable session IDs that would allow one user to easily switch to another user's session and read/modify their data.\n",

However, including unexpected data in an HTTP header allows an attacker to specify the entirety of the HTTP message that is rendered by the client HTTP agent (e.g., web browser) or back-end HTTP agent (e.g., web server), whether the message is part of a request or a response. \n\n\nWhen an HTTP request contains unexpected CR and LF characters, the server may respond with an output stream that is interpreted as \"splitting\" the stream into two different HTTP messages instead of one. CR is carriage return, also given by %0d or \\r, and LF is line feed, also given by %0a or \\n.\n\n\nIn addition to CR and LF characters, other valid/RFC compliant special characters and unique character encodings can be utilized, such as HT (horizontal tab, also given by %09 or \\t) and SP (space, also given as + sign or %20).\n\n\nThese types of unvalidated and unexpected data in HTTP message headers allow an attacker to control the second \"split\" message to mount attacks such as server-side request forgery, cross-site scripting, and cache poisoning attacks.\n\n\nHTTP response splitting weaknesses may be present when:\n\n\n  1. Data enters a web application through an untrusted source, most frequently an HTTP request.\n\n  1. The data is included in an HTTP response header sent to a web user without neutralizing malicious characters that can be interpreted as separator characters for headers.\n\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-15811: Chain: Proxy uses a substring search instead of parsing the Transfer-Encoding header (CWE-697), allowing request splitting (CWE-113) and cache poisoning\n\n- CVE-2021-41084: Scala-based HTTP interface allows request splitting and response splitting through header names, header values, status reasons, and URIs\n\n- CVE-2018-12116: Javascript-based framework allows request splitting through a path option of an HTTP request\n\n- CVE-2004-2146: Application accepts CRLF in an object ID, allowing HTTP response splitting.\n\n- CVE-2004-1656: Shopping cart allows HTTP response splitting to perform HTML injection via CRLF in a parameter for a url\n\n- CVE-2005-2060: Bulletin board allows response splitting via CRLF in parameter.\n\n- CVE-2004-2512: Response splitting via CRLF in PHPSESSID.\n\n- CVE-2005-1951: e-commerce app allows HTTP response splitting using CRLF in object id parameters\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-0268: An Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Response Splitting') weakness in J-web of Juniper Networks Junos OS leads to buffer overflows, segment faults, or other impacts, which allows an attacker to modify the integrity of the device and exfiltration information from the device without authentication. The weakness can be exploited to facilitate cross-site scripting (XSS), cookie manipulation (modifying session cookies, stealing cookies) and more. This weakness can also be exploited by directing a user to a seemingly legitimate link from the affected site. The attacker requires no special access or permissions to the device to carry out such attacks. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS: 18.1 versions prior to 18.1R3-S11; 18.2 versions prior to 18.2R3-S5; 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R2-S4, 18.3R3-S3; 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R2-S5, 18.4R3-S3; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R2-S2, 19.1R3-S2; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S5, 19.2R2; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R3; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R1-S3, 19.4R2, 19.4R3; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R1-S2, 20.1R2. This issue does not affect Juniper Networks Junos OS versions prior to 18.1R1.\n\n- CVE-2021-28979: SafeNet KeySecure Management Console 8.12.0 is vulnerable to HTTP response splitting attacks. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using specially-crafted URL to cause the server to return a split response, once the URL is clicked.\n\n- CVE-2021-41084: http4s is an open source scala interface for HTTP. In affected versions http4s is vulnerable to response-splitting or request-splitting attacks when untrusted user input is used to create any of the following fields: Header names (`Header.name`\u00e5), Header values (`Header.value`), Status reason phrases (`Status.reason`), URI paths (`Uri.Path`), URI authority registered names (`URI.RegName`) (through 0.21). This issue has been resolved in versions 0.21.30, 0.22.5, 0.23.4, and 1.0.0-M27 perform the following. As a matter of practice http4s services and client applications should sanitize any user input in the aforementioned fields before returning a request or response to the backend. The carriage return, newline, and null characters are the most threatening.\n\n- CVE-2021-45818: SAFARI Montage 8.7.32 is affected by a CRLF injection vulnerability which can lead to HTTP response splitting.\n\n- CVE-2021-33621: The cgi gem before 0.1.0.2, 0.2.x before 0.2.2, and 0.3.x before 0.3.5 for Ruby allows HTTP response splitting. This is relevant to applications that use untrusted user input either to generate an HTTP response or to create a CGI::Cookie object.\n\n- CVE-2021-40336: A vulnerability exists in the http web interface where the web interface does not validate data in an HTTP header. This causes a possible HTTP response splitting, which if exploited could lead an attacker to channel down harmful code into the user\u2019s web browser, such as to steal the session cookies. Thus, an attacker who successfully makes an MSM user who has already established a session to MSM web interface clicks a forged link to the MSM web interface, e.g., the link is sent per E-Mail, could trick the user into downloading malicious software onto his computer. This issue affects: Hitachi Energy MSM V2.2 and prior versions.\n\n- CVE-2021-41437: An HTTP response splitting attack in web application in ASUS RT-AX88U before v3.0.0.4.388.20558 allows an attacker to craft a specific URL that if an authenticated victim visits it, the URL will give access to the cloud storage of the attacker.\n\n- CVE-2022-20772: A vulnerability in Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA) and Cisco Secure Email and Web Manager could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct an HTTP response splitting attack. This vulnerability is due to the failure of the application or its environment to properly sanitize input values. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious HTTP headers, controlling the response body, or splitting the response into multiple responses.\n\n- CVE-2022-35507: A response-header CRLF injection vulnerability in the Proxmox Virtual Environment (PVE) and Proxmox Mail Gateway (PMG) web interface allows a remote attacker to set cookies for a victim's browser that are longer than the server expects, causing a client-side DoS. This affects Chromium-based browsers because they allow injection of response headers with %0d. This is fixed in pve-http-server 4.1-3.\n\n- CVE-2022-37240: MDaemon Technologies SecurityGateway for Email Servers 8.5.2 is vulnerable to HTTP Response splitting via the format parameter.\n\n- CVE-2022-37242: MDaemon Technologies SecurityGateway for Email Servers 8.5.2, is vulnerable to HTTP Response splitting via the data parameter.\n\n- CVE-2022-37953: An HTTP response splitting vulnerability exists in the AM Gateway Challenge-Response dialog of WorkstationST (<v07.09.15) and could allow an attacker to compromise a victim's browser/session. WorkstationST is only deployed in specific, controlled environments rendering attack complexity significantly higher than if the attack were conducted on the software in isolation. WorkstationST v07.09.15 can be found in ControlST v07.09.07 SP8 and greater.\n\n- CVE-2022-42471: An improper neutralization of CRLF sequences in HTTP headers ('HTTP Response Splitting') vulnerability [CWE-113] In FortiWeb version 7.0.0 through 7.0.2, FortiWeb version 6.4.0 through 6.4.2, FortiWeb version 6.3.6 through 6.3.20 may allow an authenticated and remote attacker to inject arbitrary headers.\n\n- CVE-2022-42472: A improper neutralization of crlf sequences in http headers ('http response splitting') in Fortinet FortiOS versions 7.2.0 through 7.2.2, 7.0.0 through 7.0.8, 6.4.0 through 6.4.11, 6.2.0 through 6.2.12, 6.0.0 through 6.0.16, FortiProxy 7.2.0 through 7.2.1, 7.0.0 through 7.0.7, 2.0.0 through 2.0.10, 1.2.0 through 1.2.13, 1.1.0 through 1.1.6 may allow an authenticated and remote attacker to perform an HTTP request splitting attack which gives attackers control of the remaining headers and body of the response.\n\n- CVE-2022-47052: The web interface of the 'Nighthawk R6220 AC1200 Smart Wi-Fi Router' is vulnerable to a CRLF Injection attack that can be leveraged to perform Reflected XSS and HTML Injection. A malicious unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability using a specially crafted URL. This affects firmware versions: V1.1.0.112_1.0.1, V1.1.0.114_1.0.1.\n\n- CVE-2021-37499: CRLF vulnerability in Reprise License Manager (RLM) web interface through 14.2BL4 in the password parameter in View License Result function, that allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary HTTP headers.\n\n- CVE-2022-32453: HTTP header injection vulnerability in Cybozu Office 10.0.0 to 10.8.5 may allow a remote attacker to obtain and/or alter the data of the product via unspecified vectors.\n\n- CVE-2022-3918: A program using FoundationNetworking in swift-corelibs-foundation is potentially vulnerable to CRLF ( ) injection in URLRequest headers. In this vulnerability, a client can insert one or several CRLF sequences into a URLRequest header value. When that request is sent via URLSession to an HTTP server, the server may interpret the content after the CRLF as extra headers, or even a second request. For example, consider a URLRequest to http://example.com/ with the GET method. Suppose we set the URLRequest header \"Foo\" to the value \"Bar Extra-Header: Added GET /other HTTP/1.1\". When this request is sent, it will appear to the server as two requests: GET / HTTP/1.1 Foo: Bar Extra-Header: Added GET /other HTTP/1.1 In this manner, the client is able to inject extra headers and craft an entirely new request to a separate path, despite only making one API call in URLSession. If a developer has total control over the request and its headers, this vulnerability may not pose a threat. However, this vulnerability escalates if un-sanitized user input is placed in header values. If so, a malicious user could inject new headers or requests to an intermediary or backend server. Developers should be especially careful to sanitize user input in this case, or upgrade their version of swift-corelibs-foundation to include the patch below.\n\n- CVE-2022-4188: Insufficient validation of untrusted input in CORS in Google Chrome on Android prior to 108.0.5359.71 allowed a remote attacker to bypass same origin policy via a crafted HTML page.

If an attacker can trigger the allocation of these limited resources, but the number or size of the resources is not controlled, then the attacker could cause a denial of service that consumes all available resources. This would prevent valid users from accessing the product, and it could potentially have an impact on the surrounding environment. For example, a memory exhaustion attack against an application could slow down the application as well as its host operating system.\n\n\nThere are at least three distinct scenarios which can commonly lead to resource exhaustion:\n\n\n  - Lack of throttling for the number of allocated resources\n\n  - Losing all references to a resource before reaching the shutdown stage\n\n  - Not closing/returning a resource after processing\n\nResource exhaustion problems are often result due to an incorrect implementation of the following situations:\n\n  - Error conditions and other exceptional circumstances.\n\n  - Confusion over which part of the program is responsible for releasing the resource.\n\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-21668: Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).\n\n- CVE-2020-7218: Go-based workload orchestrator does not limit resource usage with unauthenticated connections, allowing a DoS by flooding the service\n\n- CVE-2020-3566: Resource exhaustion in distributed OS because of \"insufficient\" IGMP queue management, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2009-2874: Product allows attackers to cause a crash via a large number of connections.\n\n- CVE-2009-1928: Malformed request triggers uncontrolled recursion, leading to stack exhaustion.\n\n- CVE-2009-2858: Chain: memory leak (CWE-404) leads to resource exhaustion.\n\n- CVE-2009-2726: Driver does not use a maximum width when invoking sscanf style functions, causing stack consumption.\n\n- CVE-2009-2540: Large integer value for a length property in an object causes a large amount of memory allocation.\n\n- CVE-2009-2299: Web application firewall consumes excessive memory when an HTTP request contains a large Content-Length value but no POST data.\n\n- CVE-2009-2054: Product allows exhaustion of file descriptors when processing a large number of TCP packets.\n\n- CVE-2008-5180: Communication product allows memory consumption with a large number of SIP requests, which cause many sessions to be created.\n\n- CVE-2008-2121: TCP implementation allows attackers to consume CPU and prevent new connections using a TCP SYN flood attack.\n\n- CVE-2008-2122: Port scan triggers CPU consumption with processes that attempt to read data from closed sockets.\n\n- CVE-2008-1700: Product allows attackers to cause a denial of service via a large number of directives, each of which opens a separate window.\n\n- CVE-2007-4103: Product allows resource exhaustion via a large number of calls that do not complete a 3-way handshake.\n\n- CVE-2006-1173: Mail server does not properly handle deeply nested multipart MIME messages, leading to stack exhaustion.\n\n- CVE-2007-0897: Chain: anti-virus product encounters a malformed file but returns from a function without closing a file descriptor (CWE-775) leading to file descriptor consumption (CWE-400) and failed scans.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-22101: Cloud Controller versions prior to 1.118.0 are vulnerable to unauthenticated denial of Service(DoS) vulnerability allowing unauthenticated attackers to cause denial of service by using REST HTTP requests with label_selectors on multiple V3 endpoints by generating an enormous SQL query.\n\n- CVE-2021-1266: A vulnerability in the REST API of Cisco Managed Services Accelerator (MSX) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to the way that the affected software logs certain API requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a flood of crafted API requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition on the affected device.\n\n- CVE-2021-1312: A vulnerability in the system resource management of Cisco Elastic Services Controller (ESC) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) to the health monitor API on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to inadequate provisioning of kernel parameters for the maximum number of TCP connections and SYN backlog. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a flood of crafted TCP packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to block TCP listening ports that are used by the health monitor API. This vulnerability only affects customers who use the health monitor API.\n\n- CVE-2021-1378: A vulnerability in the SSH service of the Cisco StarOS operating system could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to stop processing traffic, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to a logic error that may occur under specific traffic conditions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of crafted packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to prevent the targeted service from receiving any traffic, which would lead to a DoS condition on the affected device.\n\n- CVE-2021-1489: A vulnerability in filesystem usage management for Cisco Firepower Device Manager (FDM) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to exhaust filesystem resources, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to the insufficient management of available filesystem resources. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading files to the device and exhausting available filesystem resources. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause database errors and cause the device to become unresponsive to web-based management. Manual intervention is required to free filesystem resources and return the device to an operational state.\n\n- CVE-2021-1460: A vulnerability in the Cisco IOx Application Framework of Cisco 809 Industrial Integrated Services Routers (Industrial ISRs), Cisco 829 Industrial ISRs, Cisco CGR 1000 Compute Module, and Cisco IC3000 Industrial Compute Gateway could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient error handling during packet processing. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a high and sustained rate of crafted TCP traffic to the IOx web server on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the IOx web server to stop processing requests, resulting in a DoS condition.\n\n- CVE-2021-0285: An uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability in Juniper Networks Junos OS on QFX5000 Series and EX4600 Series switches allows an attacker sending large amounts of legitimate traffic destined to the device to cause Interchassis Control Protocol (ICCP) interruptions, leading to an unstable control connection between the Multi-Chassis Link Aggregation Group (MC-LAG) nodes which can in turn lead to traffic loss.

A malicious user or attacker can send multiple requests initiating the Authorization Request for the Authorization Code Grant, which has the potential of exhausting system resources using a single session or multiple sessions.\n\n- CVE-2021-43173: In NLnet Labs Routinator prior to 0.10.2, a validation run can be delayed significantly by an RRDP repository by not answering but slowly drip-feeding bytes to keep the connection alive. This can be used to effectively stall validation. While Routinator has a configurable time-out value for RRDP connections, this time-out was only applied to individual read or write operations rather than the complete request. Thus, if an RRDP repository sends a little bit of data before that time-out expired, it can continuously extend the time it takes for the request to finish. Since validation will only continue once the update of an RRDP repository has concluded, this delay will cause validation to stall, leading to Routinator continuing to serve the old data set or, if in the initial validation run directly after starting, never serve any data at all.\n\n- CVE-2020-12291: Uncontrolled resource consumption in some Intel(R) Thunderbolt(TM) controllers may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable denial of service via local access.\n\n- CVE-2020-12296: Uncontrolled resource consumption in some Intel(R) Thunderbolt(TM) controllers may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable denial of service via local access.\n\n- CVE-2020-1702: A malicious container image can consume an unbounded amount of memory when being pulled to a container runtime host, such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux using podman, or OpenShift Container Platform.

This would be an effective way to perform a denial-of-service attack. This has been resolved in version 3.1.0. The resolution is to limit the number of allowable transforms to 2.\n\n- CVE-2021-21271: Tendermint Core is an open source Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) middleware that takes a state transition machine - written in any programming language - and securely replicates it on many machines. Tendermint Core v0.34.0 introduced a new way of handling evidence of misbehavior. As part of this, we added a new Timestamp field to Evidence structs. This timestamp would be calculated using the same algorithm that is used when a block is created and proposed. (This algorithm relies on the timestamp of the last commit from this specific block.) In Tendermint Core v0.34.0-v0.34.2, the consensus reactor is responsible for forming DuplicateVoteEvidence whenever double signs are observed. However, the current block is still \u201cin flight\u201d when it is being formed by the consensus reactor. It hasn\u2019t been finalized through network consensus yet. This means that different nodes in the network may observe different \u201clast commits\u201d when assigning a timestamp to DuplicateVoteEvidence. In turn, different nodes could form DuplicateVoteEvidence objects at the same height but with different timestamps. One DuplicateVoteEvidence object (with one timestamp) will then eventually get finalized in the block, but this means that any DuplicateVoteEvidence with a different timestamp is considered invalid. Any node that formed invalid DuplicateVoteEvidence will continue to propose invalid evidence; its peers may see this, and choose to disconnect from this node. This bug means that double signs are DoS vectors in Tendermint Core v0.34.0-v0.34.2. Tendermint Core v0.34.3 is a security release which fixes this bug. As of v0.34.3, DuplicateVoteEvidence is no longer formed by the consensus reactor; rather, the consensus reactor passes the Votes themselves into the EvidencePool, which is now responsible for forming DuplicateVoteEvidence. The EvidencePool has timestamp info that should be consistent across the network, which means that DuplicateVoteEvidence formed in this reactor should have consistent timestamps. This release changes the API between the consensus and evidence reactors.\n\n- CVE-2021-21328: Vapor is a web framework for Swift. In Vapor before version 4.40.1, there is a DoS attack against anyone who Bootstraps a metrics backend for their Vapor app. The following is the attack vector: 1. send unlimited requests against a vapor instance with different paths. this will create unlimited counters and timers, which will eventually drain the system. 2. downstream services might suffer from this attack as well by being spammed with error paths. This has been patched in 4.40.1. The `DefaultResponder` will rewrite any undefined route paths for to `vapor_route_undefined` to avoid unlimited counters.\n\n- CVE-2021-21369: Hyperledger Besu is an open-source, MainNet compatible, Ethereum client written in Java. In Besu before version 1.5.1 there is a denial-of-service vulnerability involving the HTTP JSON-RPC API service. If username and password authentication is enabled for the HTTP JSON-RPC API service, then prior to making any requests to an API endpoint the requestor must use the login endpoint to obtain a JSON web token (JWT) using their credentials. A single user can readily overload the login endpoint with invalid requests (incorrect password). As the supplied password is checked for validity on the main vertx event loop and takes a relatively long time this can cause the processing of other valid requests to fail. A valid username is required for this vulnerability to be exposed. This has been fixed in version 1.5.1.\n\n- CVE-2021-21529: Dell System Update (DSU) 1.9 and earlier versions contain a denial of service vulnerability.

Existing connections are not affected.\n\n- CVE-2022-31006: indy-node is the server portion of Hyperledger Indy, a distributed ledger purpose-built for decentralized identity. In vulnerable versions of indy-node, an attacker can max out the number of client connections allowed by the ledger, leaving the ledger unable to be used for its intended purpose. However, the ledger content will not be impacted and the ledger will resume functioning after the attack. This attack exploits the trade-off between resilience and availability. Any protection against abusive client connections will also prevent the network being accessed by certain legitimate users. As a result, validator nodes must tune their firewall rules to ensure the right trade-off for their network's expected users. The guidance to network operators for the use of firewall rules in the deployment of Indy networks has been modified to better protect against denial of service attacks by increasing the cost and complexity in mounting such attacks. The mitigation for this vulnerability is not in the Hyperledger Indy code per se, but rather in the individual deployments of Indy. The mitigations should be applied to all deployments of Indy, and are not related to a particular release.\n\n- CVE-2022-31030: containerd is an open source container runtime. A bug was found in the containerd's CRI implementation where programs inside a container can cause the containerd daemon to consume memory without bound during invocation of the `ExecSync` API. This can cause containerd to consume all available memory on the computer, denying service to other legitimate workloads. Kubernetes and crictl can both be configured to use containerd's CRI implementation; `ExecSync` may be used when running probes or when executing processes via an \"exec\" facility. This bug has been fixed in containerd 1.6.6 and 1.5.13. Users should update to these versions to resolve the issue. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that only trusted images and commands are used.\n\n- CVE-2022-31073: KubeEdge is an open source system for extending native containerized application orchestration capabilities to hosts at Edge. Prior to versions 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4, the ServiceBus server on the edge side may be susceptible to a DoS attack if an HTTP request containing a very large Body is sent to it. It is possible for the node to be exhausted of memory. The consequence of the exhaustion is that other services on the node, e.g. other containers, will be unable to allocate memory and thus causing a denial of service. Malicious apps accidentally pulled by users on the host and have the access to send HTTP requests to localhost may make an attack. It will be affected only when users enable the `ServiceBus` module in the config file `edgecore.yaml`. This bug has been fixed in Kubeedge 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4. As a workaround, disable the `ServiceBus` module in the config file `edgecore.yaml`.\n\n- CVE-2022-31074: KubeEdge is an open source system for extending native containerized application orchestration capabilities to hosts at Edge. Prior to versions 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4, several endpoints in the Cloud AdmissionController may be susceptible to a DoS attack if an HTTP request containing a very large Body is sent to it. The consequence of the exhaustion is that the Cloud AdmissionController will be in denial of service. This bug has been fixed in Kubeedge 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4. There is currently no known workaround.\n\n- CVE-2022-3283: A potential DOS vulnerability was discovered in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions before before 15.2.5, all versions starting from 15.3 before 15.3.4, all versions starting from 15.4 before 15.4.1 While cloning an issue with special crafted content added to the description could have been used to trigger high CPU usage.\n\n- CVE-2022-33203: In BIG-IP Versions 16.1.x before 16.1.3, 15.1.x before 15.1.6.1, and 14.1.x before 14.1.5, when a BIG-IP APM access policy with Service Connect agent is configured on a virtual server, undisclosed requests can cause an increase in memory resource utilization.

Improper data handling on branch creation could have been used to trigger high CPU usage.\n\n- CVE-2022-3818: An uncontrolled resource consumption issue when parsing URLs in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions prior to 15.3.5, 15.4 prior to 15.4.4, and 15.5 prior to 15.5.2 allows an attacker to cause performance issues and potentially a denial of service on the GitLab instance.\n\n- CVE-2022-39278: Istio is an open platform-independent service mesh that provides traffic management, policy enforcement, and telemetry collection. Prior to versions 1.15.2, 1.14.5, and 1.13.9, the Istio control plane, istiod, is vulnerable to a request processing error, allowing a malicious attacker that sends a specially crafted or oversized message which results in the control plane crashing when the Kubernetes validating or mutating webhook service is exposed publicly. This endpoint is served over TLS port 15017, but does not require any authentication from the attacker. For simple installations, Istiod is typically only reachable from within the cluster, limiting the blast radius. However, for some deployments, especially external istiod topologies, this port is exposed over the public internet. Versions 1.15.2, 1.14.5, and 1.13.9 contain patches for this issue. There are no effective workarounds, beyond upgrading. This bug is due to an error in `regexp.Compile` in Go.\n\n- CVE-2022-39330: Nextcloud Server is the file server software for Nextcloud, a self-hosted productivity platform. Nextcloud Server prior to versions 23.0.10 and 24.0.6 and Nextcloud Enterprise Server prior to versions 22.2.10, 23.0.10, and 24.0.6 are vulnerable to a logged-in attacker slowing down the system by generating a lot of database/cpu load. Nextcloud Server versions 23.0.10 and 24.0.6 and Nextcloud Enterprise Server versions 22.2.10, 23.0.10, and 24.0.6 contain patches for this issue. As a workaround, disable the Circles app.\n\n- CVE-2022-40735: The Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement Protocol allows use of long exponents that arguably make certain calculations unnecessarily expensive, because the 1996 van Oorschot and Wiener paper found that \"(appropriately) short exponents\" can be used when there are adequate subgroup constraints, and these short exponents can lead to less expensive calculations than for long exponents. This issue is different from CVE-2002-20001 because it is based on an observation about exponent size, rather than an observation about numbers that are not public keys. The specific situations in which calculation expense would constitute a server-side vulnerability depend on the protocol (e.g., TLS, SSH, or IKE) and the DHE implementation details. In general, there might be an availability concern because of server-side resource consumption from DHE modular-exponentiation calculations. Finally, it is possible for an attacker to exploit this vulnerability and CVE-2002-20001 together.\n\n- CVE-2022-41770: In BIG-IP versions 17.0.x before 17.0.0.1, 16.1.x before 16.1.3.1, 15.1.x before 15.1.7, 14.1.x before 14.1.5.1, and all versions of 13.1.x, and BIG-IQ all versions of 8.x and 7.x, an authenticated iControl REST user can cause an increase in memory resource utilization, via undisclosed requests.\n\n- CVE-2022-41806: In versions 16.1.x before 16.1.3.2 and 15.1.x before 15.1.5.1, when BIG-IP AFM Network Address Translation policy with IPv6/IPv4 translation rules is configured on a virtual server, undisclosed requests can cause an increase in memory resource utilization.\n\n- CVE-2022-41833: In all BIG-IP 13.1.x versions, when an iRule containing the HTTP::collect command is configured on a virtual server, undisclosed requests can cause Traffic Management Microkernel (TMM) to terminate.\n\n- CVE-2022-4344: Memory exhaustion in the Kafka protocol dissector in Wireshark 4.0.0 to 4.0.1 and 3.6.0 to 3.6.9 allows denial of service via packet injection or crafted capture file\n\n- CVE-2022-20692: A vulnerability in the NETCONF over SSH feature of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow a low-privileged, authenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service condition (DoS) on an affected device.

The device sends unnecessary information to the cloud controller server. Although this information is sent encrypted and has low risk in isolation, it decreases the privacy of the end user. The information sent includes the local IP address being used and the SSID of the Wi-Fi network the device is connected to. (Various resources such as wigle.net can be use for mapping of SSIDs to physical locations.)\n\n- CVE-2021-24170: The REST API endpoint get_users in the User Profile Picture WordPress plugin before 2.5.0 returned more information than was required for its functionality to users with the upload_files capability. This included password hashes, hashed user activation keys, usernames, emails, and other less sensitive information.\n\n- CVE-2021-24585: The Timetable and Event Schedule WordPress plugin before 2.4.0 outputs the Hashed Password, Username and Email Address (along other less sensitive data) of the user related to the Even Head of the Timeslot in the response when requesting the event Timeslot data with a user with the edit_posts capability. Combined with the other Unauthorised Event Timeslot Modification issue (https://wpscan.com/reports/submissions/4699/) where an arbitrary user ID can be set, this could allow low privilege users with the edit_posts capability (such as author) to retrieve sensitive User data by iterating over the user_id\n\n- CVE-2021-26566: Insertion of sensitive information into sent data vulnerability in synorelayd in Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM) before 6.2.3-25426-3 allows man-in-the-middle attackers to execute arbitrary commands via inbound QuickConnect traffic.\n\n- CVE-2021-22172: Improper authorization in GitLab 12.8+ allows a guest user in a private project to view tag data that should be inaccessible on the releases page\n\n- CVE-2021-26923: An issue was discovered in Argo CD before 1.8.4.

A compromised pod with sufficient privilege is able to reconfigure the node\u2019s IPv6 interface due to the node accepting route advertisement by default, allowing the attacker to redirect full or partial network traffic from the node to the compromised pod.\n\n- CVE-2020-14371: A credential leak vulnerability was found in Red Hat Satellite. This flaw exposes the compute resources credentials through VMs that are running on these resources in Satellite.\n\n- CVE-2021-20228: A flaw was found in the Ansible Engine 2.9.18, where sensitive info is not masked by default and is not protected by the no_log feature when using the sub-option feature of the basic.py module. This flaw allows an attacker to obtain sensitive information. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality.\n\n- CVE-2021-20331:  Specific versions of the MongoDB C# Driver may erroneously publish events containing authentication-related data to a command listener configured by an application. The published events may contain security-sensitive data when commands such as \"saslStart\", \"saslContinue\", \"isMaster\", \"createUser\", and \"updateUser\" are executed. Without due care, an application may inadvertently expose this authenticated-related information, e.g., by writing it to a log file. This issue only arises if an application enables the command listener feature (this is not enabled by default). This issue affects the MongoDB C# Driver v2.12 versions prior to and including 2.12.1. \n\n- CVE-2021-26593: In Directus 8.x through 8.8.1, an attacker can see all users in the CMS using the API /users/{id}. For each call, they get in response a lot of information about the user (such as email address, first name, and last name) but also the secret for 2FA if one exists. This secret can be regenerated. NOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer\n\n- CVE-2021-28133: Zoom through 5.5.4 sometimes allows attackers to read private information on a participant's screen, even though the participant never attempted to share the private part of their screen. When a user shares a specific application window via the Share Screen functionality, other meeting participants can briefly see contents of other application windows that were explicitly not shared. The contents of these other windows can (for instance) be seen for a short period of time when they overlay the shared window and get into focus. (An attacker can, of course, use a separate screen-recorder application, unsupported by Zoom, to save all such contents for later replays and analysis.) Depending on the unintentionally shared data, this short exposure of screen contents may be a more or less severe security issue.\n\n- CVE-2021-29483: ManageWiki is an extension to the MediaWiki project. The 'wikiconfig' API leaked the value of private configuration variables set through the ManageWiki variable to all users. This has been patched by https://github.com/miraheze/ManageWiki/compare/99f3b2c8af18...befb83c66f5b.patch. If you are unable to patch set `$wgAPIListModules['wikiconfig'] = 'ApiQueryDisabled';` or remove private config as a workaround.\n\n- CVE-2021-31545: An issue was discovered in the AbuseFilter extension for MediaWiki through 1.35.2.

The Special:AbuseFilter/examine form allowed for the disclosure of suppressed MediaWiki usernames to unprivileged users.\n\n- CVE-2021-32747: Icinga Web 2 is an open source monitoring web interface, framework, and command-line interface. A vulnerability in which custom variables are exposed to unauthorized users exists between versions 2.0.0 and 2.8.2. Custom variables are user-defined keys and values on configuration objects in Icinga 2. These are commonly used to reference secrets in other configurations such as check commands to be able to authenticate with a service being checked. Icinga Web 2 displays these custom variables to logged in users with access to said hosts or services. In order to protect the secrets from being visible to anyone, it's possible to setup protection rules and blacklists in a user's role. Protection rules result in `***` being shown instead of the original value, the key will remain. Backlists will hide a custom variable entirely from the user. Besides using the UI, custom variables can also be accessed differently by using an undocumented URL parameter. By adding a parameter to the affected routes, Icinga Web 2 will show these columns additionally in the respective list. This parameter is also respected when exporting to JSON or CSV. Protection rules and blacklists however have no effect in this case. Custom variables are shown as-is in the result. The issue has been fixed in the 2.9.0, 2.8.3, and 2.7.5 releases. As a workaround, one may set up a restriction to hide hosts and services with the custom variable in question.\n\n- CVE-2020-27831: A flaw was found in Red Hat Quay, where it does not properly protect the authorization token when authorizing email addresses for repository email notifications. This flaw allows an attacker to add email addresses they do not own to repository notifications.\n\n- CVE-2021-21396: wire-server is an open-source back end for Wire, a secure collaboration platform. In wire-server from version 2021-02-16 and before version 2021-03-02, the client metadata of all users was exposed in the `GET /users/list-clients` endpoint. The endpoint could be used by any logged in user who could request client details of any other user (no connection required) as far as they can find their User ID. The exposed metadata included id, class, type, location, time, and cookie. A user on a Wire backend could use this endpoint to find registration time and location for each device for a given list of users. As a workaround, remove `/list-clients` from nginx config. This has been fixed in version 2021-03-02.\n\n- CVE-2021-21400: wire-webapp is an open-source front end for Wire, a secure collaboration platform. In wire-webapp before version 2021-03-15-production.0, when being prompted to enter the app-lock passphrase, the typed passphrase will be sent into the most recently used chat when the user does not actively give focus to the input field. Input element focus is enforced programatically in version 2021-03-15-production.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-21621: Jenkins Support Core Plugin 2.72 and earlier provides the serialized user authentication as part of the \"About user (basic authentication details only)\" information, which can include the session ID of the user creating the support bundle in some configurations.\n\n- CVE-2021-21733: The management system of ZXCDN is impacted by the information leak vulnerability. Attackers can make further analysis according to the information returned by the program, and then obtain some sensitive information.

A specially crafted series of network requests can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information.\n\n- CVE-2021-22905: Nextcloud Android App (com.nextcloud.client) before v3.16.0 is vulnerable to information disclosure due to searches for sharees being performed by default on the lookup server instead of only using the local Nextcloud server unless a global search has been explicitly chosen by the user.\n\n- CVE-2021-22912: Nextcloud iOS before 3.4.2 suffers from an information disclosure vulnerability when searches for sharees utilize the lookup server by default instead of only on the local Nextcloud server unless a global search has been explicitly chosen by the user.\n\n- CVE-2021-22913: Nextcloud Deck before 1.2.7, 1.4.1 suffers from an information disclosure vulnerability when searches for sharees utilize the lookup server by default instead of only the local Nextcloud server unless a global search has been explicitly chosen by the user.\n\n- CVE-2021-41109: Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to version 4.10.4, for regular (non-LiveQuery) queries, the session token is removed from the response, but for LiveQuery payloads it is currently not. If a user has a LiveQuery subscription on the `Parse.User` class, all session tokens created during user sign-ups will be broadcast as part of the LiveQuery payload. A patch in version 4.10.4 removes session tokens from the LiveQuery payload. As a workaround, set `user.acl(new Parse.ACL())` in a beforeSave trigger to make the user private already on sign-up.\n\n- CVE-2021-41125: Scrapy is a high-level web crawling and scraping framework for Python. If you use `HttpAuthMiddleware` (i.e. the `http_user` and `http_pass` spider attributes) for HTTP authentication, all requests will expose your credentials to the request target. This includes requests generated by Scrapy components, such as `robots.txt` requests sent by Scrapy when the `ROBOTSTXT_OBEY` setting is set to `True`, or as requests reached through redirects. Upgrade to Scrapy 2.5.1 and use the new `http_auth_domain` spider attribute to control which domains are allowed to receive the configured HTTP authentication credentials. If you are using Scrapy 1.8 or a lower version, and upgrading to Scrapy 2.5.1 is not an option, you may upgrade to Scrapy 1.8.1 instead. If you cannot upgrade, set your HTTP authentication credentials on a per-request basis, using for example the `w3lib.http.basic_auth_header` function to convert your credentials into a value that you can assign to the `Authorization` header of your request, instead of defining your credentials globally using `HttpAuthMiddleware`.\n\n- CVE-2021-42089: An issue was discovered in Zammad before 4.1.1. The REST API discloses sensitive information.\n\n- CVE-2021-0602: In onCreateOptionsMenu of WifiNetworkDetailsFragment.java, there is a possible way for guest users to view and modify Wi-Fi settings for all configured APs due to a permissions bypass. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-10 Android-11Android ID: A-177573895\n\n- CVE-2021-37703: Discourse is an open-source platform for community discussion. In Discourse before versions 2.7.8 and 2.8.0.beta5, a user's read state for a topic such as the last read post number and the notification level is exposed.\n\n- CVE-2021-38999: IBM MQ Appliance could allow a local attacker to obtain sensitive information by inclusion of sensitive data within trace.\n\n- CVE-2021-20498: IBM Security Verify Access Docker 10.0.0 reveals version information in HTTP requests that could be used in further attacks against the system.

IBM X-Force ID: 199398.\n\n- CVE-2021-28544: Apache Subversion SVN authz protected copyfrom paths regression Subversion servers reveal 'copyfrom' paths that should be hidden according to configured path-based authorization (authz) rules. When a node has been copied from a protected location, users with access to the copy can see the 'copyfrom' path of the original. This also reveals the fact that the node was copied. Only the 'copyfrom' path is revealed; not its contents. Both httpd and svnserve servers are vulnerable.\n\n- CVE-2021-45310: Sangoma Technologies Corporation Switchvox Version 102409 is affected by an information disclosure vulnerability due to an improper access restriction. Users information such as first name, last name, acount id, server uuid, email address, profile image, number, timestamps, etc can be extracted by sending an unauthenticated HTTP GET request to the https://Switchvox-IP/main?cmd=invalid_browser.\n\n- CVE-2021-25118: The Yoast SEO WordPress plugin (from versions 16.7 until 17.2) discloses the full internal path of featured images in posts via the wp/v2/posts REST endpoints which could help an attacker identify other vulnerabilities or help during the exploitation of other identified vulnerabilities.\n\n- CVE-2021-38956: IBM Security Verify 10.0.0, 10.0.1.0, and 10.0.2.0 could disclose sensitive version information in HTTP response headers that could aid in further attacks against the system. IBM X-Force ID: 212038\n\n- CVE-2021-39013: IBM Cloud Pak for Security (CP4S) 1.7.2.0, 1.7.1.0, and 1.7.0.0 could allow an authenticated user to obtain sensitive information in HTTP responses that could be used in further attacks against the system.

There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-0654: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor in GitHub repository fgribreau/node-request-retry prior to 7.0.0.\n\n- CVE-2022-0577: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor in GitHub repository scrapy/scrapy prior to 2.6.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-30334: Brave before 1.34, when a Private Window with Tor Connectivity is used, leaks .onion URLs in Referer and Origin headers. NOTE: although this was fixed by Brave, the Brave documentation still advises \"Note that Private Windows with Tor Connectivity in Brave are just regular private windows that use Tor as a proxy. Brave does NOT implement most of the privacy protections from Tor Browser.\"\n\n- CVE-2022-39193: An issue was discovered in the CheckUser extension for MediaWiki through 1.39.x. Various components of this extension can expose information on the performer of edits and logged actions. This information should not allow public viewing: it is supposed to be viewable only by users with suppression rights.\n\n- CVE-2022-31308: A vulnerability in live_mfg.shtml of WAVLINK AERIAL X 1200M M79X3.V5030.191012 allows attackers to obtain sensitive router information via execution of the exec cmd function.\n\n- CVE-2022-31309: A vulnerability in live_check.shtml of WAVLINK AERIAL X 1200M M79X3.V5030.180719 allows attackers to obtain sensitive router information via execution of the exec cmd function.\n\n- CVE-2022-35147: DoraCMS v2.18 and earlier allows attackers to bypass login authentication via a crafted HTTP request.\n\n- CVE-2021-20260: A flaw was found in the Foreman project. The Datacenter plugin exposes the password through the API to an authenticated local attacker with view_hosts permission. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.\n\n- CVE-2022-23538: github.com/sylabs/scs-library-client is the Go client for the Singularity Container Services (SCS) Container Library Service. When the scs-library-client is used to pull a container image, with authentication, the HTTP Authorization header sent by the client to the library service may be incorrectly leaked to an S3 backing storage provider. This occurs in a specific flow, where the library service redirects the client to a backing S3 storage server, to perform a multi-part concurrent download. Depending on site configuration, the S3 service may be provided by a third party. An attacker with access to the S3 service may be able to extract user credentials, allowing them to impersonate the user. The vulnerable multi-part concurrent download flow, with redirect to S3, is only used when communicating with a Singularity Enterprise 1.x installation, or third party server implementing this flow. Interaction with Singularity Enterprise 2.x, and Singularity Container Services (cloud.sylabs.io), does not trigger the vulnerable flow. We encourage all users to update. Users who interact with a Singularity Enterprise 1.x installation, using a 3rd party S3 storage service, are advised to revoke and recreate their authentication tokens within Singularity Enterprise.

Prior to version 0.7.0, the nestjs-proxy library did not have a way to control when Authorization headers should should be forwarded for specific backend services configured by the application developer. This could have resulted in sensitive information such as OAuth bearer access tokens being inadvertently exposed to such services that should not see them. A new feature has been introduced in the patched version of nestjs-proxy that allows application developers to opt out of forwarding the Authorization headers on a per service basis using the `forwardToken` config setting. Developers are advised to review the README for this library on Github or NPM for further details on how this configuration can be applied. This issue has been fixed in version 0.7.0 of `@finastra/nestjs-proxy`. Users of `@ffdc/nestjs-proxy` are advised that this package has been deprecated and is no longer being maintained or receiving updates. Such users should update their package.json file to use `@finastra/nestjs-proxy` instead.\n\n- CVE-2022-31070: NestJS Proxy is a NestJS module to decorate and proxy calls. Prior to version 0.7.0, the nestjs-proxy library did not have a way to block sensitive cookies (e.g. session cookies) from being forwarded to backend services configured by the application developer. This could have led to sensitive cookies being inadvertently exposed to such services that should not see them. The patched version now blocks cookies from being forwarded by default. However developers can configure an allow-list of cookie names by using the `allowedCookies` config setting. This issue has been fixed in version 0.7.0 of `@finastra/nestjs-proxy`. Users of `@ffdc/nestjs-proxy` are advised that this package has been deprecated and is no longer being maintained or receiving updates. Such users should update their package.json file to use `@finastra/nestjs-proxy` instead.\n\n- CVE-2022-3348: Just like in the previous report, an attacker could steal the account of different users.

An x86 PV guest can trigger a host OS crash when handling guest access to MSR_MISC_ENABLE. When a guest accesses certain Model Specific Registers, Xen first reads the value from hardware to use as the basis for auditing the guest access. For the MISC_ENABLE MSR, which is an Intel specific MSR, this MSR read is performed without error handling for a #GP fault, which is the consequence of trying to read this MSR on non-Intel hardware. A buggy or malicious PV guest administrator can crash Xen, resulting in a host Denial of Service. Only x86 systems are vulnerable. ARM systems are not vulnerable. Only Xen versions 4.11 and onwards are vulnerable. 4.10 and earlier are not vulnerable. Only x86 systems that do not implement the MISC_ENABLE MSR (0x1a0) are vulnerable. AMD and Hygon systems do not implement this MSR and are vulnerable. Intel systems do implement this MSR and are not vulnerable. Other manufacturers have not been checked.

SmartVNC client fails to handle an exception properly if the program execution process is modified after sending a packet from the server, which could result in a Denial-of-Service condition.\n\n- CVE-2021-31353: An Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an attacker to inject a specific BGP update, causing the routing protocol daemon (RPD) to crash and restart, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS). Continued receipt and processing of the BGP update will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition. This issue affects very specific versions of Juniper Networks Junos OS: 19.3R3-S2; 19.4R3-S3; 20.2 versions 20.2R2-S3 and later, prior to 20.2R3-S2; 20.3 versions 20.3R2 and later, prior to 20.3R3; 20.4 versions 20.4R2 and later, prior to 20.4R3; 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R2. Juniper Networks Junos OS 20.1 is not affected by this issue. This issue also affects Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved: All versions prior to 20.4R2-S3-EVO, 20.4R3-EVO; 21.1-EVO versions prior to 21.1R2-EVO; 21.2-EVO versions prior to 21.2R2-EVO.\n\n- CVE-2021-33486: All versions of the CODESYS V3 Runtime Toolkit for VxWorks from version V3.5.8.0 and before version V3.5.17.10 have Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions.\n\n- CVE-2020-5403: Reactor Netty HttpServer, versions 0.9.3 and 0.9.4, is exposed to a URISyntaxException that causes the connection to be closed prematurely instead of producing a 400 response.\n\n- CVE-2020-25597: An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. There is mishandling of the constraint that once-valid event channels may not turn invalid. Logic in the handling of event channel operations in Xen assumes that an event channel, once valid, will not become invalid over the life time of a guest. However, operations like the resetting of all event channels may involve decreasing one of the bounds checked when determining validity. This may lead to bug checks triggering, crashing the host. An unprivileged guest may be able to crash Xen, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) for the entire system. All Xen versions from 4.4 onwards are vulnerable. Xen versions 4.3 and earlier are not vulnerable. Only systems with untrusted guests permitted to create more than the default number of event channels are vulnerable. This number depends on the architecture and type of guest. For 32-bit x86 PV guests, this is 1023; for 64-bit x86 PV guests, and for all ARM guests, this number is 4095. Systems where untrusted guests are limited to fewer than this number are not vulnerable. Note that xl and libxl limit max_event_channels to 1023 by default, so systems using exclusively xl, libvirt+libxl, or their own toolstack based on libxl, and not explicitly setting max_event_channels, are not vulnerable.\n\n- CVE-2020-7693: Incorrect handling of Upgrade header with the value websocket leads in crashing of containers hosting sockjs apps.

The vulnerability arises due to unsafe usage of the logo_uri parameter in the Dynamic Client Registration request. An unauthenticated attacker can make a HTTP request from the vulnerable server to any address in the internal network and obtain its response (which might, for example, have a JavaScript payload for resultant XSS). The issue can be exploited to bypass network boundaries, obtain sensitive data, or attack other hosts in the internal network.\n\n- CVE-2021-27214: A Server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the ProductConfig servlet in Zoho ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus through 6013 allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to perform blind HTTP requests or perform a Cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against the administrative interface via an HTTP request, a different vulnerability than CVE-2019-3905.\n\n- CVE-2021-21287: MinIO is a High Performance Object Storage released under Apache License v2.0. In MinIO before version RELEASE.2021-01-30T00-20-58Z there is a server-side request forgery vulnerability. The target application may have functionality for importing data from a URL, publishing data to a URL, or otherwise reading data from a URL that can be tampered with. The attacker modifies the calls to this functionality by supplying a completely different URL or by manipulating how URLs are built (path traversal etc.). In a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack, the attacker can abuse functionality on the server to read or update internal resources. The attacker can supply or modify a URL which the code running on the server will read or submit data, and by carefully selecting the URLs, the attacker may be able to read server configuration such as AWS metadata, connect to internal services like HTTP enabled databases, or perform post requests towards internal services which are not intended to be exposed. This is fixed in version RELEASE.2021-01-30T00-20-58Z, all users are advised to upgrade. As a workaround you can disable the browser front-end with \"MINIO_BROWSER=off\" environment variable.\n\n- CVE-2021-39303: The server in Jamf Pro before 10.32.0 has an SSRF vulnerability, aka PI-006352. NOTE: Jamf Nation will also publish an article about this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2021-40091: An SSRF issue was discovered in SquaredUp for SCOM 5.2.1.6654.\n\n- CVE-2021-43780: Redash is a package for data visualization and sharing. In versions 10.0 and priorm the implementation of URL-loading data sources like JSON, CSV, or Excel is vulnerable to advanced methods of Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). These vulnerabilities are only exploitable on installations where a URL-loading data source is enabled. As of time of publication, the `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches address this by applying the Advocate library for making http requests instead of the requests library directly. Users should upgrade to version 10.0.1 to receive this patch. There are a few workarounds for mitigating the vulnerability without upgrading. One can disable the vulnerable data sources entirely, by adding the following env variable to one's configuration, making them unavailable inside the webapp. One can switch any data source of certain types (viewable in the GitHub Security Advisory) to be `View Only` for all groups on the Settings > Groups > Data Sources screen. For users unable to update an admin may modify Redash's configuration through environment variables to mitigate this issue. Depending on the version of Redash, an admin may also need to run a CLI command to re-encrypt some fields in the database. The `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches as of time of publication have removed the default value for `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET`. All future releases will also require this to be set explicitly. For existing installations, one will need to ensure that explicit values are set for the `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET` and `REDASH_SECRET_KEY `variables.\n\n- CVE-2021-27561: Yealink Device Management (DM) 3.6.0.20 allows command injection as root via the /sm/api/v1/firewall/zone/services URI, without authentication.\n\n- CVE-2021-29475: HedgeDoc (formerly known as CodiMD) is an open-source collaborative markdown editor. An attacker is able to receive arbitrary files from the file system when exporting a note to PDF. Since the code injection has to take place as note content, there fore this exploit requires the attackers ability to modify a note. This will affect all instances, which have pdf export enabled. This issue has been fixed by https://github.com/hedgedoc/hedgedoc/commit/c1789474020a6d668d616464cb2da5e90e123f65 and is available in version 1.5.0. Starting the CodiMD/HedgeDoc instance with `CMD_ALLOW_PDF_EXPORT=false` or set `\"allowPDFExport\": false` in config.json can mitigate this issue for those who cannot upgrade. This exploit works because while PhantomJS doesn't actually render the `file:///` references to the PDF file itself, it still uses them internally, and exfiltration is possible, and easy through JavaScript rendering. The impact is pretty bad, as the attacker is able to read the CodiMD/HedgeDoc `config.json` file as well any other files on the filesystem. Even though the suggested Docker deploy option doesn't have many interesting files itself, the `config.json` still often contains sensitive information, database credentials, and maybe OAuth secrets among other things.\n\n- CVE-2021-45968: An issue was discovered in xmppserver jar in the XMPP Server component of the JIve platform, as used in Pascom Cloud Phone System before 7.20.x (and in other products). An endpoint in the backend Tomcat server of the Pascom allows SSRF, a related issue to CVE-2019-18394.\n\n- CVE-2021-21973: The vSphere Client (HTML5) contains an SSRF (Server Side Request Forgery) vulnerability due to improper validation of URLs in a vCenter Server plugin.

An attacker could make the application perform arbitrary requests to fishing steal cookie, request to private area, or lead to xss...\n\n- CVE-2022-23544: MeterSphere is a one-stop open source continuous testing platform, covering test management, interface testing, UI testing and performance testing. Versions prior to 2.5.0 are subject to a Server-Side Request Forgery that leads to Cross-Site Scripting. A Server-Side request forgery in `IssueProxyResourceService::getMdImageByUrl` allows an attacker to access internal resources, as well as executing JavaScript code in the context of Metersphere's origin by a victim of a reflected XSS. This vulnerability has been fixed in v2.5.0. There are no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-41040: Microsoft Exchange Server Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2022-29180: A vulnerability in which attackers could forge HTTP requests to manipulate the `charm` data directory to access or delete anything on the server. This has been patched and is available in release [v0.12.1](https://github.com/charmbracelet/charm/releases/tag/v0.12.1). We recommend that all users running self-hosted `charm` instances update immediately. This vulnerability was found in-house and we haven't been notified of any potential exploiters. ### Additional notes * Encrypted user data uploaded to the Charm server is safe as Charm servers cannot decrypt user data. This includes filenames, paths, and all key-value data. * Users running the official Charm [Docker images](https://github.com/charmbracelet/charm/blob/main/docker.md) are at minimal risk because the exploit is limited to the containerized filesystem.\n\n- CVE-2022-29847: In Progress Ipswitch WhatsUp Gold 21.0.0 through 21.1.1, and 22.0.0, it is possible for an unauthenticated attacker to invoke an API transaction that would allow them to relay encrypted WhatsUp Gold user credentials to an arbitrary host.\n\n- CVE-2022-39055: RAVA certificate validation system has inadequate filtering for URL parameter.

In versions prior to 1.3.0 there exists a DoS vulnerability that is possible due to a bug in the library that would allow an attacker with specifically designed queries to cause stack overflow panics. Any user with access to the GraphQL handler can send these queries and cause stack overflows. This in turn could potentially compromise the ability of the server to serve data to its users. The issue has been patched in version `v1.3.0`. The only known workaround for this issue is to disable the `graphql.MaxDepth` option from your schema which is not recommended.\n\n- CVE-2022-23591: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The `GraphDef` format in TensorFlow does not allow self recursive functions. The runtime assumes that this invariant is satisfied. However, a `GraphDef` containing a fragment such as the following can be consumed when loading a `SavedModel`. This would result in a stack overflow during execution as resolving each `NodeDef` means resolving the function itself and its nodes. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2022-24675: encoding/pem in Go before 1.17.9 and 1.18.x before 1.18.1 has a Decode stack overflow via a large amount of PEM data.\n\n- CVE-2022-31019: Vapor is a server-side Swift HTTP web framework. When using automatic content decoding an attacker can craft a request body that can make the server crash with the following request: `curl -d \"array[_0][0][array][_0][0][array]$(for f in $(seq 1100); do echo -n '[_0][0][array]'; done)[string][_0]=hello%20world\" http://localhost:8080/foo`. The issue is unbounded, attacker controlled stack growth which will at some point lead to a stack overflow and a process crash. This issue has been fixed in version 4.61.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-31099: rulex is a new, portable, regular expression language. When parsing untrusted rulex expressions, the stack may overflow, possibly enabling a Denial of Service attack. This happens when parsing an expression with several hundred levels of nesting, causing the process to abort immediately. This is a security concern for you, if your service parses untrusted rulex expressions (expressions provided by an untrusted user), and your service becomes unavailable when the process running rulex aborts due to a stack overflow. The crash is fixed in version **0.4.3**. Affected users are advised to update to this version. There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-3216: A vulnerability has been found in Nintendo Game Boy Color and classified as problematic.

Versions prior to 1.4.20 may allow a remote attacker to terminate the application with a stack overflow error, resulting in a denial of service only via manipulation the processed input stream. The attack uses the hash code implementation for collections and maps to force recursive hash calculation causing a stack overflow. This issue is patched in version 1.4.20 which handles the stack overflow and raises an InputManipulationException instead. A potential workaround for users who only use HashMap or HashSet and whose XML refers these only as default map or set, is to change the default implementation of java.util.Map and java.util per the code example in the referenced advisory. However, this implies that your application does not care about the implementation of the map and all elements are comparable.\n\n- CVE-2022-47662: GPAC MP4Box 2.1-DEV-rev649-ga8f438d20 has a segment fault (/stack overflow) due to infinite recursion in Media_GetSample isomedia/media.c:662\n\n- CVE-2022-23460: Jsonxx or Json++ is a JSON parser, writer and reader written in C++.

            "matched_text": "CWE-1286: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input\n\nType: Base\n\nStatus: Incomplete\n\nDescription:\n\nThe product receives input that is expected to be well-formed - i.e., to comply with a certain syntax - but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input complies with the syntax.\n\nExtended Details:\n\n\n\nOften, complex inputs are expected to follow a particular syntax, which is either assumed by the input itself, or declared within metadata such as headers. The syntax could be for data exchange formats, markup languages, or even programming languages. When untrusted input is not properly validated for the expected syntax, attackers could cause parsing failures, trigger unexpected errors, or expose latent vulnerabilities that might not be directly exploitable if the input had conformed to the syntax.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2016-4029: Chain: incorrect validation of intended decimal-based IP address format (CWE-1286) enables parsing of octal or hexadecimal formats (CWE-1389), allowing bypass of an SSRF protection mechanism (CWE-918).\n\n- CVE-2007-5893: HTTP request with missing protocol version number leads to crash\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-33195: Go before 1.15.13 and 1.16.x before 1.16.5 has functions for DNS lookups that do not validate replies from DNS servers, and thus a return value may contain an unsafe injection (e.g., XSS) that does not conform to the RFC1035 format.\n\n- CVE-2021-21705: In PHP versions 7.3.x below 7.3.29, 7.4.x below 7.4.21 and 8.0.x below 8.0.8, when using URL validation functionality via filter_var() function with FILTER_VALIDATE_URL parameter, an URL with invalid password field can be accepted as valid. This can lead to the code incorrectly parsing the URL and potentially leading to other security implications - like contacting a wrong server or making a wrong access decision.\n\n- CVE-2021-23853: In Bosch IP cameras, improper validation of the HTTP header allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTTP headers through crafted URLs.\n\n- CVE-2021-25465: An improper scheme check vulnerability in Samsung Themes prior to version 5.2.01 allows attackers to perform Man-in-the-middle attack.\n\n- CVE-2021-29418: The netmask package before 2.0.1 for Node.js mishandles certain unexpected characters in an IP address string, such as an octal digit of 9. This (in some situations) allows attackers to bypass access control that is based on IP addresses. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2021-28918.\n\n- CVE-2021-45223: An issue was discovered in COINS Construction Cloud 11.12. Due to insufficient input neutralization, it is vulnerable to denial of service attacks via forced server crashes.\n\n- CVE-2021-45687: An issue was discovered in the raw-cpuid crate before 9.1.1 for Rust. If the serialize feature is used (which is not the the default), a Deserialize operation may lack sufficient validation, leading to memory corruption or a panic.\n\n- CVE-2022-22176: An Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input vulnerability in the Juniper DHCP daemon (jdhcpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an adjacent unauthenticated attacker sending a malformed DHCP packet to cause a crash of jdhcpd and thereby a Denial of Service (DoS). If option-82 is configured in a DHCP snooping / -security scenario, jdhcpd crashes if a specific malformed DHCP request packet is received. The DHCP functionality is impacted while jdhcpd restarts, and continued exploitation of the vulnerability will lead to the unavailability of the DHCP service and thereby a sustained DoS. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS 13.2 version 13.2R1 and later versions prior to 15.1R7-S11; 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R3-S6; 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R2-S9, 18.4R3-S10; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R2-S3, 19.1R3-S7; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S8, 19.2R3-S4; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R2-S7, 19.3R3-S4; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R3-S6; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R3-S3; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R3-S3; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R3-S1; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R3; 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R2-S1, 21.1R3; 21.2 versions prior to 21.2R1-S1, 21.2R2. This issue does not affect Juniper Networks Junos OS version 12.3R12 and prior versions.\n\n- CVE-2022-22192: An Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input vulnerability in the kernel of Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved on PTX series allows a network-based, unauthenticated attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS). When an incoming TCP packet destined to the device is malformed there is a possibility of a kernel panic. Only TCP packets destined to the ports for BGP, LDP and MSDP can trigger this. This issue only affects PTX10004, PTX10008, PTX10016. No other PTX Series devices or other platforms are affected. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved: 20.4-EVO versions prior to 20.4R3-S4-EVO; 21.3-EVO versions prior to 21.3R3-EVO; 21.4-EVO versions prior to 21.4R3-EVO; 22.1-EVO versions prior to 22.1R2-EVO. This issue does not affect Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved versions prior to 20.4R1-EVO.\n\n- CVE-2022-45113: Improper validation of syntactic correctness of input vulnerability exist in Movable Type series. Having a user to access a specially crafted URL may allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to set a specially crafted URL to the Reset Password page and conduct a phishing attack. Affected products/versions are as follows: Movable Type 7 r.5301 and earlier (Movable Type 7 Series), Movable Type Advanced 7 r.5301 and earlier (Movable Type Advanced 7 Series), Movable Type 6.8.7 and earlier (Movable Type 6 Series), Movable Type Advanced 6.8.7 and earlier (Movable Type Advanced 6 Series), Movable Type Premium 1.53 and earlier, and Movable Type Premium Advanced 1.53 and earlier.\n\n- CVE-2021-40017: The HW_KEYMASTER module lacks the validity check of the key format. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may result in out-of-bounds memory access.\n\n- CVE-2022-1941: A parsing vulnerability for the MessageSet type in the ProtocolBuffers versions prior to and including 3.16.1, 3.17.3, 3.18.2, 3.19.4, 3.20.1 and 3.21.5 for protobuf-cpp, and versions prior to and including 3.16.1, 3.17.3, 3.18.2, 3.19.4, 3.20.1 and 4.21.5 for protobuf-python can lead to out of memory failures. A specially crafted message with multiple key-value per elements creates parsing issues, and can lead to a Denial of Service against services receiving unsanitized input. We recommend upgrading to versions 3.18.3, 3.19.5, 3.20.2, 3.21.6 for protobuf-cpp and 3.18.3, 3.19.5, 3.20.2, 4.21.6 for protobuf-python. Versions for 3.16 and 3.17 are no longer updated.\n\n- CVE-2022-39376: GLPI stands for Gestionnaire Libre de Parc Informatique. GLPI is a Free Asset and IT Management Software package that provides ITIL Service Desk features, licenses tracking and software auditing. Users may be able to inject custom fields values in `mailto` links. This issue has been patched, please upgrade to version 10.0.4. There are currently no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-40277: Joplin version 2.8.8 allows an external attacker to execute arbitrary commands remotely on any client that opens a link in a malicious markdown file, via Joplin. This is possible because the application does not properly validate the schema/protocol of existing links in the markdown file before passing them to the 'shell.openExternal' function.\n\n- CVE-2022-41908: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. An input `token` that is not a UTF-8 bytestring will trigger a `CHECK` fail in `tf.raw_ops.PyFunc`. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 9f03a9d3bafe902c1e6beb105b2f24172f238645. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.11. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.10.1, 2.9.3, and TensorFlow 2.8.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2022-1431: An issue has been discovered in GitLab affecting all versions starting from 12.10 before 14.8.6, all versions starting from 14.9 before 14.9.4, all versions starting from 14.10 before 14.10.1. GitLab was not correctly handling malicious requests to the PyPi API endpoint allowing the attacker to cause uncontrolled resource consumption.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-20 (ChildOf)",

          "extended_description": "\n\nCross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:\n\n\n  1. Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.\n\n  1. The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.\n\n  1. During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.\n\n  1. A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.\n\n  1. Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.\n\n  1. This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.\n\nThere are three main kinds of XSS:\n\n  -  **Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent)**  - The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.\n\n  -  **Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent)**  - The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs. \n\n  -  **Type 0: DOM-Based XSS**  - In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible. \n\nOnce the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"\n\nIn many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.\n",

The HTML tag is broken, potentially allowing a Javascript injection attack.\n*   **Impact of exploitation:** JavaScript injection.\n*   **Attack vectors:**\n    1.  Visit any wiki page, such that mw.Api() has loaded\n    2.  Open the console\n    3.  Perform any mw.Api call that generates HTML, such that you can make the first character inside a tag be U+0338 COMBINING LONG SOLIDUS OVERLAY.\n\n    For example, call { action: 'visualeditor', paction: 'parsefragment' } as follows:\n\n    ```\n    const COMBINING_LONG_SOLIDUS = '\\u0338';\n    new mw.Api().post( {\n            action:  'visualeditor',\n            paction: 'parsefragment',\n            page: 'Test',\n            wikitext: COMBINING_LONG_SOLIDUS + ' onmouseover=\"alert(42)\" >content'\n    } ).done( ( data ) => {\n            const content = data.visualeditor.content;\n            document.body.innerHTML = content\n            console.log( 'Content:', content );\n    } ).fail( ( err ) => console.error( err ) );\n    ```\n\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to inject the specific unicode character sequence ('>' + U+0338) into the HTML output. The attacker needs to be able to perform an mw.Api call and inject javascript.\n*   **Mitigation or fix:** The patch ensures emitted HTML is safe against Unicode NFC normalization. The fix is to add U+0338 escaping to every place in Message.php which had a call to htmlspecialchars. The patches include:\n    *   0001-Ensure-emitted-HTML-is-safe-against-Unicode-NFC-norm.patch\n    *   0001-Entity-escape-U-0338-where-needed-to-make-HTML-outpu.patch\n    *   Backports for the core patch in REL1\\_39, REL1\\_42, REL1\\_43, and master.\n\n**Content from phabricator.wikimedia.org_c7a21489_20250624_211403.html (text)**\n\nUNRELATED\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 113 | Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting') | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.041 |\n| 2 | 400 | Uncontrolled Resource Consumption | Class | Discouraged | sparse | 0.041 |\n| 3 | 269 | Improper Privilege Management | Class | Discouraged | sparse | 0.041 |\n| 4 | 77 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection') | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.040 |\n| 5 | 201 | Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.039 |\n| 6 | 639 | Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key | Base | Allowed | dense | 0.523 |\n| 7 | 79 | Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.003 |\n| 8 | 755 | Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions | Class | Discouraged | sparse | 0.038 |\n| 9 | 918 | Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.037 |\n| 10 | 674 | Uncontrolled Recursion | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.037 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product receives data from an HTTP agent/component (e.g., web server, proxy, browser, etc.), but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CR and LF characters before the data is included in outgoing HTTP headers.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\n HTTP agents or components may include a web server, load balancer, reverse proxy, web caching proxy, application firewall, web browser, etc. Regardless of the role, they are expected to maintain coherent, consistent HTTP communication state across all components. However, including unexpected data in an HTTP header allows an attacker to specify the entirety of the HTTP message that is rendered by the client HTTP agent (e.g., web browser) or back-end HTTP agent (e.g., web server), whether the message is part of a request or a response. \n\n\nWhen an HTTP request contains unexpected CR and LF characters, the server may respond with an output stream that is interpreted as \"splitting\" the stream into two different HTTP messages instead of one. CR is carriage return, also given by %0d or \\r, and LF is line feed, also given by %0a or \\n.\n\n\nIn addition to CR and LF characters, other valid/RFC compliant special characters and unique character encodings can be utilized, such as HT (horizontal tab, also given by %09 or \\t) and SP (space, also given as + sign or %20).\n\n\nThese types of unvalidated and unexpected data in HTTP message headers allow an attacker to control the second \"split\" message to mount attacks such as server-side request forgery, cross-site scripting, and cache poisoning attacks.\n\n\nHTTP response splitting weaknesses may be present when:\n\n\n  1. Data enters a web application through an untrusted source, most frequently an HTTP request.\n\n  1. The data is included in an HTTP response header sent to a web user without neutralizing malicious characters that can be interpreted as separator characters for headers.\n\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nHTTP Request Splitting\nHTTP Response Splitting\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-93\nCanPrecede -> CWE-79\nChildOf -> CWE-20\nChildOf -> CWE-436\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2020-15811:** Chain: Proxy uses a substring search instead of parsing the Transfer-Encoding header (CWE-697), allowing request splitting (CWE-113) and cache poisoning\n- **CVE-2021-41084:** Scala-based HTTP interface allows request splitting and response splitting through header names, header values, status reasons, and URIs\n- **CVE-2018-12116:** Javascript-based framework allows request splitting through a path option of an HTTP request\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not properly control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource, thereby enabling an actor to influence the amount of resources consumed, eventually leading to the exhaustion of available resources.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nLimited resources include memory, file system storage, database connection pool entries, and CPU. If an attacker can trigger the allocation of these limited resources, but the number or size of the resources is not controlled, then the attacker could cause a denial of service that consumes all available resources. This would prevent valid users from accessing the product, and it could potentially have an impact on the surrounding environment. For example, a memory exhaustion attack against an application could slow down the application as well as its host operating system.\n\n\nThere are at least three distinct scenarios which can commonly lead to resource exhaustion:\n\n\n  - Lack of throttling for the number of allocated resources\n\n  - Losing all references to a resource before reaching the shutdown stage\n\n  - Not closing/returning a resource after processing\n\nResource exhaustion problems are often result due to an incorrect implementation of the following situations:\n\n  - Error conditions and other exceptional circumstances.\n\n  - Confusion over which part of the program is responsible for releasing the resource.\n\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nResource Exhaustion\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-664\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** CWE-400 is intended for incorrect behaviors in which the product is expected to track and restrict how many resources it consumes, but CWE-400 is often misused because it is conflated with the \"technical impact\" of vulnerabilities in which resource consumption occurs. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).\n**Comments:** Closely analyze the specific mistake that is causing resource consumption, and perform a CWE mapping for that mistake. Consider children/descendants such as CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling, CWE-771: Missing Reference to Active Allocated Resource, CWE-410: Insufficient Resource Pool, CWE-772: Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime, CWE-834: Excessive Iteration, CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification), and others.\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** \"Resource consumption\" could be interpreted as a consequence instead of an insecure behavior, so this entry is being considered for modification. It appears to be referenced too frequently when more precise mappings are available. Some of its children, such as CWE-771, might be better considered as a chain.\n\n**[Theoretical]** Vulnerability theory is largely about how behaviors and resources interact. \"Resource exhaustion\" can be regarded as either a consequence or an attack, depending on the perspective. This entry is an attempt to reflect the underlying weaknesses that enable these attacks (or consequences) to take place.\n\n**[Other]** \n\nDatabase queries that take a long time to process are good DoS targets. An attacker would have to write a few lines of Perl code to generate enough traffic to exceed the site's ability to keep up. This would effectively prevent authorized users from using the site at all. Resources can be exploited simply by ensuring that the target machine must do much more work and consume more resources in order to service a request than the attacker must do to initiate a request.\n\n\nA prime example of this can be found in old switches that were vulnerable to \"macof\" attacks (so named for a tool developed by Dugsong). These attacks flooded a switch with random IP and MAC address combinations, therefore exhausting the switch's cache, which held the information of which port corresponded to which MAC addresses. Once this cache was exhausted, the switch would fail in an insecure way and would begin to act simply as a hub, broadcasting all traffic on all ports and allowing for basic sniffing attacks.\n\n\n**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the \"Mapping CWE to 62443\" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).\n- **CVE-2020-7218:** Go-based workload orchestrator does not limit resource usage with unauthenticated connections, allowing a DoS by flooding the service\n- **CVE-2020-3566:** Resource exhaustion in distributed OS because of \"insufficient\" IGMP queue management, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not properly assign, modify, track, or check privileges for an actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** CWE-269 is commonly misused. It can be conflated with \"privilege escalation,\" which is a technical impact that is listed in many low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is not useful for trend analysis.\n**Comments:** If an error or mistake allows privilege escalation, then use the CWE ID for that mistake. Avoid using CWE-269 when only phrases such as \"privilege escalation\" or \"gain privileges\" are available, as these indicate technical impact of the vulnerability - not the root cause weakness. If the root cause seems to be directly related to privileges, then examine the children of CWE-269 for additional hints, such as Execution with Unnecessary Privileges (CWE-250) or Incorrect Privilege Assignment (CWE-266).\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** The relationships between privileges, permissions, and actors (e.g. users and groups) need further refinement within the Research view. One complication is that these concepts apply to two different pillars, related to control of resources (CWE-664) and protection mechanism failures (CWE-693).\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2001-1555:** Terminal privileges are not reset when a user logs out.\n- **CVE-2001-1514:** Does not properly pass security context to child processes in certain cases, allows privilege escalation.\n- **CVE-2001-0128:** Does not properly compute roles.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product constructs all or part of a command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended command when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nMany protocols and products have their own custom command language. While OS or shell command strings are frequently discovered and targeted, developers may not realize that these other command languages might also be vulnerable to attacks.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nCommand injection: an attack-oriented phrase for this weakness. Note: often used when \"OS command injection\" (CWE-78) was intended.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-74\nChildOf -> CWE-74\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** CWE-77 is often misused when OS command injection (CWE-78) was intended instead [REF-1287].\n**Comments:** Ensure that the analysis focuses on the root-cause error that allows the execution of commands, as there are many weaknesses that can lead to this consequence. See Terminology Notes. If the weakness involves a command language besides OS shell invocation, then CWE-77 could be used.\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n**Suggested Alternatives:**\n- CWE-78: OS Command Injection\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Terminology]** \n\nThe \"command injection\" phrase carries different meanings, either as an attack or as a technical impact. The most common usage of \"command injection\" refers to the more-accurate OS command injection (CWE-78), but there are many command languages.\n\n\nIn vulnerability-focused analysis, the phrase may refer to any situation in which the adversary can execute commands of their own choosing, i.e., the focus is on the risk and/or technical impact of exploitation. Many proof-of-concept exploits focus on the ability to execute commands and may emphasize \"command injection.\" However, there are dozens of weaknesses that can allow execution of commands. That is, the ability to execute commands could be resultant from another weakness.\n\n\nTo some, \"command injection\" can include cases in which the functionality intentionally allows the user to specify an entire command, which is then executed. In this case, the root cause weakness might be related to missing or incorrect authorization, since an adversary should not be able to specify arbitrary commands, but some users or admins are allowed.\n\n\nCWE-77 and its descendants are specifically focused on behaviors in which the product is intentionally building a command to execute, and the adversary can inject separators into the command or otherwise change the command being executed.\n\n\n**[Other]** \n\nCommand injection is a common problem with wrapper programs.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-1509:** injection of sed script syntax (\"sed injection\")\n- **CVE-2024-5184:** API service using a large generative AI model allows direct prompt injection to leak hard-coded system prompts or execute other prompts.\n- **CVE-2020-11698:** anti-spam product allows injection of SNMP commands into confiuration file\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-200\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-209\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-202\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Other]** Sensitive information could include data that is sensitive in and of itself (such as credentials or private messages), or otherwise useful in the further exploitation of the system (such as internal file system structure).\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-0708:** Collaboration platform does not clear team emails in a response, allowing leak of email addresses\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nRetrieval of a user record occurs in the system based on some key value that is under user control. The key would typically identify a user-related record stored in the system and would be used to lookup that record for presentation to the user. It is likely that an attacker would have to be an authenticated user in the system. However, the authorization process would not properly check the data access operation to ensure that the authenticated user performing the operation has sufficient entitlements to perform the requested data access, hence bypassing any other authorization checks present in the system.\n\n\nFor example, attackers can look at places where user specific data is retrieved (e.g. search screens) and determine whether the key for the item being looked up is controllable externally. The key may be a hidden field in the HTML form field, might be passed as a URL parameter or as an unencrypted cookie variable, then in each of these cases it will be possible to tamper with the key value.\n\n\nOne manifestation of this weakness is when a system uses sequential or otherwise easily-guessable session IDs that would allow one user to easily switch to another user's session and read/modify their data.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nInsecure Direct Object Reference / IDOR: The \"Insecure Direct Object Reference\" term, as described in the OWASP Top Ten, is broader than this CWE because it also covers path traversal (CWE-22). Within the context of vulnerability theory, there is a similarity between the OWASP concept and CWE-706: Use of Incorrectly-Resolved Name or Reference.\nBroken Object Level Authorization / BOLA: BOLA is used in the 2019 OWASP API Security Top 10 and is said to be the same as IDOR.\nHorizontal Authorization: \"Horizontal Authorization\" is used to describe situations in which two users have the same privilege level, but must be prevented from accessing each other's resources. This is fairly common when using key-based access to resources in a multi-user context.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-863\nChildOf -> CWE-863\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-36539:** An educational application does not appropriately restrict file IDs to a particular user. The attacker can brute-force guess IDs, indicating IDOR.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nCross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:\n\n\n  1. Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.\n\n  1. The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.\n\n  1. During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.\n\n  1. A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.\n\n  1. Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.\n\n  1. This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.\n\nThere are three main kinds of XSS:\n\n  -  **Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent)**  - The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.\n\n  -  **Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent)**  - The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs. \n\n  -  **Type 0: DOM-Based XSS**  - In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible. \n\nOnce the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"\n\nIn many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nXSS: A common abbreviation for Cross-Site Scripting.\nHTML Injection: Used as a synonym of stored (Type 2) XSS.\nCSS: In the early years after initial discovery of XSS, \"CSS\" was a commonly-used acronym. However, this would cause confusion with \"Cascading Style Sheets,\" so usage of this acronym has declined significantly.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-74\nChildOf -> CWE-74\nCanPrecede -> CWE-494\nPeerOf -> CWE-352\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** \n\nThere can be a close relationship between XSS and CSRF (CWE-352). An attacker might use CSRF in order to trick the victim into submitting requests to the server in which the requests contain an XSS payload. A well-known example of this was the Samy worm on MySpace [REF-956]. The worm used XSS to insert malicious HTML sequences into a user's profile and add the attacker as a MySpace friend. MySpace friends of that victim would then execute the payload to modify their own profiles, causing the worm to propagate exponentially. Since the victims did not intentionally insert the malicious script themselves, CSRF was a root cause.\n\n\n**[Applicable Platform]** \n\nXSS flaws are very common in web applications, since they require a great deal of developer discipline to avoid them.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-25926:** Python Library Manager did not sufficiently neutralize a user-supplied search term, allowing reflected XSS.\n- **CVE-2021-25963:** Python-based e-commerce platform did not escape returned content on error pages, allowing for reflected Cross-Site Scripting attacks.\n- **CVE-2021-1879:** Universal XSS in mobile operating system, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-703\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2023-41151:** SDK for OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) server has uncaught exception when a socket is blocked for writing but the server tries to send an error\n- **[REF-1374]:** Chain: JavaScript-based cryptocurrency library can fall back to the insecure Math.random() function instead of reporting a failure (CWE-392), thus reducing the entropy (CWE-332) and leading to generation of non-unique cryptographic keys for Bitcoin wallets (CWE-1391)\n- **CVE-2021-3011:** virtual interrupt controller in a virtualization product allows crash of host by writing a certain invalid value to a register, which triggers a fatal error instead of returning an error code\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe web server receives a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nXSPA: Cross Site Port Attack\nSSRF: Server-Side Request Forgery\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-441\nChildOf -> CWE-610\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** CWE-918 (SSRF) and CWE-611 (XXE) are closely related, because they both involve web-related technologies and can launch outbound requests to unexpected destinations. However, XXE can be performed client-side, or in other contexts in which the software is not acting directly as a server, so the \"Server\" portion of the SSRF acronym does not necessarily apply.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2023-32786:** Chain: LLM integration framework has prompt injection (CWE-1427) that allows an attacker to force the service to retrieve data from an arbitrary URL, essentially providing SSRF (CWE-918) and potentially injecting content into downstream tasks.\n- **CVE-2021-26855:** Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in mail server, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2021-21973:** Server Side Request Forgery in cloud platform, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-674: Uncontrolled Recursion\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not properly control the amount of recursion that takes place,  consuming excessive resources, such as allocated memory or the program stack.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nStack Exhaustion\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-834\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2007-1285:** Deeply nested arrays trigger stack exhaustion.\n- **CVE-2007-3409:** Self-referencing pointers create infinite loop and resultant stack exhaustion.\n- **CVE-2016-10707:** Javascript application accidentally changes input in a way that prevents a recursive call from detecting an exit condition.\n\n",

However, including unexpected data in an HTTP header allows an attacker to specify the entirety of the HTTP message that is rendered by the client HTTP agent (e.g., web browser) or back-end HTTP agent (e.g., web server), whether the message is part of a request or a response. \n\n\nWhen an HTTP request contains unexpected CR and LF characters, the server may respond with an output stream that is interpreted as \"splitting\" the stream into two different HTTP messages instead of one. CR is carriage return, also given by %0d or \\r, and LF is line feed, also given by %0a or \\n.\n\n\nIn addition to CR and LF characters, other valid/RFC compliant special characters and unique character encodings can be utilized, such as HT (horizontal tab, also given by %09 or \\t) and SP (space, also given as + sign or %20).\n\n\nThese types of unvalidated and unexpected data in HTTP message headers allow an attacker to control the second \"split\" message to mount attacks such as server-side request forgery, cross-site scripting, and cache poisoning attacks.\n\n\nHTTP response splitting weaknesses may be present when:\n\n\n  1. Data enters a web application through an untrusted source, most frequently an HTTP request.\n\n  1. The data is included in an HTTP response header sent to a web user without neutralizing malicious characters that can be interpreted as separator characters for headers.\n\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-15811: Chain: Proxy uses a substring search instead of parsing the Transfer-Encoding header (CWE-697), allowing request splitting (CWE-113) and cache poisoning\n\n- CVE-2021-41084: Scala-based HTTP interface allows request splitting and response splitting through header names, header values, status reasons, and URIs\n\n- CVE-2018-12116: Javascript-based framework allows request splitting through a path option of an HTTP request\n\n- CVE-2004-2146: Application accepts CRLF in an object ID, allowing HTTP response splitting.\n\n- CVE-2004-1656: Shopping cart allows HTTP response splitting to perform HTML injection via CRLF in a parameter for a url\n\n- CVE-2005-2060: Bulletin board allows response splitting via CRLF in parameter.\n\n- CVE-2004-2512: Response splitting via CRLF in PHPSESSID.\n\n- CVE-2005-1951: e-commerce app allows HTTP response splitting using CRLF in object id parameters\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-0268: An Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Response Splitting') weakness in J-web of Juniper Networks Junos OS leads to buffer overflows, segment faults, or other impacts, which allows an attacker to modify the integrity of the device and exfiltration information from the device without authentication. The weakness can be exploited to facilitate cross-site scripting (XSS), cookie manipulation (modifying session cookies, stealing cookies) and more. This weakness can also be exploited by directing a user to a seemingly legitimate link from the affected site. The attacker requires no special access or permissions to the device to carry out such attacks. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS: 18.1 versions prior to 18.1R3-S11; 18.2 versions prior to 18.2R3-S5; 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R2-S4, 18.3R3-S3; 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R2-S5, 18.4R3-S3; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R2-S2, 19.1R3-S2; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S5, 19.2R2; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R3; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R1-S3, 19.4R2, 19.4R3; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R1-S2, 20.1R2. This issue does not affect Juniper Networks Junos OS versions prior to 18.1R1.\n\n- CVE-2021-28979: SafeNet KeySecure Management Console 8.12.0 is vulnerable to HTTP response splitting attacks. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using specially-crafted URL to cause the server to return a split response, once the URL is clicked.\n\n- CVE-2021-41084: http4s is an open source scala interface for HTTP. In affected versions http4s is vulnerable to response-splitting or request-splitting attacks when untrusted user input is used to create any of the following fields: Header names (`Header.name`\u00e5), Header values (`Header.value`), Status reason phrases (`Status.reason`), URI paths (`Uri.Path`), URI authority registered names (`URI.RegName`) (through 0.21). This issue has been resolved in versions 0.21.30, 0.22.5, 0.23.4, and 1.0.0-M27 perform the following. As a matter of practice http4s services and client applications should sanitize any user input in the aforementioned fields before returning a request or response to the backend. The carriage return, newline, and null characters are the most threatening.\n\n- CVE-2021-45818: SAFARI Montage 8.7.32 is affected by a CRLF injection vulnerability which can lead to HTTP response splitting.\n\n- CVE-2021-33621: The cgi gem before 0.1.0.2, 0.2.x before 0.2.2, and 0.3.x before 0.3.5 for Ruby allows HTTP response splitting. This is relevant to applications that use untrusted user input either to generate an HTTP response or to create a CGI::Cookie object.\n\n- CVE-2021-40336: A vulnerability exists in the http web interface where the web interface does not validate data in an HTTP header. This causes a possible HTTP response splitting, which if exploited could lead an attacker to channel down harmful code into the user\u2019s web browser, such as to steal the session cookies. Thus, an attacker who successfully makes an MSM user who has already established a session to MSM web interface clicks a forged link to the MSM web interface, e.g., the link is sent per E-Mail, could trick the user into downloading malicious software onto his computer. This issue affects: Hitachi Energy MSM V2.2 and prior versions.\n\n- CVE-2021-41437: An HTTP response splitting attack in web application in ASUS RT-AX88U before v3.0.0.4.388.20558 allows an attacker to craft a specific URL that if an authenticated victim visits it, the URL will give access to the cloud storage of the attacker.\n\n- CVE-2022-20772: A vulnerability in Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA) and Cisco Secure Email and Web Manager could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct an HTTP response splitting attack. This vulnerability is due to the failure of the application or its environment to properly sanitize input values. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious HTTP headers, controlling the response body, or splitting the response into multiple responses.\n\n- CVE-2022-35507: A response-header CRLF injection vulnerability in the Proxmox Virtual Environment (PVE) and Proxmox Mail Gateway (PMG) web interface allows a remote attacker to set cookies for a victim's browser that are longer than the server expects, causing a client-side DoS. This affects Chromium-based browsers because they allow injection of response headers with %0d. This is fixed in pve-http-server 4.1-3.\n\n- CVE-2022-37240: MDaemon Technologies SecurityGateway for Email Servers 8.5.2 is vulnerable to HTTP Response splitting via the format parameter.\n\n- CVE-2022-37242: MDaemon Technologies SecurityGateway for Email Servers 8.5.2, is vulnerable to HTTP Response splitting via the data parameter.\n\n- CVE-2022-37953: An HTTP response splitting vulnerability exists in the AM Gateway Challenge-Response dialog of WorkstationST (<v07.09.15) and could allow an attacker to compromise a victim's browser/session. WorkstationST is only deployed in specific, controlled environments rendering attack complexity significantly higher than if the attack were conducted on the software in isolation. WorkstationST v07.09.15 can be found in ControlST v07.09.07 SP8 and greater.\n\n- CVE-2022-42471: An improper neutralization of CRLF sequences in HTTP headers ('HTTP Response Splitting') vulnerability [CWE-113] In FortiWeb version 7.0.0 through 7.0.2, FortiWeb version 6.4.0 through 6.4.2, FortiWeb version 6.3.6 through 6.3.20 may allow an authenticated and remote attacker to inject arbitrary headers.\n\n- CVE-2022-42472: A improper neutralization of crlf sequences in http headers ('http response splitting') in Fortinet FortiOS versions 7.2.0 through 7.2.2, 7.0.0 through 7.0.8, 6.4.0 through 6.4.11, 6.2.0 through 6.2.12, 6.0.0 through 6.0.16, FortiProxy 7.2.0 through 7.2.1, 7.0.0 through 7.0.7, 2.0.0 through 2.0.10, 1.2.0 through 1.2.13, 1.1.0 through 1.1.6 may allow an authenticated and remote attacker to perform an HTTP request splitting attack which gives attackers control of the remaining headers and body of the response.\n\n- CVE-2022-47052: The web interface of the 'Nighthawk R6220 AC1200 Smart Wi-Fi Router' is vulnerable to a CRLF Injection attack that can be leveraged to perform Reflected XSS and HTML Injection. A malicious unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability using a specially crafted URL. This affects firmware versions: V1.1.0.112_1.0.1, V1.1.0.114_1.0.1.\n\n- CVE-2021-37499: CRLF vulnerability in Reprise License Manager (RLM) web interface through 14.2BL4 in the password parameter in View License Result function, that allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary HTTP headers.\n\n- CVE-2022-32453: HTTP header injection vulnerability in Cybozu Office 10.0.0 to 10.8.5 may allow a remote attacker to obtain and/or alter the data of the product via unspecified vectors.\n\n- CVE-2022-3918: A program using FoundationNetworking in swift-corelibs-foundation is potentially vulnerable to CRLF ( ) injection in URLRequest headers. In this vulnerability, a client can insert one or several CRLF sequences into a URLRequest header value. When that request is sent via URLSession to an HTTP server, the server may interpret the content after the CRLF as extra headers, or even a second request. For example, consider a URLRequest to http://example.com/ with the GET method. Suppose we set the URLRequest header \"Foo\" to the value \"Bar Extra-Header: Added GET /other HTTP/1.1\". When this request is sent, it will appear to the server as two requests: GET / HTTP/1.1 Foo: Bar Extra-Header: Added GET /other HTTP/1.1 In this manner, the client is able to inject extra headers and craft an entirely new request to a separate path, despite only making one API call in URLSession. If a developer has total control over the request and its headers, this vulnerability may not pose a threat. However, this vulnerability escalates if un-sanitized user input is placed in header values. If so, a malicious user could inject new headers or requests to an intermediary or backend server. Developers should be especially careful to sanitize user input in this case, or upgrade their version of swift-corelibs-foundation to include the patch below.\n\n- CVE-2022-4188: Insufficient validation of untrusted input in CORS in Google Chrome on Android prior to 108.0.5359.71 allowed a remote attacker to bypass same origin policy via a crafted HTML page.

If an attacker can trigger the allocation of these limited resources, but the number or size of the resources is not controlled, then the attacker could cause a denial of service that consumes all available resources. This would prevent valid users from accessing the product, and it could potentially have an impact on the surrounding environment. For example, a memory exhaustion attack against an application could slow down the application as well as its host operating system.\n\n\nThere are at least three distinct scenarios which can commonly lead to resource exhaustion:\n\n\n  - Lack of throttling for the number of allocated resources\n\n  - Losing all references to a resource before reaching the shutdown stage\n\n  - Not closing/returning a resource after processing\n\nResource exhaustion problems are often result due to an incorrect implementation of the following situations:\n\n  - Error conditions and other exceptional circumstances.\n\n  - Confusion over which part of the program is responsible for releasing the resource.\n\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-21668: Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).\n\n- CVE-2020-7218: Go-based workload orchestrator does not limit resource usage with unauthenticated connections, allowing a DoS by flooding the service\n\n- CVE-2020-3566: Resource exhaustion in distributed OS because of \"insufficient\" IGMP queue management, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2009-2874: Product allows attackers to cause a crash via a large number of connections.\n\n- CVE-2009-1928: Malformed request triggers uncontrolled recursion, leading to stack exhaustion.\n\n- CVE-2009-2858: Chain: memory leak (CWE-404) leads to resource exhaustion.\n\n- CVE-2009-2726: Driver does not use a maximum width when invoking sscanf style functions, causing stack consumption.\n\n- CVE-2009-2540: Large integer value for a length property in an object causes a large amount of memory allocation.\n\n- CVE-2009-2299: Web application firewall consumes excessive memory when an HTTP request contains a large Content-Length value but no POST data.\n\n- CVE-2009-2054: Product allows exhaustion of file descriptors when processing a large number of TCP packets.\n\n- CVE-2008-5180: Communication product allows memory consumption with a large number of SIP requests, which cause many sessions to be created.\n\n- CVE-2008-2121: TCP implementation allows attackers to consume CPU and prevent new connections using a TCP SYN flood attack.\n\n- CVE-2008-2122: Port scan triggers CPU consumption with processes that attempt to read data from closed sockets.\n\n- CVE-2008-1700: Product allows attackers to cause a denial of service via a large number of directives, each of which opens a separate window.\n\n- CVE-2007-4103: Product allows resource exhaustion via a large number of calls that do not complete a 3-way handshake.\n\n- CVE-2006-1173: Mail server does not properly handle deeply nested multipart MIME messages, leading to stack exhaustion.\n\n- CVE-2007-0897: Chain: anti-virus product encounters a malformed file but returns from a function without closing a file descriptor (CWE-775) leading to file descriptor consumption (CWE-400) and failed scans.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-22101: Cloud Controller versions prior to 1.118.0 are vulnerable to unauthenticated denial of Service(DoS) vulnerability allowing unauthenticated attackers to cause denial of service by using REST HTTP requests with label_selectors on multiple V3 endpoints by generating an enormous SQL query.\n\n- CVE-2021-1266: A vulnerability in the REST API of Cisco Managed Services Accelerator (MSX) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to the way that the affected software logs certain API requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a flood of crafted API requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition on the affected device.\n\n- CVE-2021-1312: A vulnerability in the system resource management of Cisco Elastic Services Controller (ESC) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) to the health monitor API on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to inadequate provisioning of kernel parameters for the maximum number of TCP connections and SYN backlog. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a flood of crafted TCP packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to block TCP listening ports that are used by the health monitor API. This vulnerability only affects customers who use the health monitor API.\n\n- CVE-2021-1378: A vulnerability in the SSH service of the Cisco StarOS operating system could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to stop processing traffic, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to a logic error that may occur under specific traffic conditions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of crafted packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to prevent the targeted service from receiving any traffic, which would lead to a DoS condition on the affected device.\n\n- CVE-2021-1489: A vulnerability in filesystem usage management for Cisco Firepower Device Manager (FDM) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to exhaust filesystem resources, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to the insufficient management of available filesystem resources. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading files to the device and exhausting available filesystem resources. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause database errors and cause the device to become unresponsive to web-based management. Manual intervention is required to free filesystem resources and return the device to an operational state.\n\n- CVE-2021-1460: A vulnerability in the Cisco IOx Application Framework of Cisco 809 Industrial Integrated Services Routers (Industrial ISRs), Cisco 829 Industrial ISRs, Cisco CGR 1000 Compute Module, and Cisco IC3000 Industrial Compute Gateway could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient error handling during packet processing. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a high and sustained rate of crafted TCP traffic to the IOx web server on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the IOx web server to stop processing requests, resulting in a DoS condition.\n\n- CVE-2021-0285: An uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability in Juniper Networks Junos OS on QFX5000 Series and EX4600 Series switches allows an attacker sending large amounts of legitimate traffic destined to the device to cause Interchassis Control Protocol (ICCP) interruptions, leading to an unstable control connection between the Multi-Chassis Link Aggregation Group (MC-LAG) nodes which can in turn lead to traffic loss. Continued receipt of this amount of traffic will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition. An indication that the system could be impacted by this issue is the following log message: \"DDOS_PROTOCOL_VIOLATION_SET: Warning: Host-bound traffic for protocol/exception LOCALNH:aggregate exceeded its allowed bandwidth at fpc <fpc number> for <n> times, started at <timestamp>\" This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on QFX5000 Series and EX4600 Series: 15.1 versions prior to 15.1R7-S9; 17.3 versions prior to 17.3R3-S11; 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R2-S13, 17.4R3-S5; 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R3-S5; 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R2-S8, 18.4R3-S7; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R3-S5; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S6, 19.2R3-S2; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R2-S6, 19.3R3-S2; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R1-S4, 19.4R2-S4, 19.4R3-S2; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R2-S2, 20.1R3; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R2-S3, 20.2R3; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R2; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R1-S1, 20.4R2.\n\n- CVE-2021-22119: Spring Security versions 5.5.x prior to 5.5.1, 5.4.x prior to 5.4.7, 5.3.x prior to 5.3.10 and 5.2.x prior to 5.2.11 are susceptible to a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack via the initiation of the Authorization Request in an OAuth 2.0 Client Web and WebFlux application. A malicious user or attacker can send multiple requests initiating the Authorization Request for the Authorization Code Grant, which has the potential of exhausting system resources using a single session or multiple sessions.\n\n- CVE-2021-43173: In NLnet Labs Routinator prior to 0.10.2, a validation run can be delayed significantly by an RRDP repository by not answering but slowly drip-feeding bytes to keep the connection alive. This can be used to effectively stall validation. While Routinator has a configurable time-out value for RRDP connections, this time-out was only applied to individual read or write operations rather than the complete request. Thus, if an RRDP repository sends a little bit of data before that time-out expired, it can continuously extend the time it takes for the request to finish. Since validation will only continue once the update of an RRDP repository has concluded, this delay will cause validation to stall, leading to Routinator continuing to serve the old data set or, if in the initial validation run directly after starting, never serve any data at all.\n\n- CVE-2020-12291: Uncontrolled resource consumption in some Intel(R) Thunderbolt(TM) controllers may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable denial of service via local access.\n\n- CVE-2020-12296: Uncontrolled resource consumption in some Intel(R) Thunderbolt(TM) controllers may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable denial of service via local access.\n\n- CVE-2020-1702: A malicious container image can consume an unbounded amount of memory when being pulled to a container runtime host, such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux using podman, or OpenShift Container Platform. An attacker can use this flaw to trick a user, with privileges to pull container images, into crashing the process responsible for pulling the image. This flaw affects containers-image versions before 5.2.0.\n\n- CVE-2020-1750: A flaw was found in the machine-config-operator that causes an OpenShift node to become unresponsive when a container consumes a large amount of memory. An attacker could use this flaw to deny access to schedule new pods in the OpenShift cluster. This was fixed in openshift/machine-config-operator 4.4.3, openshift/machine-config-operator 4.3.25, openshift/machine-config-operator 4.2.36.\n\n- CVE-2020-20217: Mikrotik RouterOs before 6.47 (stable tree) suffers from an uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability in the /nova/bin/route process. An authenticated remote attacker can cause a Denial of Service due to overloading the systems CPU.\n\n- CVE-2020-20221: Mikrotik RouterOs before 6.44.6 (long-term tree) suffers from an uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability in the /nova/bin/cerm process. An authenticated remote attacker can cause a Denial of Service due to overloading the systems CPU.\n\n- CVE-2020-20230: Mikrotik RouterOs before stable 6.47 suffers from an uncontrolled resource consumption in the sshd process. An authenticated remote attacker can cause a Denial of Service due to overloading the systems CPU.\n\n- CVE-2020-20248: Mikrotik RouterOs before stable 6.47 suffers from an uncontrolled resource consumption in the memtest process. An authenticated remote attacker can cause a Denial of Service due to overloading the systems CPU.\n\n- CVE-2020-25242: A vulnerability has been identified in SIMATIC NET CP 343-1 Advanced (incl. SIPLUS variants) (All versions), SIMATIC NET CP 343-1 Lean (incl. SIPLUS variants) (All versions), SIMATIC NET CP 343-1 Standard (incl. SIPLUS variants) (All versions). Specially crafted packets sent to TCP port 102 could cause a Denial-of-Service condition on the affected devices. A cold restart might be necessary in order to recover.\n\n- CVE-2020-28944: OX Guard 2.10.4 and earlier allows a Denial of Service via a WKS server that responds slowly or with a large amount of data.\n\n- CVE-2020-35498: A vulnerability was found in openvswitch. A limitation in the implementation of userspace packet parsing can allow a malicious user to send a specially crafted packet causing the resulting megaflow in the kernel to be too wide, potentially causing a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.\n\n- CVE-2020-35510: A flaw was found in jboss-remoting in versions before 5.0.20.SP1-redhat-00001. A malicious attacker could cause threads to hold up forever in the EJB server by writing a sequence of bytes corresponding to the expected messages of a successful EJB client request, but omitting the ACK messages, or just tamper with jboss-remoting code, deleting the lines that send the ACK message from the EJB client code resulting in a denial of service.

The resolution is to limit the number of allowable transforms to 2.\n\n- CVE-2021-21271: Tendermint Core is an open source Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) middleware that takes a state transition machine - written in any programming language - and securely replicates it on many machines. Tendermint Core v0.34.0 introduced a new way of handling evidence of misbehavior. As part of this, we added a new Timestamp field to Evidence structs. This timestamp would be calculated using the same algorithm that is used when a block is created and proposed. (This algorithm relies on the timestamp of the last commit from this specific block.) In Tendermint Core v0.34.0-v0.34.2, the consensus reactor is responsible for forming DuplicateVoteEvidence whenever double signs are observed. However, the current block is still \u201cin flight\u201d when it is being formed by the consensus reactor. It hasn\u2019t been finalized through network consensus yet. This means that different nodes in the network may observe different \u201clast commits\u201d when assigning a timestamp to DuplicateVoteEvidence. In turn, different nodes could form DuplicateVoteEvidence objects at the same height but with different timestamps. One DuplicateVoteEvidence object (with one timestamp) will then eventually get finalized in the block, but this means that any DuplicateVoteEvidence with a different timestamp is considered invalid. Any node that formed invalid DuplicateVoteEvidence will continue to propose invalid evidence; its peers may see this, and choose to disconnect from this node. This bug means that double signs are DoS vectors in Tendermint Core v0.34.0-v0.34.2. Tendermint Core v0.34.3 is a security release which fixes this bug. As of v0.34.3, DuplicateVoteEvidence is no longer formed by the consensus reactor; rather, the consensus reactor passes the Votes themselves into the EvidencePool, which is now responsible for forming DuplicateVoteEvidence. The EvidencePool has timestamp info that should be consistent across the network, which means that DuplicateVoteEvidence formed in this reactor should have consistent timestamps. This release changes the API between the consensus and evidence reactors.\n\n- CVE-2021-21328: Vapor is a web framework for Swift. In Vapor before version 4.40.1, there is a DoS attack against anyone who Bootstraps a metrics backend for their Vapor app. The following is the attack vector: 1. send unlimited requests against a vapor instance with different paths. this will create unlimited counters and timers, which will eventually drain the system. 2. downstream services might suffer from this attack as well by being spammed with error paths. This has been patched in 4.40.1. The `DefaultResponder` will rewrite any undefined route paths for to `vapor_route_undefined` to avoid unlimited counters.\n\n- CVE-2021-21369: Hyperledger Besu is an open-source, MainNet compatible, Ethereum client written in Java. In Besu before version 1.5.1 there is a denial-of-service vulnerability involving the HTTP JSON-RPC API service. If username and password authentication is enabled for the HTTP JSON-RPC API service, then prior to making any requests to an API endpoint the requestor must use the login endpoint to obtain a JSON web token (JWT) using their credentials. A single user can readily overload the login endpoint with invalid requests (incorrect password). As the supplied password is checked for validity on the main vertx event loop and takes a relatively long time this can cause the processing of other valid requests to fail. A valid username is required for this vulnerability to be exposed. This has been fixed in version 1.5.1.\n\n- CVE-2021-21529: Dell System Update (DSU) 1.9 and earlier versions contain a denial of service vulnerability. A local authenticated malicious user with low privileges may potentially exploit this vulnerability to cause the system to run out of memory by running multiple instances of the vulnerable application.\n\n- CVE-2021-21728: A ZTE product has a configuration error vulnerability.

In vulnerable versions of indy-node, an attacker can max out the number of client connections allowed by the ledger, leaving the ledger unable to be used for its intended purpose. However, the ledger content will not be impacted and the ledger will resume functioning after the attack. This attack exploits the trade-off between resilience and availability. Any protection against abusive client connections will also prevent the network being accessed by certain legitimate users. As a result, validator nodes must tune their firewall rules to ensure the right trade-off for their network's expected users. The guidance to network operators for the use of firewall rules in the deployment of Indy networks has been modified to better protect against denial of service attacks by increasing the cost and complexity in mounting such attacks. The mitigation for this vulnerability is not in the Hyperledger Indy code per se, but rather in the individual deployments of Indy.

Kubernetes and crictl can both be configured to use containerd's CRI implementation; `ExecSync` may be used when running probes or when executing processes via an \"exec\" facility. This bug has been fixed in containerd 1.6.6 and 1.5.13. Users should update to these versions to resolve the issue. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that only trusted images and commands are used.\n\n- CVE-2022-31073: KubeEdge is an open source system for extending native containerized application orchestration capabilities to hosts at Edge. Prior to versions 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4, the ServiceBus server on the edge side may be susceptible to a DoS attack if an HTTP request containing a very large Body is sent to it. It is possible for the node to be exhausted of memory. The consequence of the exhaustion is that other services on the node, e.g. other containers, will be unable to allocate memory and thus causing a denial of service. Malicious apps accidentally pulled by users on the host and have the access to send HTTP requests to localhost may make an attack. It will be affected only when users enable the `ServiceBus` module in the config file `edgecore.yaml`. This bug has been fixed in Kubeedge 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4. As a workaround, disable the `ServiceBus` module in the config file `edgecore.yaml`.\n\n- CVE-2022-31074: KubeEdge is an open source system for extending native containerized application orchestration capabilities to hosts at Edge. Prior to versions 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4, several endpoints in the Cloud AdmissionController may be susceptible to a DoS attack if an HTTP request containing a very large Body is sent to it. The consequence of the exhaustion is that the Cloud AdmissionController will be in denial of service. This bug has been fixed in Kubeedge 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4. There is currently no known workaround.\n\n- CVE-2022-3283: A potential DOS vulnerability was discovered in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions before before 15.2.5, all versions starting from 15.3 before 15.3.4, all versions starting from 15.4 before 15.4.1 While cloning an issue with special crafted content added to the description could have been used to trigger high CPU usage.\n\n- CVE-2022-33203: In BIG-IP Versions 16.1.x before 16.1.3, 15.1.x before 15.1.6.1, and 14.1.x before 14.1.5, when a BIG-IP APM access policy with Service Connect agent is configured on a virtual server, undisclosed requests can cause an increase in memory resource utilization.

Note: Software versions which have reached End of Technical Support (EoTS) are not evaluated.\n\n- CVE-2022-35241: In versions 2.x before 2.3.1 and all versions of 1.x, when NGINX Instance Manager is in use, undisclosed requests can cause an increase in disk resource utilization. Note: Software versions which have reached End of Technical Support (EoTS) are not evaluated.\n\n- CVE-2022-3639: A potential DOS vulnerability was discovered in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions from 10.8 before 15.1.6, all versions starting from 15.2 before 15.2.4, all versions starting from 15.3 before 15.3.2. Improper data handling on branch creation could have been used to trigger high CPU usage.\n\n- CVE-2022-3818: An uncontrolled resource consumption issue when parsing URLs in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions prior to 15.3.5, 15.4 prior to 15.4.4, and 15.5 prior to 15.5.2 allows an attacker to cause performance issues and potentially a denial of service on the GitLab instance.\n\n- CVE-2022-39278: Istio is an open platform-independent service mesh that provides traffic management, policy enforcement, and telemetry collection. Prior to versions 1.15.2, 1.14.5, and 1.13.9, the Istio control plane, istiod, is vulnerable to a request processing error, allowing a malicious attacker that sends a specially crafted or oversized message which results in the control plane crashing when the Kubernetes validating or mutating webhook service is exposed publicly. This endpoint is served over TLS port 15017, but does not require any authentication from the attacker. For simple installations, Istiod is typically only reachable from within the cluster, limiting the blast radius. However, for some deployments, especially external istiod topologies, this port is exposed over the public internet. Versions 1.15.2, 1.14.5, and 1.13.9 contain patches for this issue. There are no effective workarounds, beyond upgrading. This bug is due to an error in `regexp.Compile` in Go.\n\n- CVE-2022-39330: Nextcloud Server is the file server software for Nextcloud, a self-hosted productivity platform. Nextcloud Server prior to versions 23.0.10 and 24.0.6 and Nextcloud Enterprise Server prior to versions 22.2.10, 23.0.10, and 24.0.6 are vulnerable to a logged-in attacker slowing down the system by generating a lot of database/cpu load. Nextcloud Server versions 23.0.10 and 24.0.6 and Nextcloud Enterprise Server versions 22.2.10, 23.0.10, and 24.0.6 contain patches for this issue. As a workaround, disable the Circles app.\n\n- CVE-2022-40735: The Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement Protocol allows use of long exponents that arguably make certain calculations unnecessarily expensive, because the 1996 van Oorschot and Wiener paper found that \"(appropriately) short exponents\" can be used when there are adequate subgroup constraints, and these short exponents can lead to less expensive calculations than for long exponents. This issue is different from CVE-2002-20001 because it is based on an observation about exponent size, rather than an observation about numbers that are not public keys. The specific situations in which calculation expense would constitute a server-side vulnerability depend on the protocol (e.g., TLS, SSH, or IKE) and the DHE implementation details. In general, there might be an availability concern because of server-side resource consumption from DHE modular-exponentiation calculations. Finally, it is possible for an attacker to exploit this vulnerability and CVE-2002-20001 together.\n\n- CVE-2022-41770: In BIG-IP versions 17.0.x before 17.0.0.1, 16.1.x before 16.1.3.1, 15.1.x before 15.1.7, 14.1.x before 14.1.5.1, and all versions of 13.1.x, and BIG-IQ all versions of 8.x and 7.x, an authenticated iControl REST user can cause an increase in memory resource utilization, via undisclosed requests.\n\n- CVE-2022-41806: In versions 16.1.x before 16.1.3.2 and 15.1.x before 15.1.5.1, when BIG-IP AFM Network Address Translation policy with IPv6/IPv4 translation rules is configured on a virtual server, undisclosed requests can cause an increase in memory resource utilization.\n\n- CVE-2022-41833: In all BIG-IP 13.1.x versions, when an iRule containing the HTTP::collect command is configured on a virtual server, undisclosed requests can cause Traffic Management Microkernel (TMM) to terminate.\n\n- CVE-2022-4344: Memory exhaustion in the Kafka protocol dissector in Wireshark 4.0.0 to 4.0.1 and 3.6.0 to 3.6.9 allows denial of service via packet injection or crafted capture file\n\n- CVE-2022-20692: A vulnerability in the NETCONF over SSH feature of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow a low-privileged, authenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service condition (DoS) on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient resource management. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by initiating a large number of NETCONF over SSH connections.

A vulnerability in which custom variables are exposed to unauthorized users exists between versions 2.0.0 and 2.8.2. Custom variables are user-defined keys and values on configuration objects in Icinga 2. These are commonly used to reference secrets in other configurations such as check commands to be able to authenticate with a service being checked. Icinga Web 2 displays these custom variables to logged in users with access to said hosts or services. In order to protect the secrets from being visible to anyone, it's possible to setup protection rules and blacklists in a user's role. Protection rules result in `***` being shown instead of the original value, the key will remain. Backlists will hide a custom variable entirely from the user. Besides using the UI, custom variables can also be accessed differently by using an undocumented URL parameter. By adding a parameter to the affected routes, Icinga Web 2 will show these columns additionally in the respective list. This parameter is also respected when exporting to JSON or CSV. Protection rules and blacklists however have no effect in this case. Custom variables are shown as-is in the result. The issue has been fixed in the 2.9.0, 2.8.3, and 2.7.5 releases. As a workaround, one may set up a restriction to hide hosts and services with the custom variable in question.\n\n- CVE-2020-27831: A flaw was found in Red Hat Quay, where it does not properly protect the authorization token when authorizing email addresses for repository email notifications.

In wire-server from version 2021-02-16 and before version 2021-03-02, the client metadata of all users was exposed in the `GET /users/list-clients` endpoint. The endpoint could be used by any logged in user who could request client details of any other user (no connection required) as far as they can find their User ID. The exposed metadata included id, class, type, location, time, and cookie. A user on a Wire backend could use this endpoint to find registration time and location for each device for a given list of users. As a workaround, remove `/list-clients` from nginx config. This has been fixed in version 2021-03-02.\n\n- CVE-2021-21400: wire-webapp is an open-source front end for Wire, a secure collaboration platform. In wire-webapp before version 2021-03-15-production.0, when being prompted to enter the app-lock passphrase, the typed passphrase will be sent into the most recently used chat when the user does not actively give focus to the input field. Input element focus is enforced programatically in version 2021-03-15-production.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-21621: Jenkins Support Core Plugin 2.72 and earlier provides the serialized user authentication as part of the \"About user (basic authentication details only)\" information, which can include the session ID of the user creating the support bundle in some configurations.\n\n- CVE-2021-21733: The management system of ZXCDN is impacted by the information leak vulnerability.

Prior to version 4.10.4, for regular (non-LiveQuery) queries, the session token is removed from the response, but for LiveQuery payloads it is currently not. If a user has a LiveQuery subscription on the `Parse.User` class, all session tokens created during user sign-ups will be broadcast as part of the LiveQuery payload. A patch in version 4.10.4 removes session tokens from the LiveQuery payload. As a workaround, set `user.acl(new Parse.ACL())` in a beforeSave trigger to make the user private already on sign-up.\n\n- CVE-2021-41125: Scrapy is a high-level web crawling and scraping framework for Python. If you use `HttpAuthMiddleware` (i.e. the `http_user` and `http_pass` spider attributes) for HTTP authentication, all requests will expose your credentials to the request target. This includes requests generated by Scrapy components, such as `robots.txt` requests sent by Scrapy when the `ROBOTSTXT_OBEY` setting is set to `True`, or as requests reached through redirects. Upgrade to Scrapy 2.5.1 and use the new `http_auth_domain` spider attribute to control which domains are allowed to receive the configured HTTP authentication credentials. If you are using Scrapy 1.8 or a lower version, and upgrading to Scrapy 2.5.1 is not an option, you may upgrade to Scrapy 1.8.1 instead. If you cannot upgrade, set your HTTP authentication credentials on a per-request basis, using for example the `w3lib.http.basic_auth_header` function to convert your credentials into a value that you can assign to the `Authorization` header of your request, instead of defining your credentials globally using `HttpAuthMiddleware`.\n\n- CVE-2021-42089: An issue was discovered in Zammad before 4.1.1. The REST API discloses sensitive information.\n\n- CVE-2021-0602: In onCreateOptionsMenu of WifiNetworkDetailsFragment.java, there is a possible way for guest users to view and modify Wi-Fi settings for all configured APs due to a permissions bypass.

When the scs-library-client is used to pull a container image, with authentication, the HTTP Authorization header sent by the client to the library service may be incorrectly leaked to an S3 backing storage provider. This occurs in a specific flow, where the library service redirects the client to a backing S3 storage server, to perform a multi-part concurrent download. Depending on site configuration, the S3 service may be provided by a third party. An attacker with access to the S3 service may be able to extract user credentials, allowing them to impersonate the user. The vulnerable multi-part concurrent download flow, with redirect to S3, is only used when communicating with a Singularity Enterprise 1.x installation, or third party server implementing this flow. Interaction with Singularity Enterprise 2.x, and Singularity Container Services (cloud.sylabs.io), does not trigger the vulnerable flow. We encourage all users to update. Users who interact with a Singularity Enterprise 1.x installation, using a 3rd party S3 storage service, are advised to revoke and recreate their authentication tokens within Singularity Enterprise. There is no workaround available at this time.\n\n- CVE-2022-31130: Grafana is an open source observability and data visualization platform. Versions of Grafana for endpoints prior to 9.1.8 and 8.5.14 could leak authentication tokens to some destination plugins under some conditions. The vulnerability impacts data source and plugin proxy endpoints with authentication tokens. The destination plugin could receive a user's Grafana authentication token. Versions 9.1.8 and 8.5.14 contain a patch for this issue. As a workaround, do not use API keys, JWT authentication, or any HTTP Header based authentication.\n\n- CVE-2022-42132: The Test LDAP Users functionality in Liferay Portal 7.0.0 through 7.4.3.4, and Liferay DXP 7.0 fix pack 102 and earlier, 7.1 before fix pack 27, 7.2 before fix pack 17, 7.3 before update 4, and DXP 7.4 GA includes the LDAP credential in the page URL when paginating through the list of users, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers or attackers with access to the request logs to see the LDAP credential.\n\n- CVE-2022-31746: Internal URLs are protected by a secret UUID key, which could have been leaked to web page through the Referrer header.

There are currently no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-31069: NestJS Proxy is a NestJS module to decorate and proxy calls. Prior to version 0.7.0, the nestjs-proxy library did not have a way to control when Authorization headers should should be forwarded for specific backend services configured by the application developer. This could have resulted in sensitive information such as OAuth bearer access tokens being inadvertently exposed to such services that should not see them. A new feature has been introduced in the patched version of nestjs-proxy that allows application developers to opt out of forwarding the Authorization headers on a per service basis using the `forwardToken` config setting. Developers are advised to review the README for this library on Github or NPM for further details on how this configuration can be applied. This issue has been fixed in version 0.7.0 of `@finastra/nestjs-proxy`. Users of `@ffdc/nestjs-proxy` are advised that this package has been deprecated and is no longer being maintained or receiving updates. Such users should update their package.json file to use `@finastra/nestjs-proxy` instead.\n\n- CVE-2022-31070: NestJS Proxy is a NestJS module to decorate and proxy calls. Prior to version 0.7.0, the nestjs-proxy library did not have a way to block sensitive cookies (e.g. session cookies) from being forwarded to backend services configured by the application developer. This could have led to sensitive cookies being inadvertently exposed to such services that should not see them. The patched version now blocks cookies from being forwarded by default. However developers can configure an allow-list of cookie names by using the `allowedCookies` config setting. This issue has been fixed in version 0.7.0 of `@finastra/nestjs-proxy`. Users of `@ffdc/nestjs-proxy` are advised that this package has been deprecated and is no longer being maintained or receiving updates. Such users should update their package.json file to use `@finastra/nestjs-proxy` instead.\n\n- CVE-2022-3348: Just like in the previous report, an attacker could steal the account of different users. But in this case, it's a little bit more specific, because it is needed to be an editor in the same app as the victim.\n\n- CVE-2022-38113: This vulnerability discloses build and services versions in the server response header. \n\n- CVE-2022-46150: Discourse is an open-source discussion platform. Prior to version 2.8.13 of the `stable` branch and version 2.9.0.beta14 of the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches, unauthorized users may learn of the existence of hidden tags and that they have been applied to topics that they have access to. This issue is patched in version 2.8.13 of the `stable` branch and version 2.9.0.beta14 of the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches. As a workaround, use the `disable_email` site setting to disable all emails to non-staff users.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-200 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-209 (CanAlsoBe)\n\n- CWE-202 (CanAlsoBe)",

An x86 PV guest can trigger a host OS crash when handling guest access to MSR_MISC_ENABLE. When a guest accesses certain Model Specific Registers, Xen first reads the value from hardware to use as the basis for auditing the guest access. For the MISC_ENABLE MSR, which is an Intel specific MSR, this MSR read is performed without error handling for a #GP fault, which is the consequence of trying to read this MSR on non-Intel hardware. A buggy or malicious PV guest administrator can crash Xen, resulting in a host Denial of Service. Only x86 systems are vulnerable. ARM systems are not vulnerable. Only Xen versions 4.11 and onwards are vulnerable. 4.10 and earlier are not vulnerable. Only x86 systems that do not implement the MISC_ENABLE MSR (0x1a0) are vulnerable. AMD and Hygon systems do not implement this MSR and are vulnerable. Intel systems do implement this MSR and are not vulnerable. Other manufacturers have not been checked. Only x86 PV guests can exploit the vulnerability. x86 HVM/PVH guests cannot exploit the vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2020-5387: Dell XPS 13 9370 BIOS versions prior to 1.13.1 contains an Improper Exception Handling vulnerability.

Continued receipt and processing of the BGP update will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition. This issue affects very specific versions of Juniper Networks Junos OS: 19.3R3-S2; 19.4R3-S3; 20.2 versions 20.2R2-S3 and later, prior to 20.2R3-S2; 20.3 versions 20.3R2 and later, prior to 20.3R3; 20.4 versions 20.4R2 and later, prior to 20.4R3; 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R2. Juniper Networks Junos OS 20.1 is not affected by this issue. This issue also affects Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved: All versions prior to 20.4R2-S3-EVO, 20.4R3-EVO; 21.1-EVO versions prior to 21.1R2-EVO; 21.2-EVO versions prior to 21.2R2-EVO.\n\n- CVE-2021-33486: All versions of the CODESYS V3 Runtime Toolkit for VxWorks from version V3.5.8.0 and before version V3.5.17.10 have Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions.\n\n- CVE-2020-5403: Reactor Netty HttpServer, versions 0.9.3 and 0.9.4, is exposed to a URISyntaxException that causes the connection to be closed prematurely instead of producing a 400 response.\n\n- CVE-2020-25597: An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. There is mishandling of the constraint that once-valid event channels may not turn invalid. Logic in the handling of event channel operations in Xen assumes that an event channel, once valid, will not become invalid over the life time of a guest. However, operations like the resetting of all event channels may involve decreasing one of the bounds checked when determining validity. This may lead to bug checks triggering, crashing the host. An unprivileged guest may be able to crash Xen, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) for the entire system. All Xen versions from 4.4 onwards are vulnerable. Xen versions 4.3 and earlier are not vulnerable. Only systems with untrusted guests permitted to create more than the default number of event channels are vulnerable. This number depends on the architecture and type of guest. For 32-bit x86 PV guests, this is 1023; for 64-bit x86 PV guests, and for all ARM guests, this number is 4095. Systems where untrusted guests are limited to fewer than this number are not vulnerable. Note that xl and libxl limit max_event_channels to 1023 by default, so systems using exclusively xl, libvirt+libxl, or their own toolstack based on libxl, and not explicitly setting max_event_channels, are not vulnerable.\n\n- CVE-2020-7693: Incorrect handling of Upgrade header with the value websocket leads in crashing of containers hosting sockjs apps.

The vulnerability arises due to unsafe usage of the logo_uri parameter in the Dynamic Client Registration request. An unauthenticated attacker can make a HTTP request from the vulnerable server to any address in the internal network and obtain its response (which might, for example, have a JavaScript payload for resultant XSS). The issue can be exploited to bypass network boundaries, obtain sensitive data, or attack other hosts in the internal network.\n\n- CVE-2021-27214: A Server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the ProductConfig servlet in Zoho ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus through 6013 allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to perform blind HTTP requests or perform a Cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against the administrative interface via an HTTP request, a different vulnerability than CVE-2019-3905.\n\n- CVE-2021-21287: MinIO is a High Performance Object Storage released under Apache License v2.0. In MinIO before version RELEASE.2021-01-30T00-20-58Z there is a server-side request forgery vulnerability. The target application may have functionality for importing data from a URL, publishing data to a URL, or otherwise reading data from a URL that can be tampered with. The attacker modifies the calls to this functionality by supplying a completely different URL or by manipulating how URLs are built (path traversal etc.). In a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack, the attacker can abuse functionality on the server to read or update internal resources. The attacker can supply or modify a URL which the code running on the server will read or submit data, and by carefully selecting the URLs, the attacker may be able to read server configuration such as AWS metadata, connect to internal services like HTTP enabled databases, or perform post requests towards internal services which are not intended to be exposed. This is fixed in version RELEASE.2021-01-30T00-20-58Z, all users are advised to upgrade. As a workaround you can disable the browser front-end with \"MINIO_BROWSER=off\" environment variable.\n\n- CVE-2021-39303: The server in Jamf Pro before 10.32.0 has an SSRF vulnerability, aka PI-006352. NOTE: Jamf Nation will also publish an article about this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2021-40091: An SSRF issue was discovered in SquaredUp for SCOM 5.2.1.6654.\n\n- CVE-2021-43780: Redash is a package for data visualization and sharing. In versions 10.0 and priorm the implementation of URL-loading data sources like JSON, CSV, or Excel is vulnerable to advanced methods of Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). These vulnerabilities are only exploitable on installations where a URL-loading data source is enabled. As of time of publication, the `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches address this by applying the Advocate library for making http requests instead of the requests library directly. Users should upgrade to version 10.0.1 to receive this patch. There are a few workarounds for mitigating the vulnerability without upgrading. One can disable the vulnerable data sources entirely, by adding the following env variable to one's configuration, making them unavailable inside the webapp. One can switch any data source of certain types (viewable in the GitHub Security Advisory) to be `View Only` for all groups on the Settings > Groups > Data Sources screen. For users unable to update an admin may modify Redash's configuration through environment variables to mitigate this issue. Depending on the version of Redash, an admin may also need to run a CLI command to re-encrypt some fields in the database. The `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches as of time of publication have removed the default value for `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET`. All future releases will also require this to be set explicitly. For existing installations, one will need to ensure that explicit values are set for the `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET` and `REDASH_SECRET_KEY `variables.\n\n- CVE-2021-27561: Yealink Device Management (DM) 3.6.0.20 allows command injection as root via the /sm/api/v1/firewall/zone/services URI, without authentication.\n\n- CVE-2021-29475: HedgeDoc (formerly known as CodiMD) is an open-source collaborative markdown editor. An attacker is able to receive arbitrary files from the file system when exporting a note to PDF. Since the code injection has to take place as note content, there fore this exploit requires the attackers ability to modify a note. This will affect all instances, which have pdf export enabled. This issue has been fixed by https://github.com/hedgedoc/hedgedoc/commit/c1789474020a6d668d616464cb2da5e90e123f65 and is available in version 1.5.0. Starting the CodiMD/HedgeDoc instance with `CMD_ALLOW_PDF_EXPORT=false` or set `\"allowPDFExport\": false` in config.json can mitigate this issue for those who cannot upgrade. This exploit works because while PhantomJS doesn't actually render the `file:///` references to the PDF file itself, it still uses them internally, and exfiltration is possible, and easy through JavaScript rendering. The impact is pretty bad, as the attacker is able to read the CodiMD/HedgeDoc `config.json` file as well any other files on the filesystem. Even though the suggested Docker deploy option doesn't have many interesting files itself, the `config.json` still often contains sensitive information, database credentials, and maybe OAuth secrets among other things.\n\n- CVE-2021-45968: An issue was discovered in xmppserver jar in the XMPP Server component of the JIve platform, as used in Pascom Cloud Phone System before 7.20.x (and in other products).

In versions prior to 1.3.0 there exists a DoS vulnerability that is possible due to a bug in the library that would allow an attacker with specifically designed queries to cause stack overflow panics. Any user with access to the GraphQL handler can send these queries and cause stack overflows. This in turn could potentially compromise the ability of the server to serve data to its users. The issue has been patched in version `v1.3.0`. The only known workaround for this issue is to disable the `graphql.MaxDepth` option from your schema which is not recommended.\n\n- CVE-2022-23591: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The `GraphDef` format in TensorFlow does not allow self recursive functions. The runtime assumes that this invariant is satisfied. However, a `GraphDef` containing a fragment such as the following can be consumed when loading a `SavedModel`. This would result in a stack overflow during execution as resolving each `NodeDef` means resolving the function itself and its nodes. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2022-24675: encoding/pem in Go before 1.17.9 and 1.18.x before 1.18.1 has a Decode stack overflow via a large amount of PEM data.\n\n- CVE-2022-31019: Vapor is a server-side Swift HTTP web framework. When using automatic content decoding an attacker can craft a request body that can make the server crash with the following request: `curl -d \"array[_0][0][array][_0][0][array]$(for f in $(seq 1100); do echo -n '[_0][0][array]'; done)[string][_0]=hello%20world\" http://localhost:8080/foo`. The issue is unbounded, attacker controlled stack growth which will at some point lead to a stack overflow and a process crash. This issue has been fixed in version 4.61.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-31099: rulex is a new, portable, regular expression language. When parsing untrusted rulex expressions, the stack may overflow, possibly enabling a Denial of Service attack. This happens when parsing an expression with several hundred levels of nesting, causing the process to abort immediately. This is a security concern for you, if your service parses untrusted rulex expressions (expressions provided by an untrusted user), and your service becomes unavailable when the process running rulex aborts due to a stack overflow. The crash is fixed in version **0.4.3**. Affected users are advised to update to this version. There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-3216: A vulnerability has been found in Nintendo Game Boy Color and classified as problematic.

Versions prior to 1.4.20 may allow a remote attacker to terminate the application with a stack overflow error, resulting in a denial of service only via manipulation the processed input stream. The attack uses the hash code implementation for collections and maps to force recursive hash calculation causing a stack overflow. This issue is patched in version 1.4.20 which handles the stack overflow and raises an InputManipulationException instead. A potential workaround for users who only use HashMap or HashSet and whose XML refers these only as default map or set, is to change the default implementation of java.util.Map and java.util per the code example in the referenced advisory. However, this implies that your application does not care about the implementation of the map and all elements are comparable.\n\n- CVE-2022-47662: GPAC MP4Box 2.1-DEV-rev649-ga8f438d20 has a segment fault (/stack overflow) due to infinite recursion in Media_GetSample isomedia/media.c:662\n\n- CVE-2022-23460: Jsonxx or Json++ is a JSON parser, writer and reader written in C++.

        "matched_text": "CWE-1286: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input\n\nType: Base\n\nStatus: Incomplete\n\nDescription:\n\nThe product receives input that is expected to be well-formed - i.e., to comply with a certain syntax - but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input complies with the syntax.\n\nExtended Details:\n\n\n\nOften, complex inputs are expected to follow a particular syntax, which is either assumed by the input itself, or declared within metadata such as headers. The syntax could be for data exchange formats, markup languages, or even programming languages. When untrusted input is not properly validated for the expected syntax, attackers could cause parsing failures, trigger unexpected errors, or expose latent vulnerabilities that might not be directly exploitable if the input had conformed to the syntax.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2016-4029: Chain: incorrect validation of intended decimal-based IP address format (CWE-1286) enables parsing of octal or hexadecimal formats (CWE-1389), allowing bypass of an SSRF protection mechanism (CWE-918).\n\n- CVE-2007-5893: HTTP request with missing protocol version number leads to crash\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-33195: Go before 1.15.13 and 1.16.x before 1.16.5 has functions for DNS lookups that do not validate replies from DNS servers, and thus a return value may contain an unsafe injection (e.g., XSS) that does not conform to the RFC1035 format.\n\n- CVE-2021-21705: In PHP versions 7.3.x below 7.3.29, 7.4.x below 7.4.21 and 8.0.x below 8.0.8, when using URL validation functionality via filter_var() function with FILTER_VALIDATE_URL parameter, an URL with invalid password field can be accepted as valid. This can lead to the code incorrectly parsing the URL and potentially leading to other security implications - like contacting a wrong server or making a wrong access decision.\n\n- CVE-2021-23853: In Bosch IP cameras, improper validation of the HTTP header allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTTP headers through crafted URLs.\n\n- CVE-2021-25465: An improper scheme check vulnerability in Samsung Themes prior to version 5.2.01 allows attackers to perform Man-in-the-middle attack.\n\n- CVE-2021-29418: The netmask package before 2.0.1 for Node.js mishandles certain unexpected characters in an IP address string, such as an octal digit of 9. This (in some situations) allows attackers to bypass access control that is based on IP addresses. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2021-28918.\n\n- CVE-2021-45223: An issue was discovered in COINS Construction Cloud 11.12. Due to insufficient input neutralization, it is vulnerable to denial of service attacks via forced server crashes.\n\n- CVE-2021-45687: An issue was discovered in the raw-cpuid crate before 9.1.1 for Rust. If the serialize feature is used (which is not the the default), a Deserialize operation may lack sufficient validation, leading to memory corruption or a panic.\n\n- CVE-2022-22176: An Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input vulnerability in the Juniper DHCP daemon (jdhcpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an adjacent unauthenticated attacker sending a malformed DHCP packet to cause a crash of jdhcpd and thereby a Denial of Service (DoS). If option-82 is configured in a DHCP snooping / -security scenario, jdhcpd crashes if a specific malformed DHCP request packet is received. The DHCP functionality is impacted while jdhcpd restarts, and continued exploitation of the vulnerability will lead to the unavailability of the DHCP service and thereby a sustained DoS. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS 13.2 version 13.2R1 and later versions prior to 15.1R7-S11; 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R3-S6; 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R2-S9, 18.4R3-S10; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R2-S3, 19.1R3-S7; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S8, 19.2R3-S4; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R2-S7, 19.3R3-S4; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R3-S6; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R3-S3; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R3-S3; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R3-S1; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R3; 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R2-S1, 21.1R3; 21.2 versions prior to 21.2R1-S1, 21.2R2. This issue does not affect Juniper Networks Junos OS version 12.3R12 and prior versions.\n\n- CVE-2022-22192: An Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input vulnerability in the kernel of Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved on PTX series allows a network-based, unauthenticated attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS). When an incoming TCP packet destined to the device is malformed there is a possibility of a kernel panic. Only TCP packets destined to the ports for BGP, LDP and MSDP can trigger this. This issue only affects PTX10004, PTX10008, PTX10016. No other PTX Series devices or other platforms are affected. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved: 20.4-EVO versions prior to 20.4R3-S4-EVO; 21.3-EVO versions prior to 21.3R3-EVO; 21.4-EVO versions prior to 21.4R3-EVO; 22.1-EVO versions prior to 22.1R2-EVO. This issue does not affect Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved versions prior to 20.4R1-EVO.\n\n- CVE-2022-45113: Improper validation of syntactic correctness of input vulnerability exist in Movable Type series. Having a user to access a specially crafted URL may allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to set a specially crafted URL to the Reset Password page and conduct a phishing attack. Affected products/versions are as follows: Movable Type 7 r.5301 and earlier (Movable Type 7 Series), Movable Type Advanced 7 r.5301 and earlier (Movable Type Advanced 7 Series), Movable Type 6.8.7 and earlier (Movable Type 6 Series), Movable Type Advanced 6.8.7 and earlier (Movable Type Advanced 6 Series), Movable Type Premium 1.53 and earlier, and Movable Type Premium Advanced 1.53 and earlier.\n\n- CVE-2021-40017: The HW_KEYMASTER module lacks the validity check of the key format. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may result in out-of-bounds memory access.\n\n- CVE-2022-1941: A parsing vulnerability for the MessageSet type in the ProtocolBuffers versions prior to and including 3.16.1, 3.17.3, 3.18.2, 3.19.4, 3.20.1 and 3.21.5 for protobuf-cpp, and versions prior to and including 3.16.1, 3.17.3, 3.18.2, 3.19.4, 3.20.1 and 4.21.5 for protobuf-python can lead to out of memory failures. A specially crafted message with multiple key-value per elements creates parsing issues, and can lead to a Denial of Service against services receiving unsanitized input. We recommend upgrading to versions 3.18.3, 3.19.5, 3.20.2, 3.21.6 for protobuf-cpp and 3.18.3, 3.19.5, 3.20.2, 4.21.6 for protobuf-python. Versions for 3.16 and 3.17 are no longer updated.\n\n- CVE-2022-39376: GLPI stands for Gestionnaire Libre de Parc Informatique. GLPI is a Free Asset and IT Management Software package that provides ITIL Service Desk features, licenses tracking and software auditing. Users may be able to inject custom fields values in `mailto` links. This issue has been patched, please upgrade to version 10.0.4. There are currently no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-40277: Joplin version 2.8.8 allows an external attacker to execute arbitrary commands remotely on any client that opens a link in a malicious markdown file, via Joplin. This is possible because the application does not properly validate the schema/protocol of existing links in the markdown file before passing them to the 'shell.openExternal' function.\n\n- CVE-2022-41908: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. An input `token` that is not a UTF-8 bytestring will trigger a `CHECK` fail in `tf.raw_ops.PyFunc`. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 9f03a9d3bafe902c1e6beb105b2f24172f238645. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.11. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.10.1, 2.9.3, and TensorFlow 2.8.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2022-1431: An issue has been discovered in GitLab affecting all versions starting from 12.10 before 14.8.6, all versions starting from 14.9 before 14.9.4, all versions starting from 14.10 before 14.10.1. GitLab was not correctly handling malicious requests to the PyPi API endpoint allowing the attacker to cause uncontrolled resource consumption.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-20 (ChildOf)",

          "extended_description": "\n\nCross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:\n\n\n  1. Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.\n\n  1. The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.\n\n  1. During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.\n\n  1. A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.\n\n  1. Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.\n\n  1. This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.\n\nThere are three main kinds of XSS:\n\n  -  **Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent)**  - The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.\n\n  -  **Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent)**  - The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs. \n\n  -  **Type 0: DOM-Based XSS**  - In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible. \n\nOnce the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"\n\nIn many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.\n",

The key would typically identify a user-related record stored in the system and would be used to lookup that record for presentation to the user. It is likely that an attacker would have to be an authenticated user in the system. However, the authorization process would not properly check the data access operation to ensure that the authenticated user performing the operation has sufficient entitlements to perform the requested data access, hence bypassing any other authorization checks present in the system.\n\n\nFor example, attackers can look at places where user specific data is retrieved (e.g. search screens) and determine whether the key for the item being looked up is controllable externally. The key may be a hidden field in the HTML form field, might be passed as a URL parameter or as an unencrypted cookie variable, then in each of these cases it will be possible to tamper with the key value.\n\n\nOne manifestation of this weakness is when a system uses sequential or otherwise easily-guessable session IDs that would allow one user to easily switch to another user's session and read/modify their data.\n",

The process of removal is sometimes called cleansing or scrubbing.\n\n\nFor example, a product for editing documents might not remove sensitive data such as reviewer comments or the local pathname where the document is stored.
