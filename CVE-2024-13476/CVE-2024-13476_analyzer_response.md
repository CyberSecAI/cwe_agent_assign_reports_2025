# Raw Analyzer Response for CVE-2024-13476

# Summary

| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-89 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE: The vulnerability description explicitly states that the plugin is vulnerable to SQL Injection due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that influenced the selection was the direct match of the vulnerability description to the characteristics of CWE-89. The description clearly indicates that the vulnerability is due to **insufficient neutralization of special elements used in an SQL command**, which aligns perfectly with the definition of CWE-89. The retriever results also strongly suggested CWE-89 as the top candidate.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain is straightforward:

1.  **Root Cause:** **Insufficient escaping and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query** within the `engtz_wd_save_dropship` AJAX endpoint.
2.  **Weakness:** Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') - CWE-89.
3.  **Impact:** Unauthenticated attackers can extract sensitive information from the database.

## Summary of Analysis
The assessment is based on the explicit statement in the vulnerability description, which points to SQL injection caused by **insufficient escaping and lack of sufficient preparation** in the SQL query.

The key phrase "*insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query*" directly maps to CWE-89, which involves the failure to neutralize special elements in an SQL command.

The selection of CWE-89 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly represents the root cause of the vulnerability as described.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
**Abstraction Level**: Compound
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.



## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-96: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Statically Saved Code ('Static Code Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes code syntax before inserting the input into an executable resource, such as a library, configuration file, or template.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-95: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes code syntax before using the input in a dynamic evaluation call (e.g. "eval").

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently ensuring that the resulting data will be valid.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-790: Improper Filtering of Special Elements
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives data from an upstream component, but does not filter or incorrectly filters special elements before sending it to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component. Without sufficient removal or quoting of SQL syntax in user-controllable inputs, the generated SQL query can cause those inputs to be interpreted as SQL instead of ordinary user data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 774.55
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.
