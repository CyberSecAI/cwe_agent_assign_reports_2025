## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The content relates to CVE-2025-4311. Here's the extracted information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

* A SQL injection vulnerability was found in the '/admin/update\_main\_topic\_img.php?topic\_id=529' file of the 'Content Management System' project. The reason for this issue is that attackers inject malicious code from the parameter 'stopic\_id' and use it directly in SQL queries without the need for appropriate cleaning or validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

* SQL injection

**Impact of exploitation:**

* Attackers can exploit this SQL injection vulnerability to achieve unauthorized database access, sensitive data leakage, data tampering, comprehensive system control, and even service interruption.

**Attack vectors:**

* The '/admin/update\_main\_topic\_img.php?topic\_id=529' file is vulnerable. The 'stopic\_id' parameter is the entry point for the attack.
* No login or authorization is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*  An attacker needs to be able to craft malicious SQL queries and send them via the 'stopic\_id' parameter. No authentication is required.

**Mitigation or fix:**

* Use prepared statements and parameter binding.
* Input validation and filtering.
* Minimize database user permissions.
* Regular security audits.

**Payload examples (from sqlmap output):**

*   `topic_id=529' AND EXTRACTVALUE(9810,CASE WHEN (9810=9810) THEN 9810 ELSE 0x3A END)-- GZfh`
*   `topic_id=529' AND GTID_SUBSET(CONCAT(0x7171767671,(SELECT (ELT(8364=8364,1))),0x71767a6b71),8364)-- cLHD`
*   `topic_id=529' AND (SELECT 1472 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))IDps)-- shUO`
*   `topic_id=-8477' UNION ALL SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL,CONCAT(0x7171767671,0x554a447865686e504b64485965766773477a4c4b4e54534a75475050594273556e41496a79715953,0x71767a6b71),NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL#`
