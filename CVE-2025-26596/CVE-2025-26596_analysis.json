CWE-122 is a variant of buffer overflow where the buffer is allocated in the heap. CWE-131 is chosen as primary because the root cause is the incorrect calculation of the buffer size, not merely the existence of a heap buffer overflow.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe131[\"CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe122[\"CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n\n    cwe131 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe119\n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe131 primary\n    class cwe119,cwe122 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **incorrect calculation of the buffer size** (CWE-131), which leads to an **improper restriction of operations within the bounds of a memory buffer** (CWE-119), ultimately resulting in a **heap-based buffer overflow** (CWE-122).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nBased on the vulnerability description and the provided information, the root cause is the **computation of the length differs**, leading to a **heap overflow**. This directly corresponds to **CWE-131 Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size**, which can lead to **CWE-122 Heap-based Buffer Overflow**.\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"The **computation of the length** in XkbSizeKeySyms() differs from what is written in XkbWriteKeySyms(), which may lead to a heap-based buffer overflow.\" This clearly indicates that the root cause is related to how the length is calculated, making CWE-131 the most appropriate primary CWE.\n\nWhile **CWE-122 Heap-based Buffer Overflow** is a direct consequence and impact of the vulnerability, it is more of a symptom than the root cause. Therefore, it is considered a secondary candidate.\n\nThe selection of CWE-131 is at the optimal level of specificity as it precisely describes the **incorrect calculation** issue, which is the root cause of the vulnerability. Other CWEs considered, such as integer overflows or off-by-one errors, are not as directly relevant to the provided description.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs a calculation that can\n         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic\n         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than\n         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is\n         incremented to a value that is too large to store in the\n         associated representation.
