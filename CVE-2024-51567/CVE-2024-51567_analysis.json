  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-51567:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\nThe root cause is a combination of factors:\n\n1.  **Lack of Centralized Authentication:** CyberPanel implements authentication checks on a per-route basis instead of using a central authentication system/middleware. This leads to inconsistencies and missed checks on some API routes.\n2.  **Command Injection:** User-supplied inputs are not properly sanitized, allowing attackers to inject and execute arbitrary system commands via the `ProcessUtilities.outputExecutioner()` function.\n3.  **Middleware Bypass:** The implemented security middleware only filters POST requests. It can be bypassed by sending requests using other HTTP methods like `OPTIONS` or `PUT`.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Authentication Bypass:** The `upgrademysqlstatus` route in `/dataBases/views.py` lacks authentication checks, allowing unauthenticated users to access it.\n*   **Command Injection:** The `upgrademysqlstatus` function takes a `statusfile` parameter directly from the user and uses it in a command that's executed with root privileges using `sudo`. This enables command injection.\n*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** Input sanitization is not applied to the statusfile parameter used in the `upgrademysqlstatus` function.\n*   **Security Middleware Bypass:** The security middleware is bypassed by using HTTP methods other than `POST`.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can execute arbitrary system commands on the server as root.\n*   **Full System Compromise:** Successful exploitation grants an attacker complete control of the affected server, potentially leading to data theft, data encryption, malware deployment, and denial of service.\n*   **Mass Ransomware Deployment**: As seen in the content, threat actors mass-exploited the vulnerability to deploy PSAUX ransomware.\n*  **Mass Cryptominer deployment**: In some cases, the same vulnerability was used to deploy cryptominers.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **HTTP Request:** Attackers can send a specially crafted HTTP request to the `/dataBases/upgrademysqlstatus` endpoint, using a method other than `POST` (e.g., `PUT`, `OPTIONS`).\n*   **JSON Payload:** The request body contains a JSON payload with the `statusfile` parameter containing the command injection payload.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable CyberPanel instance.\n*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability is pre-authentication, meaning the attacker does not need any valid user credentials.\n*   **HTTP Skills:** The attacker must be able to craft and send HTTP requests with specific methods (e.g., PUT) and JSON payloads.\n\n**Additional details from the provided content**\n*   The vulnerability was discovered by security researcher DreyAnd and reported to the CyberPanel developers.\n*   The developers released a patch in version 2.3.8.\n*  A proof of concept exploit was created and shared which demonstrated root-level remote command execution.\n*   The vulnerability was mass-exploited by the PSAUX ransomware group, causing significant disruption to CyberPanel users.\n*   Other threat actors also used the flaw to deploy other ransomware and cryptominers\n*   A decryptor was made available by LeakIX due to a flaw in the way that the PSAUX ransomware encrypted the files.",

The **command injection** vulnerability is triggered by **improper neutralization** of shell metacharacters in the `statusfile` property.|\n| CWE-306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The `upgrademysqlstatus` route lacks authentication, allowing unauthenticated access. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.95\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship influencing the CWE selection is the parent-child relationship. CWE-78 is a child of CWE-77 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements) and CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')), providing a more specific classification for the OS command injection vulnerability. CWE-306 is a base level CWE with no clear parent child relationship here, but represents the **missing authentication** aspect of the vulnerability. The vulnerability chain starts with **missing authentication** (CWE-306) leading to the **command injection** (CWE-78).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Command ('Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    \n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe306 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe78\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe306 secondary\n    class cwe77,cwe74 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with **missing authentication** for the `upgrademysqlstatus` route (CWE-306). This allows unauthenticated attackers to access the route and inject shell metacharacters into the `statusfile` parameter, which is then used in a command executed with root privileges, resulting in OS command injection (CWE-78).\n\nCWE-306 (Missing Authentication) -> CWE-78 (OS Command Injection) -> Remote Code Execution (Impact)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, specifically the vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary. The key phrases \"bypass authentication and execute arbitrary commands\" and \"shell metacharacters in statusfile property\" clearly indicate both **missing authentication** and **command injection** vulnerabilities. The CVE reference summary confirms the **lack of authentication** on the `upgrademysqlstatus` route and the **improper sanitization** of the `statusfile` parameter leading to command injection.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the selection by highlighting the hierarchical relationship between CWE-78 and its parent CWEs (CWE-77, CWE-74), which supports the choice of CWE-78 as the most specific and appropriate classification for the command injection vulnerability.\n\nCWE-78 and CWE-306 are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly address the root causes of the vulnerability: **improper neutralization** of shell metacharacters and **missing authentication**, respectively. Other CWEs, such as CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) and CWE-862 (Missing Authorization), were considered but deemed less appropriate because CWE-306 directly addresses the complete lack of authentication for the vulnerable route, and the authentication guidance indicates using CWE-306 when there is no login required.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
