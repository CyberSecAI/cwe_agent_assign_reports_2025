# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-37922

# Vulnerability Description

    In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved book3s64/radix Align section vmemmap start address to PAGE_SIZE A vmemmap altmap is a device-provided region used to provide backing storage for struct pages. For each namespace, the altmap should belong to that same namespace. If the namespaces are created unaligned, there is a chance that the section vmemmap start address could also be unaligned. If the section vmemmap start address is unaligned, the altmap page allocated from the current namespace might be used by the previous namespace also. During the free operation, since the altmap is shared between two namespaces, the previous namespace may detect that the page does not belong to its altmap and incorrectly assume that the page is a normal page. It then attempts to free the normal page, which leads to a kernel crash. Kernel attempted to read user page (18) - exploit attempt? (uid 0) BUG **Kernel NULL pointer dereference on read** at 0x00000018 Faulting instruction address 0xc000000000530c7c Oops Kernel access of bad area, sig 11

Relevant CWEs for this WEAKNESS:

### 1. CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') (Score: 930.27)

The product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently....
