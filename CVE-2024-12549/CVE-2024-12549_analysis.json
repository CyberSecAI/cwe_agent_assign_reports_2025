  "description": "Tungsten Automation Power PDF JP2 File Parsing Out-Of-Bounds Read Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Tungsten Automation Power PDF. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of JP2 files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated object. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-25565.",

This **lack of validation** can be classified as CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation). CWE-125 is a Base level CWE, while CWE-20 is a Class level CWE. CWE-20 can lead to various other weaknesses, including out-of-bounds reads. The selection is based on the vulnerability description explicitly mentioning \"out-of-bounds read\" as the issue resulting from the **lack of validation**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n\n    cwe125 -->|CHILD_OF| cwe20\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe125 primary\n    class cwe20 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper input validation** (CWE-20), which leads to an **out-of-bounds read** (CWE-125).

The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated object.\"\n\nThe retriever results and keyphrase analysis consistently point to CWE-125 and CWE-20 as relevant CWEs. While other CWEs like CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) are mentioned, the description explicitly states a read operation is the root cause, making CWE-125 the most accurate primary classification. CWE-20 is a secondary weakness as the **lack of validation** allowed the **out-of-bounds read** to occur.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-125 is a Base level CWE that directly describes the type of memory access issue, while CWE-20 is a Class level CWE representing the **improper input validation** that led to the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n*   CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read - The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n*   CWE-20: Improper Input Validation - The product receives input or data, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input has the properties that are required to process the data safely and correctly.\n```",
