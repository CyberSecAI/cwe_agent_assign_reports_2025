User with a low system privileges can create a set of symlinks inside the C\\\\ProgramData\\\\Cloudflare\\\\warp-diag-partials folder. After triggering the Reset all settings option the WARP service will delete the files that the symlink was pointing to. Given the WARP service operates with System privileges this might lead to deleting files owned by the System user. This issue affects WARP before 2024.12.492.0.
