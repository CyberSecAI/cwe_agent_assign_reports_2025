## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-89 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE. The **root cause** is the **improper neutralization** of special elements in an SQL command. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that influenced the decision was the direct match of the vulnerability description to the CWE-89 description. There were no other relationships needed to arrive at this decision.

```

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain consists of a single step:

1.  **Root Cause:** **Improper neutralization** of special elements used in an SQL command (CWE-89) leading directly to the **SQL Injection**.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis strongly pointed towards CWE-89 due to the clear description of an **SQL injection vulnerability**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary explicitly states that the **root cause** is the **lack of appropriate cleaning or validation** of the 'doctorspecilization' parameter, which is then directly used in SQL queries. The provided payload example further solidifies this assessment. The retriever results also listed CWE-89 as the top match. Therefore, CWE-89 is the most appropriate and specific classification.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.81
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component. Without sufficient removal or quoting of SQL syntax in user-controllable inputs, the generated SQL query can cause those inputs to be interpreted as SQL instead of ordinary user data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The content relates to CVE-2025-5362. Here's the extracted information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   A SQL injection vulnerability was found in the '/hms/admin/doctor-specilization.php' file of the 'Online Hospital Management System' project. The reason for this issue is that attackers inject malicious code from the parameter 'doctorspecilization' and use it directly in SQL queries without the need for appropriate cleaning or validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   SQL injection

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Attackers can exploit this SQL injection vulnerability to achieve unauthorized database access, sensitive data leakage, data tampering, comprehensive system control, and even service interruption.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The '/hms/admin/doctor-specilization.php' file is vulnerable via the 'doctorspecilization' parameter.
*   No login or authorization is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable file. No authentication is required.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   Use prepared statements and parameter binding.
*   Input validation and filtering.
*   Minimize database user permissions.
*   Regular security audits.

**Payload Example:**

```
Parameter: doctorspecilization (POST)
    Type: time-based blind
    Title: MySQL >= 5.0.12 AND time-based blind (query SLEEP)
    Payload: doctorspecilization=111' AND (SELECT 4662 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))PFML) AND 'ziXa'='ziXa&submit=
```
