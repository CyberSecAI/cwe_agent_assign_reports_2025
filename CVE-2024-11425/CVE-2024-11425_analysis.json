CWE-131 is the root cause, directly causing an incorrect buffer allocation. CWE-787 is a more specific consequence of the incorrect buffer size, resulting in writing outside the intended memory region.

This leads to a Denial-of-Service.\n\nCWE-131 (Root Cause) -> CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) -> Denial-of-Service (Impact)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe primary weakness is CWE-131 **Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size**, which is supported by the vulnerability description key phrases and CVE reference links content summary. The vulnerability description clearly states that the root cause is an **Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size**. This aligns perfectly with CWE-131, which describes a scenario where the product doesn't correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, potentially leading to a buffer overflow.\n\nThe retriever results also list CWE-131 as the top candidate.\nCWE-787 **Out-of-bounds Write** is a secondary candidate as it is a direct consequence of the incorrect calculation, but CWE-131 is the root cause.\nCWE-119 **Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer** is a general class of error and less specific than CWE-787.\n\nThe evidence from the vulnerability description is strong and directly supports the selection of CWE-131 as the primary root cause. The selection of CWE-131 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **incorrect calculation** that leads to the vulnerability, while CWE-787 and CWE-119 are consequences of this error.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 4.33\n**Source**: graph\n\n**Description**:\nCWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.",
