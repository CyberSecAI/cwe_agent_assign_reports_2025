CWE-131, \"Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size,\" can precede CWE-119, which can lead to out-of-bounds access. These relationships help refine the classification and understand potential causes.

This can then lead to a **buffer over-read** (CWE-126), resulting in sensitive information disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary, which indicated a potential for out-of-bounds access and memory leaks. The retriever results highlighted CWE-125, CWE-126, and CWE-131 as potential candidates. The final selection was based on the evidence pointing towards an **out-of-bounds read** as the primary issue, with potential contributing factors like incorrect buffer size calculation and the resulting over-read.
