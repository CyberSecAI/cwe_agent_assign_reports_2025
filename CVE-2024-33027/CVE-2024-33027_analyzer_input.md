    ## WEAKNESS: 'arbitrary user-space app gains kernel level privilege'

Relevant CWEs for this WEAKNESS:

### 1. CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse (Score: 174.22)

The product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or "zeroize" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities....

### 2. CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition (Score: 168.92)

The product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check. This can cause the product to perform invalid actions when the resource is in an unexpected state....

### 3. CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write (Score: 164.84)

The product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer....

### 4. CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') (Score: 157.24)

The product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently....

### 5. CWE-667: Improper Locking (Score: 153.92)

The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors....

## WEAKNESS: 'Memory corruption'

Relevant CWEs for this WEAKNESS:

### 1. CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write (Score: 164.84)

The product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer....

### 2. CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') (Score: 157.24)

The product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently....

### 3. CWE-415: Double Free (Score: 156.51)

The product calls free() twice on the same memory address, potentially leading to modification of unexpected memory locations....

### 4. CWE-667: Improper Locking (Score: 153.92)

The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors....

### 5. CWE-908: Use of Uninitialized Resource (Score: 151.55)

The product uses or accesses a resource that has not been initialized....

## COMPONENT: 'GPU page table'

Relevant CWEs for this COMPONENT:

### 1. CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write (Score: 164.84)

The product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer....

### 2. CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') (Score: 157.24)

### 3. CWE-415: Double Free (Score: 156.51)

The product calls free() twice on the same memory address, potentially leading to modification of unexpected memory locations....

### 4. CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter (Score: 55.44)

The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields....

### 5. CWE-416: Use After Free (Score: 50.95)

The product reuses or references memory after it has been freed. At some point afterward, the memory may be allocated again and saved in another pointer, while the original pointer references a location somewhere within the new allocation. Any operations using the original pointer are no longer vali...
