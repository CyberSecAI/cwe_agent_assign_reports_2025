If we remove the module which will call ssi_protocol_remove() to make a cleanup, it will free ssi through kfree(ssi), while the work mentioned above will be used. The sequence of operations that may lead to a UAF bug is as follows CPU0 CPU1 | ssip_xmit_work ssi_protocol_remove | kfree(ssi) | | struct hsi_client *cl = ssi->cl | // use ssi Fix it by ensuring that the work is canceled before proceeding with the cleanup in ssi_protocol_remove().",
