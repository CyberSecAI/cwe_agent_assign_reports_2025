## Vulnerability Description
An unauthenticated attacker with access to the local network of the medical office can use known **default credentials** to gain remote DBA access to the Elefant Firebird database. The data in the database includes patient data and login credentials among other sensitive data. In addition, this enables an attacker to create and overwrite arbitrary files on the server filesystem with the rights of the Firebird database (NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM).

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **default credentials**
- **weakness:** **use known default credentials**
- **impact:** ['gain remote DBA access' and 'create and overwrite arbitrary files on the server filesystem']
- **attacker:** unauthenticated attacker
- **product:** Elefant Firebird database

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-50588:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The HASOMED Elefant medical software uses a Firebird database to store sensitive data. The Firebird server is exposed on all interfaces on port 3050, and it is accessible using default credentials ("SYSDBA:masterkey").

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Use of default credentials:** The Firebird database is accessible using hardcoded default credentials.
- **Unprotected database:** The database server listens on all interfaces on the network, making it accessible to anyone with access to the local network.
- **Lack of authentication:**  No authentication is required to connect to the Firebird database, as long as the default credentials are used.
- **Insecure storage of credentials**: The Elefant login credentials stored in the database are only obfuscated by a simple XOR operation with 0x1b and can be easily recovered.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker can access patient data and login credentials stored in the database, leading to a data breach.
- **Data Manipulation:** An attacker can read, modify, or delete sensitive data, including patient records and login information.
- **Privilege Escalation:** By exploiting the Firebird database access, an attacker can create and overwrite files on the server's filesystem with the privileges of the "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM" user. This can potentially lead to Remote Code Execution by writing a malicious webshell in a suitable directory, such as one used by MS IIS.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network Access:** An attacker needs access to the local network where the Elefant server is running to connect to the exposed Firebird port 3050.
- **Database access:** After gaining network access, the attacker connects to the database by using the default credentials.
- **File system access:** An attacker can use the database to write or overwrite arbitrary files on the server filesystem via Firebird delta files.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to reach the Elefant server on the local network, typically within the medical office's network.
- **Knowledge of default credentials:** The attacker must know or obtain the default Firebird database credentials ("SYSDBA:masterkey").

This information is more detailed than the typical CVE description and includes information about the method of exploitation and the impact to the system.
