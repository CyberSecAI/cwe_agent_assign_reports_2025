Any entity with the ability to authenticate via SSH to an affected AP as the config user is able to cause a privilege escalation via spawning a bash shell. The SSH CLI session does not require high permissions to exploit this vulnerability, but the config password is required to establish the session. The spawned shell is able to obtain root privileges.",
