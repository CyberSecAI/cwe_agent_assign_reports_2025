  "description": "This Advisory describes an issue that impacts Arista Wireless Access Points. Any entity with the ability to authenticate via SSH to an affected AP as the config user is able to cause a privilege escalation via spawning a bash shell. The SSH CLI session does not require high permissions to exploit this vulnerability, but the config password is required to establish the session. The spawned shell is able to obtain root privileges.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-4578\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection'). Specifically, an authenticated user with the \"config\" role can inject arbitrary commands into the system via the SSH CLI, leading to privilege escalation.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n*   **Command Injection (CWE-77):** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input when executing commands via the SSH CLI, allowing for command injection.\n*   **Privilege Escalation:** A user with the \"config\" role, which has limited privileges in the SSH CLI, can leverage the command injection to spawn a bash shell with root privileges.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n*   **Full System Compromise:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain root access on the affected Arista Wireless Access Point.\n*   **Data and Configuration Manipulation:** With root access, an attacker could potentially steal data, modify configurations, disrupt network operations, or install malicious software.\n*   **Loss of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:** The impact of a successful attack could lead to significant losses in all three of these areas.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n*   **Network-Adjacent Attack (AV:A):** An attacker must be on the same network segment as the target access point or have access to it.\n*   **SSH Access:** The attacker must gain access via SSH.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to reach the target access point on the network.\n*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs the password for the \"config\" user on the access point to initiate the SSH session and exploit the command injection vulnerability.\n*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** The attacker must be aware of this command injection vulnerability to be able to exploit it correctly.\n\n**Additional details from the document:**\n*   **Affected Devices:** All Arista WiFi Access Points\n*   **Unaffected Devices:** Arista EOS-based products, CloudVision products, Arista 7130 Systems running MOS, Arista Converged Cloud Fabric, Arista NDR, Arista Edge Threat Management, Arista Netvisor OS.\n*   **Indicators of Compromise (IOC):** Look for unusual command executions in the `/var/log/cli.log` file, specifically bash commands executed within CLI commands.\n*   **Mitigation:** Use a strong password for the config shell and share it only with trusted parties.\n*   **Resolution:** Upgrade to the specified fixed versions: 13.0.2-28-vv1101 or later (13.0.2.x train), 16.1.0-51-vv703 or later (16.1.0.x train).\n\nThis content provides more details than the basic CVE description, including the affected products, specific vulnerable software versions, and mitigation steps.",

I selected CWE-77 as it provides the most specific description of the **command injection** **weakness**, while the parent CWEs are more general. CWE-269 was considered due to the privilege escalation aspect, but it's a discouraged mapping without specific details on privilege management flaws.
