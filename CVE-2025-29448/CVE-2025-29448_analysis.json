CWE-770 is a child of CWE-400 and represents a more specific case of uncontrolled resource consumption.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe400 primary\n    class cwe770 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **logic flaw** in the booking logic, which leads to the ability to create appointments with excessively long durations. This ultimately results in uncontrolled resource consumption, causing a denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified a **logic flaw** that results in a denial of service by allowing unauthenticated attackers to create excessively long appointments. The core issue is the **uncontrolled resource consumption** (CWE-400) due to the **logic flaw**.\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"Booking **logic flaw** in Easy!Appointments v1.5.1 allows unauthenticated attackers to create appointments with excessively long durations, causing a denial of service by blocking all future booking availability.\"\n\nCWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) aligns well with the impact of the vulnerability, which is a denial of service due to the consumption of booking availability resources.\n\nCWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) is a more specific type of CWE-400, but it focuses on resource allocation. The vulnerability description specifies that attackers can create excessively long appointments, indicating that there are no limits on the duration.\n\nCWE-400 is at the Class level, and the mapping guidance suggests to look for more specific children. CWE-770 fits this description, making it a viable candidate.\n\nOther CWEs considered:\n\n*   CWE-1333 (Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity): This CWE is not relevant because the vulnerability is caused by a **logic flaw** in booking, not by inefficient regular expressions.\n*   CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer): This CWE is not relevant as there is no mention of memory buffer issues.\n*   CWE-307 (Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts): This CWE is not relevant because the attackers are unauthenticated, and the issue is with appointment booking, not authentication.\n*   CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key): While the attackers are unauthenticated, the core issue is not an authorization bypass, but rather a **logic flaw** in handling appointment durations.\n\nBased on the evidence, CWE-400 is the primary weakness, with CWE-770 as a more specific secondary weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web
