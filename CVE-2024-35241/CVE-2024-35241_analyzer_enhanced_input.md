## Vulnerability Description
Composer is a dependency manager for PHP. On the 2.x branch prior to versions 2.2.24 and 2.7.7, the `status`, `reinstall` and `remove` commands with packages installed from source via git containing specially crafted branch names in the repository can be used to execute code. Patches for this issue are available in version 2.2.24 for 2.2 LTS or 2.7.7 for mainline. As a workaround, avoid installing dependencies via git by using `--prefer-dist` or the `preferred-install dist` config setting.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** execute code
- **vector:** specially crafted branch names
- **product:** Composer
- **version:** 2.x prior to 2.2.24 and 2.7.7
- **component:** status, reinstall and remove commands

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-35241

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of git branch names within the `composer` dependency manager for PHP. Specifically, when running `status`, `reinstall`, or `remove` commands on packages installed via git, a specially crafted git branch name could lead to command injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Command Injection: The core weakness is the ability to inject arbitrary commands via a malicious git branch name. The application uses the branch name in a `git diff` command without proper sanitization or escaping.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Code Execution: Successful exploitation of the vulnerability would allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system where the vulnerable `composer` commands are run. This could lead to complete system compromise, data exfiltration, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious Git Branch Names: The primary attack vector is a crafted git branch name within a repository.
- Composer Commands: The vulnerability is triggered when the `composer` tool executes the `status`, `reinstall`, or `remove` command on packages installed from source via git.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to create or modify a git repository that has a malicious branch name.
- The attacker needs a victim to use the vulnerable version of `composer` and run commands which use the crafted branch name such as `status`, `reinstall` or `remove` on a project that uses the attacker's malicious repository.
- The attacker needs the victim to install a dependency via git, as the vulnerability is triggered by git operations.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerable code is located in `src/Composer/Downloader/GitDownloader.php`
- The fix involves using `ProcessExecutor::escape()` to properly escape the branch name before it is used in the `git diff` command.

**Affected versions:**
-  `composer` versions >=2.0, <2.2.24 and >=2.3, <2.7.7 are vulnerable.

**Patched versions:**
- `composer` versions 2.2.24 and 2.7.7 contain the fix.

**Workarounds:**
- The vulnerability can be avoided by using the `--prefer-dist` flag or the `preferred-install: dist` config setting, which avoids installing dependencies via git.
