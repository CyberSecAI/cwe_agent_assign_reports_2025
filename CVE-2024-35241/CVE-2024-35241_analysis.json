  "description": "Composer is a dependency manager for PHP. On the 2.x branch prior to versions 2.2.24 and 2.7.7, the `status`, `reinstall` and `remove` commands with packages installed from source via git containing specially crafted branch names in the repository can be used to execute code. Patches for this issue are available in version 2.2.24 for 2.2 LTS or 2.7.7 for mainline. As a workaround, avoid installing dependencies via git by using `--prefer-dist` or the `preferred-install dist` config setting.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-35241\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n- The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of git branch names within the `composer` dependency manager for PHP. Specifically, when running `status`, `reinstall`, or `remove` commands on packages installed via git, a specially crafted git branch name could lead to command injection.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- Command Injection: The core weakness is the ability to inject arbitrary commands via a malicious git branch name. The application uses the branch name in a `git diff` command without proper sanitization or escaping.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- Arbitrary Code Execution: Successful exploitation of the vulnerability would allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system where the vulnerable `composer` commands are run. This could lead to complete system compromise, data exfiltration, or other malicious activities.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- Malicious Git Branch Names: The primary attack vector is a crafted git branch name within a repository.\n- Composer Commands: The vulnerability is triggered when the `composer` tool executes the `status`, `reinstall`, or `remove` command on packages installed from source via git.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- The attacker must be able to create or modify a git repository that has a malicious branch name.\n- The attacker needs a victim to use the vulnerable version of `composer` and run commands which use the crafted branch name such as `status`, `reinstall` or `remove` on a project that uses the attacker's malicious repository.\n- The attacker needs the victim to install a dependency via git, as the vulnerability is triggered by git operations.\n\n**Additional details:**\n\n- The vulnerable code is located in `src/Composer/Downloader/GitDownloader.php`\n- The fix involves using `ProcessExecutor::escape()` to properly escape the branch name before it is used in the `git diff` command.\n\n**Affected versions:**\n-  `composer` versions >=2.0, <2.2.24 and >=2.3, <2.7.7 are vulnerable.\n\n**Patched versions:**\n- `composer` versions 2.2.24 and 2.7.7 contain the fix.\n\n**Workarounds:**\n- The vulnerability can be avoided by using the `--prefer-dist` flag or the `preferred-install: dist` config setting, which avoids installing dependencies via git.",

Because the command being constructed is an OS command, CWE-78 is the more specific and appropriate choice. CWE-88 was considered because the vulnerability involves improper handling of arguments, but CWE-78 better captures the overall vulnerability. The abstraction level of Base for CWE-78 is ideal for identifying the root cause.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command\"]\n    cwe88[\"CWE-88: Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')\"]\n    \n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n    cwe88 -->|CANALSOBE| cwe78\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe88 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the **improper handling of git branch names** by the Composer application when executing `status`, `reinstall`, or `remove` commands. This leads to **OS Command Injection**, where a specially crafted branch name allows for the execution of arbitrary commands on the system. The root cause is the **lack of proper sanitization or escaping** of the branch name before its use in a `git diff` command. The final impact is **arbitrary code execution**, which can lead to system compromise.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability is clearly an instance of **CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')**. The evidence from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary states, \"The core weakness is the ability to inject arbitrary commands via a malicious git branch name. The application uses the branch name in a `git diff` command without proper sanitization or escaping.\" This aligns directly with the description of CWE-78. The fix, which involves using `ProcessExecutor::escape()` to properly escape the branch name, also supports this classification.\n\nCWE-88 Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection') was considered because the vulnerability involves improper handling of arguments. However, the primary issue is that the crafted branch name is used in an OS command, making CWE-78 a more accurate representation of the vulnerability.
