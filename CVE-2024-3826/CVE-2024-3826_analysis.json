The vulnerability description indicates that validation is broken when using SAML SSO functionality, suggesting a problem with how cryptographic signatures are verified. |\n| CWE-1390 | Weak Authentication | 0.4 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary candidate. If cryptographic signatures are not properly verified, the authentication mechanism is weakened. However, without more context it is difficult to justify |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7\n*   **Evidence Strength:** LOW\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship considered was the parent-child relationship between CWE-345 (Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity) and CWE-347 (Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature), as CWE-347 is a specific type of data authenticity verification. The retriever results also indicated several authentication-related CWEs, such as CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication) and CWE-287 (Improper Authentication), but these are more general and less directly supported by the vulnerability description. The abstraction levels influenced the decision to choose CWE-347 (Base) over CWE-345 or CWE-1390 (Class) because it offered a more precise description of the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe347[\"CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature\"]\n    cwe345[\"CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n    \n    cwe347 -->|CHILDOF| cwe345\n    cwe347 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1390\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe347 primary\n    class cwe345,cwe1390 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper verification of cryptographic signatures** (CWE-347), which then leads to a **broken validation** of the SAML SSO functionality, possibly resulting in **authentication bypass** or other security breaches.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly suggests that the root cause of this vulnerability is the **improper verification of cryptographic signatures** within the SAML SSO functionality. The evidence is the vulnerability description stating that \"validation is broken when using the SAML Single Sign-On (SSO) functionality.\" This indicates that the system is not correctly verifying the signatures, leading to the broken validation.\n\nThe retriever results also supported this initial assessment, with CWE-347 (Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature) being ranked highly.\n\nThe decision to select CWE-347 is based on its specific focus on cryptographic signature verification, which aligns directly with the vulnerability description. Other CWEs, such as CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication) and CWE-287 (Improper Authentication), were considered but deemed less specific.\n\nThe selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because it accurately represents the weakness described in the vulnerability and is at the Base level of abstraction.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were
