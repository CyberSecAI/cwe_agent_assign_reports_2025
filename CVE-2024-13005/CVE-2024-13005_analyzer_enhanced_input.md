- **product:** 1000 Projects Attendance Tracking Management System
- **version:** 1

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-13005 (Based on the Github issue title and context)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a SQL injection found in the `/admin/attendance_action.php` file of the "Attendance Tracking Management System PHP & MySQL Project" version 1.0.
- The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization or validation of the `attendance_id` parameter which is directly used in SQL queries. This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the lack of input sanitization. This allows attackers to manipulate SQL queries by injecting malicious code. Specifically, boolean-based blind, stacked queries, and time-based blind SQL injection vulnerabilities are present.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Database Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database.
- **Sensitive Data Leakage:** Attackers can retrieve sensitive information from the database.
- **Data Tampering:** Attackers can modify or delete data within the database.
- **System Control:** Attackers may gain comprehensive control of the system via the database access.
- **Service Interruption:** Attackers can potentially disrupt services by manipulating database operations.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `attendance_id` parameter in the `/admin/attendance_action.php` file.
- This parameter is sent via a POST request.
- The attacker does not need to be logged in to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send POST requests to the `/admin/attendance_action.php` file.
- No authentication or authorization is required to exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL injection techniques and HTTP requests.
- Tools such as sqlmap can be used to exploit this vulnerability.

**Payload Examples:**
- **Boolean-based blind:** `attendance_id=2' AND 9004=(SELECT (CASE WHEN (9004=9004) THEN 9004 ELSE (SELECT 9029 UNION SELECT 2693) END))-- JLHy&action=delete`
- **Stacked Queries:** `attendance_id=2';SELECT SLEEP(5)#&action=delete`
- **Time-based blind:** `attendance_id=2' AND 4686=BENCHMARK(5000000,MD5(0x5a765571))-- ltEb&action=delete`

**Mitigation:**
- The provided content also recommends using prepared statements with parameter binding, input validation and filtering, minimizing database user permissions, and conducting regular security audits.
