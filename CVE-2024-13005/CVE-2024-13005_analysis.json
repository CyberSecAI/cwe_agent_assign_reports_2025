  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-13005 (Based on the Github issue title and context)\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n- The vulnerability is a SQL injection found in the `/admin/attendance_action.php` file of the \"Attendance Tracking Management System PHP & MySQL Project\" version 1.0.\n- The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization or validation of the `attendance_id` parameter which is directly used in SQL queries. This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the lack of input sanitization. This allows attackers to manipulate SQL queries by injecting malicious code. Specifically, boolean-based blind, stacked queries, and time-based blind SQL injection vulnerabilities are present.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Unauthorized Database Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database.\n- **Sensitive Data Leakage:** Attackers can retrieve sensitive information from the database.\n- **Data Tampering:** Attackers can modify or delete data within the database.\n- **System Control:** Attackers may gain comprehensive control of the system via the database access.\n- **Service Interruption:** Attackers can potentially disrupt services by manipulating database operations.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- The attack vector is through the `attendance_id` parameter in the `/admin/attendance_action.php` file.\n- This parameter is sent via a POST request.\n- The attacker does not need to be logged in to exploit this vulnerability.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- The attacker needs the ability to send POST requests to the `/admin/attendance_action.php` file.\n- No authentication or authorization is required to exploit this vulnerability.\n- The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL injection techniques and HTTP requests.\n- Tools such as sqlmap can be used to exploit this vulnerability.\n\n**Payload Examples:**\n- **Boolean-based blind:** `attendance_id=2' AND 9004=(SELECT (CASE WHEN (9004=9004) THEN 9004 ELSE (SELECT 9029 UNION SELECT 2693) END))-- JLHy&action=delete`\n- **Stacked Queries:** `attendance_id=2';SELECT SLEEP(5)#&action=delete`\n- **Time-based blind:** `attendance_id=2' AND 4686=BENCHMARK(5000000,MD5(0x5a765571))-- ltEb&action=delete`\n\n**Mitigation:**\n- The provided content also recommends using prepared statements with parameter binding, input validation and filtering, minimizing database user permissions, and conducting regular security audits.",
