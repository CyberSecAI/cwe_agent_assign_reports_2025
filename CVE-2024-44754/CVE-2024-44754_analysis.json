This is achieved by exploiting the externally accessible USB-C port.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **Firmware vulnerability:** Devices with firmware up to #15142 are susceptible to hostile takeover.\n*   **Physical access vulnerability:** An attacker with physical access to the device can exploit the vulnerability.\n*   **Lack of secure boot/firmware verification:** The attacker can use keys extracted from another device running vulnerable firmware to craft and install malicious firmware.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   **Full persistent control:** Successful exploitation grants the attacker full and persistent control over the device.\n*   **Notification manipulation:** The attacker can invalidate intended notifications regarding noise levels and occupancy.\n*   **Surveillance:** The attacker can install persistent surveillance code to spy on guests and/or the host.\n*   **Data exfiltration:** The attacker can exfiltrate data over the network.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   **Physical access:** The attacker requires physical access to the Minut M2 device.\n*   **USB-C port:** The attack is performed through the externally accessible USB-C port.\n*   **Firmware crafting:** The attacker needs to craft new firmware in advance using keys extracted from another vulnerable device.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   **Physical proximity:** The attacker must be physically proximate to the device.\n*   **Firmware extraction:** Ability to extract keys from another Minut M2 device running vulnerable firmware.\n*   **Firmware crafting:** Ability to craft malicious firmware.\n*   **Technical expertise:** Understanding of firmware and device exploitation.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   **Firmware update:** Owners should verify that their devices have received a recent firmware update to at least version #1056696.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n*   The content provides more detail than the placeholder CVE description.\n*   The vulnerability is particularly relevant to the short-term rental market, where attackers may have legitimate physical access.\n*   The vendor was notified on 2024-08-16, and devices in active use should have received updated firmware.\n*   The advisory is a public disclosure from Amlisoft AB.",

The vulnerability description highlights the **key extraction** and subsequent injection of modified firmware, suggesting a potential for **hard-coded cryptographic keys**. The chain starts with hard-coded keys (if present), leading to key extraction and finally to firmware injection.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe321[\"CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key\"]\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    \n    cwe321 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe321 primary\n    class cwe798 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the presence of cryptographic keys within the firmware. If these keys are **hard-coded** (CWE-798), they become susceptible to extraction (CWE-321). Once extracted, these keys can be used to craft and inject malicious firmware, leading to a full persistent control of the device and other impacts like notification manipulation and surveillance.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is primarily based on the vulnerability description, which emphasizes the **key extraction** aspect. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary provides additional details about the ability to craft and install malicious firmware using the extracted keys.\n\nCWE-321 (Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key) is selected as the primary CWE because it directly addresses the vulnerability related to **key extraction** and its potential use in firmware injection. While the description does not explicitly state that the keys are hard-coded, the fact that they can be extracted and used suggests that they are either hard-coded or insufficiently protected, making CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials) a secondary candidate.\n\nThe retriever results list several potentially relevant CWEs, including CWE-1300 (Improper Protection of Physical Side Channels), CWE-311 (Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data), and CWE-345 (Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity). However, these CWEs are less directly related to the **key extraction** aspect of the vulnerability.\n\nThe selection of CWE-321 is at the variant level, providing the most specific classification for this vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
