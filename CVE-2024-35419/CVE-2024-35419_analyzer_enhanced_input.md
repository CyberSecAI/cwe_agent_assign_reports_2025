## Vulnerability Description
wac commit 385e1 was discovered to contain a **heap overflow** via the load_module function at /wac-asan/wa.c. This vulnerability allows attackers to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) via a crafted wasm file.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **heap overflow**
- **impact:** Denial of Service (DoS)
- **vector:** crafted wasm file
- **attacker:** attackers
- **product:** wac
- **version:** commit 385e1
- **component:** load_module function at /wac-asan/wa.c

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-35419:

**Root Cause:**
- A heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability exists in the `load_module` function within the `wa.c` file of the wac project.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Heap-buffer-overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a heap buffer overflow, which occurs when the program writes beyond the allocated memory region.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  A successful exploit can lead to a denial-of-service condition, as the overflow can cause the program to crash or behave unpredictably.
- **Code Execution:** The advisory suggests the potential for code execution ("Impact Code execution: true"). While not explicitly demonstrated in the provided crash report, heap overflows can sometimes be leveraged for arbitrary code execution if carefully crafted.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted WASM file:** The vulnerability is triggered by providing a specially crafted WASM file as input to the vulnerable `wace` executable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide an arbitrary WASM file to the `wace` executable. This could be achieved remotely if the application processes externally provided WASM files.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided ASAN report shows the exact location of the crash, specifically a write operation of 4 bytes at address `0xf3c004d4`, which is outside the bounds of allocated memory.
- The vulnerability is present in commit `385e13c` of the `kanaka/wac` repository.
- The issue report on GitHub includes a link to a specific WASM file that triggers the vulnerability, confirming its existence and facilitating reproduction.
- Multiple heap buffer overflows may be present, as indicated by the issue title change.

In summary, CVE-2024-35419 is a heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability in the wac project triggered by crafted WASM files, potentially leading to denial of service and possibly code execution. The vulnerability resides in the `load_module` function.
