# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-50059

# Vulnerability Description

    In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ntb ntb_hw_switchtec Fix **use after free** vulnerability in switchtec_ntb_remove due to **race condition** In the switchtec_ntb_add function, it can call switchtec_ntb_init_sndev function, then &sndev->check_link_status_work is bound with check_link_status_work. switchtec_ntb_link_notification may be called to start the work. If we remove the module which will call switchtec_ntb_remove to make cleanup, it will free sndev through kfree(sndev), while the work mentioned above will be used. The sequence of operations that may lead to a UAF bug is as follows CPU0 CPU1 | check_link_status_work switchtec_ntb_remove | kfree(sndev) | | if (sndev->link_force_down) | // use sndev Fix it by ensuring that the work is canceled before proceeding with the cleanup in switchtec_ntb_remove.

    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis
    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. 
    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.

    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'race condition'

Relevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:

### 1. CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') (Score: 650.79)

The product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently....

### 2. CWE-415: Double Free (Score: 599.58)

The product calls free() twice on the same memory address, potentially leading to modification of unexpected memory locations....

### 3. CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition (Score: 591.76)

The product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check. This can cause the product to perform invalid actions when the resource is in an unexpected state....

### 4. CWE-667: Improper Locking (Score: 579.51)

The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors....

### 5. CWE-364: Signal Handler Race Condition (Score: 557.86)

The product uses a signal handler that introduces a race condition....

### 4. CWE-667: Improper Locking (Score: 579.51)

The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors....

### 5. CWE-401: Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime (Score: 549.45)

The product does not sufficiently track and release allocated memory after it has been used, which slowly consumes remaining memory....
