  "description": "reNgine is an automated reconnaissance framework for web applications. A vulnerability was discovered in reNgine, where **an insider attacker with any role** (such as Auditor, Penetration Tester, or Sys Admin) **can extract sensitive information from other reNgine users.** After running a scan and obtaining vulnerabilities from a target, the attacker can retrieve details such as `username`, `password`, `email`, `role`, `first name`, `last name`, `status`, and `activity information` by making a GET request to `/api/listVulnerability/`. This issue has been addressed in version 2.2.0 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",

CWE-285 is a potential secondary weakness, suggesting that the authorization mechanism might be insufficient to prevent access to this information. CWE-200 is at the Base level, which is the preferred level. CWE-285 is at the Class level and is discouraged.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe285 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a potential authorization issue (CWE-285) which leads to the exposure of sensitive information (CWE-200). An insider attacker with any role can extract sensitive information from other reNgine users, suggesting a lack of proper access controls.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis indicates that the primary weakness is CWE-200 because the main impact of the vulnerability is the exposure of sensitive user data. The evidence explicitly mentions that an attacker can retrieve details such as `username`, `password`, `email`, `role`, `first name`, `last name`, `status`, and `activity information`. The vulnerability description key phrases also highlight the **impact** as extracting sensitive information from other reNgine users. This aligns directly with the description of CWE-200, \"The product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have that information.\"\n\nCWE-285 was considered as a secondary weakness because the vulnerability description indicates that **an insider attacker with any role** can exploit this vulnerability. This suggests a possible **improper authorization** issue, however, the main impact is still the exposure of sensitive information.\n\nThe retriever results listed several CWEs related to input validation and injection, but these are not directly relevant since the vulnerability involves information exposure due to insufficient access controls rather than malicious input.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web server receives a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not used: Irrelevant to the vulnerability description.*\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not used: This CWE is not the best fit as the sensitive information is being exposed via an API endpoint and not through storage/transfer.*\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n*Not used: Irrelevant to the vulnerability description.*\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
