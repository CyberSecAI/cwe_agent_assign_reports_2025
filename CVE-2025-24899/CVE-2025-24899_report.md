# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2025-24899

## Description

reNgine is an automated reconnaissance framework for web applications. A vulnerability was discovered in reNgine, where **an insider attacker with any role** (such as Auditor, Penetration Tester, or Sys Admin) **can extract sensitive information from other reNgine users.** After running a scan and obtaining vulnerabilities from a target, the attacker can retrieve details such as `username`, `password`, `email`, `role`, `first name`, `last name`, `status`, and `activity information` by making a GET request to `/api/listVulnerability/`. This issue has been addressed in version 2.2.0 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Impact:** extract sensitive information from other reNgine users
- **Vector:** GET request to /api/listVulnerability/
- **Attacker:** insider attacker with any role

*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is CWE-200, which indicates the exposure of sensitive information. CWE-285 is a potential secondary weakness, suggesting that the authorization mechanism might be insufficient to prevent access to this information. CWE-200 is at the Base level, which is the preferred level. CWE-285 is at the Class level and is discouraged.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with a potential authorization issue (CWE-285) which leads to the exposure of sensitive information (CWE-200). An insider attacker with any role can extract sensitive information from other reNgine users, suggesting a lack of proper access controls.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis indicates that the primary weakness is CWE-200 because the main impact of the vulnerability is the exposure of sensitive user data. The evidence explicitly mentions that an attacker can retrieve details such as `username`, `password`, `email`, `role`, `first name`, `last name`, `status`, and `activity information`. The vulnerability description key phrases also highlight the **impact** as extracting sensitive information from other reNgine users. This aligns directly with the description of CWE-200, "The product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have that information."

CWE-285 was considered as a secondary weakness because the vulnerability description indicates that **an insider attacker with any role** can exploit this vulnerability. This suggests a possible **improper authorization** issue, however, the main impact is still the exposure of sensitive information.

The retriever results listed several CWEs related to input validation and injection, but these are not directly relevant since the vulnerability involves information exposure due to insufficient access controls rather than malicious input.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web server receives a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not used: Irrelevant to the vulnerability description.*

## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not used: This CWE is not the best fit as the sensitive information is being exposed via an API endpoint and not through storage/transfer.*

## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.

*Not used: Irrelevant to the vulnerability description.*

## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

*Not used: Irrelevant to the vulnerability description.*

## CWE-93: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses CRLF (carriage return line feeds) as a special element, e.g. to separate lines or records, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CRLF sequences from inputs.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not used: Irrelevant to the vulnerability description.*

## CWE-941: Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product creates a communication channel to initiate an outgoing request to an actor, but it does not correctly specify the intended destination for that actor.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not used: Irrelevant to the vulnerability description.*

## CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product generates an error message that includes sensitive information about its environment, users, or associated data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not used: The sensitive information is being exposed in an API response, not necessarily being inserted into a request.*

## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not used: While related, CWE-200 is a better fit because the exposed data is user data, not necessarily system-level information.*

## CWE-1286: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input that is expected to be well-formed - i.e., to comply with a certain syntax - but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input complies with the syntax.
