Affected is the function MDCImporterInternReadFile of the file assimp/code/AssetLib/MDC/MDCLoader.cpp of the component MDC File Parser. The manipulation of the argument pcVerts leads to out-of-bounds read. It is possible to launch the attack on the local host. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The project decided to collect all Fuzzer bugs in a main-issue to address them in the future. Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-89 CWE-121 CWE-125 CWE-79 CWE-787 CWE-190 CWE-122 CWE-126",
