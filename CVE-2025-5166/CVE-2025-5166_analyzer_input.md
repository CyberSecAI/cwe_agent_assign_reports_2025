# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-5166

## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability was found in Open Asset Import Library Assimp 5.4.3. It has been classified as problematic. Affected is the function MDCImporterInternReadFile of the file assimp/code/AssetLib/MDC/MDCLoader.cpp of the component MDC File Parser. The manipulation of the argument pcVerts leads to **out-of-bounds read**. It is possible to launch the attack on the local host. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The project decided to collect all Fuzzer bugs in a main-issue to address them in the future.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **out-of-bounds read**
- **product:** Open Asset Import Library Assimp
- **version:** 5.4.3
- **component:** MDCImporterInternReadFile of the file assimp/code/AssetLib/MDC/MDCLoader.cpp

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-5166 (PLACEHOLDER) based on provided content:

The provided content discusses issues found in the assimp library, specifically related to fuzzing and sanitization. It details two issues:

**1. Epic: Fuzzer/sanitizer bugs needing attention (#6128)**

This is an epic issue tracking multiple bugs discovered through fuzzing and sanitization. It serves as a central point for managing these issues and provides a workflow for addressing them.

**2. Bug: Heap OOB read in `MDCImporter::InternReadFile` (#6168)**

This issue is a specific bug identified by a fuzzer and sanitizer (ASan).  Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `InternReadFile` function in `MDCLoader.cpp` does not check if `pcVerts` is still within the bounds of the file being read.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Heap out-of-bounds read.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** The ASan output indicates a segmentation fault (SEGV) due to reading from an invalid memory address. This could potentially lead to a crash or, in some cases, arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by a specially crafted MDC file processed by the assimp library. The provided reproducer.zip contains such a file.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious MDC file to the application using the assimp library.
*   **Mitigation or fix:** The issue description suggests adding a bounds check to ensure `pcVerts` remains within the valid memory region of the file.

**Relationship to CVE-2025-5166:**

Without the actual CVE description, it's impossible to definitively say if these issues are related. However, the heap out-of-bounds read in `MDCImporter::InternReadFile` (#6168) is a plausible candidate for a CVE, given its potential security impact.

**More detail than official CVE description:**

The provided content offers significantly more detail than a typical CVE description. It includes:

*   Specific file and line numbers where the vulnerability exists.
*   ASan output providing detailed crash information.
*   A reproducer file to demonstrate the vulnerability.
*   Instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
*   Context about the fuzzing and sanitization process that discovered the bug.
