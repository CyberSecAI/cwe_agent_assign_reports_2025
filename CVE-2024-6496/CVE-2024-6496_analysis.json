CWE-862 is a Class-level CWE, while CWE-352 is a Compound CWE representing the full attack. CWE-352 is the best fit because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions CSRF.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe352 -- REQUIRES --> cwe862\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe352 primary\n    class cwe862 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing CSRF checks** (CWE-352 [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)]), which allows an attacker to trick a logged-in user into performing actions without their consent, such as deleting polls. The **missing authorization** (CWE-862 [Missing Authorization]) enables the CSRF attack.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that the Light Poll WordPress plugin **does not have CSRF checks** when deleting polls. This aligns directly with CWE-352 [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)], which describes a situation where a web application doesn't sufficiently verify if a request was intentionally provided by the user. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms that the root cause is the lack of CSRF checks.\n\nCWE-862 [Missing Authorization] was also considered, as a **lack of CSRF checks** can be seen as a form of **missing authorization**. However, CWE-352 is more specific and directly addresses the type of attack (CSRF), so it is the primary CWE.\n\nThe retriever results also list CWE-352 [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)] as the top hit.\n\nThe final decision is based on the clear evidence in the vulnerability description, the retriever results, and the definitions of the CWEs. CWE-352 [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)] is the most appropriate CWE at a Compound level of abstraction, while CWE-862 [Missing Authorization] is a secondary factor at Class level.\n\nRelevant CWE
