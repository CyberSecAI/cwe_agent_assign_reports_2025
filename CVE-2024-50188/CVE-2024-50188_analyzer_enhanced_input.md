## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved net phy dp83869 fix **memory corruption** when enabling fiber When configuring the fiber port, the DP83869 PHY driver **incorrectly calls linkmode_set_bit() with a bit mask (1 << 10) rather than a bit number (10)**. This corrupts some other memory location -- in case of arm64 the priv pointer in the same structure. Since the advertising flags are updated from supported at the end of the function the incorrect line isnt needed at all and can be removed.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **incorrectly calls linkmode_set_bit() with a bit mask (1 << 10) rather than a bit number (10)**
- **weakness:** **memory corruption**
- **product:** Linux kernel
- **component:** DP83869 PHY driver

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The DP83869 PHY driver incorrectly calls `linkmode_set_bit()` with a bitmask instead of a bit number when configuring the fiber port.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory corruption.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The incorrect bitmask corrupts other memory locations, potentially leading to system instability or other undefined behavior. On arm64, it was observed to corrupt the `priv` pointer in the same structure.
- **Attack vectors**: Configuring the fiber port of the DP83869 PHY.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:  The attacker needs to be able to trigger the fiber port configuration in the driver.
