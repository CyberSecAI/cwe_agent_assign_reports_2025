  "cve_id": "CVE-2024-7416",
  "description": "The Reveal Template plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Full Path Disclosure in all versions up to, and including, 3.7. This is due to the plugin allowing direct access to the bootstrap.php file which has display_errors on. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve the full path of the web application, which can be used to aid other attacks. The information displayed is not useful on its own, and requires another vulnerability to be present for damage to an affected website.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-7416:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\n*   The vulnerability exists because the `bootstrap.php` file in the Reveal Template plugin for WordPress is directly accessible.\n*   This file has `display_errors` set to \"on\", which causes the full path of the web application to be exposed in error messages when the file is accessed directly.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Full Path Disclosure:** The primary weakness is the exposure of the web application's full path due to the `display_errors` setting in the accessible `bootstrap.php` file.\n*   **Direct File Access:** The plugin allows direct access to a file (`bootstrap.php`) that should not be publicly accessible.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary impact is the disclosure of the full path of the web application, a sensitive piece of information.\n*   **Aid to Further Attacks:** Although the path disclosure is not immediately harmful on its own, it can be used by attackers to gather more information about the server's configuration, which can be used to aid other attacks.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Unauthenticated Remote Access:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability remotely without needing any authentication.\n*   **Direct File Request:** The attack vector involves directly requesting the `bootstrap.php` file through a web browser or other HTTP client.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Remote Access:** The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the WordPress site.\n*   **No Authentication:** The attacker does not require any valid credentials or authentication to exploit this vulnerability.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe vulnerability in the Reveal Template plugin allows unauthenticated remote attackers to obtain the full path of the WordPress installation by directly accessing the `bootstrap.php` file. This is due to the plugin leaving `display_errors` enabled in this file, which is not intended to be publicly accessible. While this full path disclosure vulnerability does not have a severe impact on its own, it can aid an attacker in planning and executing further attacks against the server.",

While CWE-209 is a Base level CWE, its parent CWEs were considered but were too abstract to accurately represent the vulnerability.

The graph relationships do not significantly alter this assessment, as the parent CWEs of CWE-209 are too abstract.\n\nCWE-425 (Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')) is included as a secondary CWE because the vulnerability involves direct access to the `bootstrap.php` file. However, the primary issue is the exposure of sensitive information in the error message, making CWE-209 the more accurate classification.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, as they directly address the root cause and the resulting information disclosure.
