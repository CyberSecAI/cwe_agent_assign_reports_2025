  "description": "Vulnerability in the Oracle Application Object Library product of Oracle E-Business Suite (component Core). Supported versions that are affected are 12.2.5-12.2.14. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise Oracle Application Object Library. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability to cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS) of Oracle Application Object Library.
