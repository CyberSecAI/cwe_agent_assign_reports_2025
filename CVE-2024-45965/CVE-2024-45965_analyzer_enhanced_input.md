## Vulnerability Description
Contao 5.4.1 allows an authenticated admin account to upload a SVG file containing malicious javascript code into the target system. If the file is accessed through the website, it could lead to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack or execute arbitrary code via a crafted javascript to the target.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **cross-site scripting**
- **impact:** execute arbitrary code
- **vector:** SVG file with malicious javascript code
- **attacker:** authenticated admin account
- **product:** Contao
- **version:** 5.4.1

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the Contao application's insufficient sanitization of uploaded SVG files, allowing for the inclusion of malicious JavaScript code within them.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Malicious File Upload:** The application allows the upload of SVG files without properly sanitizing their content.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Specifically, stored XSS because the malicious payload is stored on the server and executed when the SVG is accessed through the website.

*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By embedding malicious JavaScript within the SVG file, an attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of the victim's browser when the SVG is viewed.
    *  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The attacker can perform actions on behalf of the victim, such as stealing cookies, redirecting the user, or modifying the content of the page, due to the stored XSS.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **File Upload:** The attacker uploads a crafted SVG file containing malicious JavaScript through the file upload functionality within the Contao administration interface.
    *   **Accessing the SVG file:** The malicious SVG file is accessed by the user via the web browser, triggering the execution of the embedded javascript code.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Authenticated Admin Account:** The attacker needs to have valid administrator credentials to access the file upload functionality within the Contao backend.

In summary, this vulnerability allows an authenticated admin to upload a malicious SVG file, which when accessed by a user will execute embedded Javascript and allow for an XSS attack.
