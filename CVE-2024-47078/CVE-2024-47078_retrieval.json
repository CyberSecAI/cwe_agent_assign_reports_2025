  "vulnerability_info": "VulnerabilityInfo(cve_id='CVE-2024-47078', description='Meshtastic is an open source, off-grid, decentralized, mesh network. Meshtastic uses MQTT to communicate over an internet connection to a shared or private MQTT Server. Nodes can communicate directly via an internet connection or proxied through a connected phone (i.e., via bluetooth). Prior to version 2.5.1, multiple weaknesses in the MQTT implementation allow for authentication and **authorization bypass**es resulting in unauthorized control of MQTT-connected nodes. Version 2.5.1 contains a patch.', key_phrases={'rootcause': '', 'weakness': ['authentication bypass', 'authorization bypass'], 'impact': 'unauthorized control of MQTT-connected nodes', 'vector': '', 'attacker': '', 'product': 'Meshtastic', 'version': 'prior to version 2.5.1', 'component': 'MQTT implementation'}, reference_content=\"Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\\n\\n**Root Cause:** Multiple weaknesses in the Meshtastic MQTT implementation.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Authentication and authorization bypasses. The specific nature of these weaknesses is not described in the provided text.\\n\\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\\n*   Unauthorized control of MQTT-connected nodes. This implies attackers can potentially manipulate, disrupt, or gain access to data on the affected devices.\\n*   High impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.\\n\\n**Attack Vectors:** Network-based attacks via MQTT. This means an attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely over a network.\\n\\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker does not require any specific privileges or user interaction to exploit the vulnerability. The attack has a high complexity.\\n\\n**Additional Details:**\\n\\n*   **Affected Versions:** Meshtastic firmware versions prior to 2.5.1 are vulnerable.\\n*   **Patched Versions:** Version 2.5.1 and later include the necessary fixes.\\n*   **CVSS Score:** 8.1 (High).

Meshtastic uses MQTT to communicate over an internet connection to a shared or private MQTT Server. Nodes can communicate directly via an internet connection or proxied through a connected phone (i.e., via bluetooth). Prior to version 2.5.1, multiple weaknesses in the MQTT implementation allow for authentication and **authorization bypass**es resulting in unauthorized control of MQTT-connected nodes.
