  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-12898\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n- The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the `/admin/faculty_action.php` file of the \"Attendance Tracking Management System PHP & MySQL Project\" version 1.0.\n- The vulnerability occurs because the `faculty_course_id` parameter, sent via a multipart form, is directly used in SQL queries without proper sanitization or validation.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, where an attacker can insert malicious SQL code into the `faculty_course_id` parameter.\n- **Lack of Input Validation:** The system fails to validate and sanitize user-supplied input before using it in database queries, allowing malicious SQL injection.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Unauthorized Database Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database.\n- **Sensitive Data Leakage:** Attackers can extract sensitive data from the database.\n- **Data Tampering:** Attackers can modify or delete data.\n- **Comprehensive System Control:** In severe cases, attackers could gain complete control over the system.\n- **Service Interruption:** Attackers could potentially disrupt the service by manipulating the database.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is through an HTTP POST request to the `/admin/faculty_action.php` file.\n- **`faculty_course_id` Parameter:** The attacker injects malicious SQL code into the `faculty_course_id` parameter within the multipart form data.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **No Login Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring prior login or authorization.\n- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable web application.\n- **Ability to Craft HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to craft HTTP POST requests with the malicious SQL payload in the `faculty_course_id` parameter.\n\n**Technical Details:**\n\n- The provided payload is a time-based blind SQL injection payload:\n```\n------WebKitFormBoundarygzJtJBPlFuASFjAl\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"faculty_name\"\n\nBhupender Rana\n------WebKitFormBoundarygzJtJBPlFuASFjAl\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"faculty_address\"\n\nRohini, Delhi\n------WebKitFormBoundarygzJtJBPlFuASFjAl\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"faculty_emailid\"\n\nbhupender.rana@gmail.com\n------WebKitFormBoundarygzJtJBPlFuASFjAl\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"faculty_password\"\n\n------WebKitFormBoundarygzJtJBPlFuASFjAl\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"faculty_qualification\"\n\nB.Sc, B.Ed\n------WebKitFormBoundarygzJtJBPlFuASFjAl\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"faculty_course_id\"\n\n1\" AND (SELECT 2945 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))aoZQ)-- LLPZ\n------WebKitFormBoundarygzJtJBPlFuASFjAl\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"faculty_doj\"\n\n2020-09-01\n------WebKitFormBoundarygzJtJBPlFuASFjAl\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"faculty_id\"\n\n1\n------WebKitFormBoundarygzJtJBPlFuASFjAl\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"action\"\n\nEdit\n------WebKitFormBoundarygzJtJBPlFuASFjAl--\n```\n- The SQL injection payload `1\" AND (SELECT 2945 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))aoZQ)-- LLPZ` attempts to cause a 5-second delay if the injection is successful (time-based blind).\n- The `sqlmap` tool was used to verify and identify the vulnerability, as shown in the screenshots.\n\n**Suggested Repairs:**\n- **Prepared Statements:** Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection. This method separates the SQL code from the user-provided data.\n- **Input Validation and Filtering:** Implement strict validation and filtering of user-supplied input data to ensure they conform to the expected format.\n- **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Ensure the database user account used by the application has minimal permissions, avoiding high-privilege accounts like 'root' or 'admin'.\n- **Regular Security Audits:** Regularly audit the code and system for potential security vulnerabilities.\n\nThis information provides a comprehensive analysis of the identified SQL injection vulnerability based on the provided content.",
