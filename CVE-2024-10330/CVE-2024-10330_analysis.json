  "description": "In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.5.6, the `/v1/evaluators/` endpoint **lacks proper access control**, allowing any user associated with a project to fetch all evaluator data regardless of their role. This vulnerability permits low-privilege users to access potentially sensitive evaluation data.",

  "reference_content": "The content relates to a security fix for the lunary project. Here's a breakdown of the information extracted:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe commit message \"fix: security patches\" indicates that the changes address security vulnerabilities. However, the specific root cause isn't detailed in this snippet.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\nThe code changes suggest potential vulnerabilities related to:\n*   **Authorization:** The addition of `checkAccess` in several routes (evaluators, models, users) indicates a need to enforce access control.\n*   **Data Exposure:** The conditional inclusion of the `private_api_key` based on `hasAccess` suggests a potential for unauthorized access to sensitive information.\n*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** The check `(value === \"billing\" && currentUser.role !== \"owner\")` in the `RoleSelect` component and the conditional logic around displaying the private API key suggest issues with RBAC.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\nExploitation could lead to:\n*   Unauthorized access to evaluators, models, or user data.\n*   Exposure of private API keys.\n*   Unauthorized modification of user roles or organization settings.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n*   Direct API calls to vulnerable endpoints without proper authorization.\n*   Exploitation of RBAC flaws to gain elevated privileges.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n*   An attacker would need to be able to make API requests to the lunary backend.\n*   Depending on the specific vulnerability, an attacker might need to be an authenticated user with limited privileges to exploit RBAC flaws.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n*   Implementation of `checkAccess` to enforce authorization checks on API routes.\n*   Conditional display of sensitive data (private API keys) based on user access rights.\n*   RBAC checks to prevent unauthorized role assignments (e.g., preventing non-owners from assigning the \"billing\" role).\n*   The code changes aim to restrict access to sensitive data and functionality based on user roles and permissions.\n\n**More detail than official CVE description:**\nYes, this content provides significantly more detail than a placeholder CVE description. It shows the specific code changes made to address the security issues, including the addition of authorization checks and RBAC enforcement. It also gives insight into the potential impact and attack vectors.",

The analysis considered its relationships with child CWEs but determined that the available information was not specific enough to warrant selecting a more granular Base or Variant. The analysis also considered CWE-359, Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor, as a potential secondary weakness, recognizing its relationship to unauthorized access.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe359[\"CWE-359: Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe359 -->|RELATED| cwe862\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe359 secondary\n    class cwe284 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of proper access control** (CWE-862), leading to low-privilege users being able to fetch all evaluator data, potentially including sensitive information (CWE-359).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **root cause**, identified as the **lack of proper access control** on the `/v1/evaluators/` endpoint. This directly corresponds to CWE-862, Missing Authorization, as there is no check to ensure that the user has the necessary privileges to access the data. The vulnerability description and key phrases emphasize this **missing access control**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms the need to enforce access control with the addition of `checkAccess` in the code.\n\nCWE-359, Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor, was considered as a secondary CWE because the fetched evaluator data may contain sensitive information, and the **lack of authorization** allows unauthorized access to this information.\n\nThe retriever results and guidance further support the selection of CWE-862. The guidance specifically mentions that if no role/privilege check exists after login, then CWE-862 is a likely candidate.\n\nThe final decision is based on the evidence provided, the CWE specifications, and the mapping guidance. CWE-862 is selected as the primary CWE because it accurately represents the **root cause** of the vulnerability, which is the **lack of authorization** checks on the endpoint. It is at the Class level, which is the most appropriate level of specificity given the available information. CWE-359 is selected as a secondary CWE due to the potential exposure of sensitive information.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
