  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved powerpc/pseries/iommu **IOMMU incorrectly marks MMIO range in DDW** Power Hypervisor can possibily allocate MMIO window intersecting with Dynamic DMA Window (DDW) range, which is over 32-bit addressing. These MMIO pages needs to be marked as reserved so that IOMMU doesnt map DMA buffers in this range. The current code is not marking these pages correctly which is resulting in LPAR to OOPS while booting. The stack is at below BUG Unable to handle kernel data access on read at 0xc00800005cd40000 Faulting instruction address 0xc00000000005cdac Oops Kernel access of bad area, sig 11",

CWE-1260 was considered as a more general case of overlapping memory regions, and CWE-787 as a potential impact if the overlap leads to out-of-bounds writes. The abstraction levels were considered, with a preference for the base level which both CWE-1316 and CWE-1260 provide.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1316[\"CWE-1316: Fabric-Address Map Allows Programming of Unwarranted Overlaps of Protected and Unprotected Ranges\"]\n    cwe1260[\"CWE-1260: Improper Handling of Overlap Between Protected Memory Ranges\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    \n    cwe1316 -- Considered as a more specific case of --> cwe1260\n    cwe1316 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe787\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1316 primary\n    class cwe1260,cwe787 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **incorrect marking of the MMIO range** by the IOMMU, leading to a possible overlap with the Dynamic DMA Window (DDW). This overlap can potentially result in memory corruption, manifested as a kernel panic (\"LPAR to OOPS\"). The root cause is the misconfiguration of the address map, leading to memory region overlaps.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, particularly the vulnerability description stating that the **IOMMU incorrectly marks MMIO range in DDW**. This directly points to a memory mapping issue. The retriever results suggested CWE-1316, which aligns well with the description. The relationship analysis highlighted that CWE-1316 is a specific case of the more general CWE-1260. Given the specific mention of an address map in the description, CWE-1316 was selected as the primary CWE. CWE-787 was considered as a potential consequence. The selected CWEs are at the base level of specificity, which is appropriate for this vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1285: Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input that is expected to specify an index, position, or offset into an indexable resource such as a buffer or file, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the specified index/position/offset has the required properties.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-909: Missing Initialization of Resource\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not initialize a critical resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary.
