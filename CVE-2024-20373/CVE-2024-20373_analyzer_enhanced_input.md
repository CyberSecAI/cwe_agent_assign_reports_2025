## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability in the implementation of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) IPv4 access control list (ACL) feature of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to perform SNMP polling of an affected device, even if it is configured to deny SNMP traffic.&nbsp This vulnerability exists because **Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software do not support extended IPv4 ACLs for SNMP**, but they do allow administrators to configure extended named IPv4 ACLs that are attached to the SNMP server configuration without a warning message. This can result in no ACL being applied to the SNMP listening process. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by performing SNMP polling of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform SNMP operations that should be denied. The attacker has no control of the SNMP ACL configuration and would still need a valid SNMP version 2c (SNMPv2c) community string or SNMP version 3 (SNMPv3) user credentials. SNMP with IPv6 ACL configurations is not affected. For more information, see the section of this advisory.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software do not support extended IPv4 ACLs for SNMP**
- **impact:** perform SNMP polling of an affected device
- **attacker:** unauthenticated remote attacker
- **product:** Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software
- **component:** Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) IPv4 access control list (ACL) feature

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-20373:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

   The provided content directly relates to **CVE-2024-20373**. The advisory title "Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software SNMP Extended Named Access Control List Bypass Vulnerability", along with the included CVE ID, confirms its relevance.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

   - The vulnerability stems from the fact that Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software do not properly enforce IPv4 Access Control Lists (ACLs) for SNMP.
   - Specifically, while they accept configurations that attach extended *named* IPv4 ACLs to the SNMP server settings, these extended ACLs are *not actually applied* to the SNMP listening process. This allows traffic that should be blocked by the ACL to bypass the configured restrictions. The system only supports standard ACLs and not extended ACLs, even if there's no warning message when configuring it.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

   - **Incorrect ACL Handling:** The primary weakness is the software's failure to process extended named IPv4 ACLs, even though the software allows the user to configure and associate them with the SNMP process.
   - **Lack of Warning/Enforcement:** There's also a weakness in that the system doesn't notify administrators that extended ACLs are not supported, which can mislead them to think they are properly securing the device.
   - **Configuration Persistence Issues**: When upgrading or downgrading software versions, if an extended named ACL is configured, it's silently removed from the configuration upon rebooting.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

   - An unauthenticated, remote attacker can bypass the configured ACL restrictions.
   - This allows them to perform SNMP polling of the device, even if SNMP traffic should be denied according to the extended ACL.
   - A successful exploit allows the attacker to perform unauthorized SNMP operations.
   - **Note:** Attackers still require valid SNMPv2c community strings or SNMPv3 credentials. The vulnerability only bypasses the ACL access control list.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

   - The attack vector is remote and network-based.
   - An attacker would send SNMP polling requests to the device.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

   - The attacker must be able to reach the targeted device over the network.
   - The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the ACL bypass.
   -  The attacker must have a valid SNMP community string (for v2c) or SNMPv3 user credentials to execute SNMP operations.

**Additional details from the content that enhances the CVE Description:**

*   **Specific ACL Types:** The document clearly differentiates between standard (numbered or named) and extended (numbered or named) IPv4 ACLs, clarifying the vulnerability’s limitations to extended ACLs.
*   **Scenarios of Vulnerability:** It outlines two specific scenarios of how the vulnerability occurs, during configuration with affected versions, and while upgrading from or downgrading to an affected version.
*   **Workaround Details:** The document specifies that the workaround involves converting extended named ACLs to standard named ACLs, as well as applying this workaround before upgrades to avoid issues after upgrading to a fixed release that prevents the use of extended named ACLs.
*   **Affected Products:** Only Cisco IOS and IOS XE software is affected.
*   **Configuration Verification**: Includes the precise steps to verify if a device is vulnerable, using specific `show` commands to identify the presence of extended named ACLs.
*   **No Public Exploitation**:  Notes that at the time of publication, there were no known public exploits.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control

**Authentication**:
Determines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.

* Example phrases: "user must log in", "lack of login check", "bypasses login"
* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.

  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* – used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).

**Authorization**:
Determines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do. It decides access *after* identity is verified.

* Example phrases: "unauthorized access", "regular user can access admin panel", "role checks are missing"
* CWE relevance: use CWEs like 862, 863, 285 for authorization errors:

  * **CWE-862**: *Missing Authorization* – the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all.
  * **CWE-863**: *Incorrect Authorization* – the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).
  * **CWE-285**: *Improper Authorization* – general category for any flawed authorization logic or design.

**Access Control**:
A broader term that includes both authentication and authorization. Governs how resources are protected and who can access them under what conditions.

* CWE relevance:

  * **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* – top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear.
  * This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.

## Mapping Discussion – Common Misclassification Patterns

### 1. **CWE-306 vs CWE-862**:

* **306** is about lack of **authentication** (e.g., *no login required at all*).
* **862** is about lack of **authorization** *after* authentication (e.g., *admin check missing*).
* ✅ Example CWE-306: *“An unauthenticated attacker can invoke the password reset API.”*
* ✅ Example CWE-862: *“An authenticated user without admin privileges can delete any user account.”*

### 2. **CWE-285 vs CWE-284**:

* **285** is specific to authorization flaws – it's a better choice than 284 **if** the issue involves *improper or missing role checks*.
* **284** should be reserved for general access control issues when it’s unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.

---

## Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification

**Phrase like "unauthorized access" is not enough.**

* If you **cannot determine whether identity was checked**, assume it’s **authorization** and consider 862 or 863.
* If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** → CWE-306.
* If the **access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced**, but it's not due to missing checks, consider **CWE-284**.

---

## Good Mapping Examples

* ✅ **CWE-306**: “The endpoint `/admin/deleteUser` does not require any authentication.”
* ✅ **CWE-862**: “Any logged-in user can change any other user's email without being an admin.”
* ✅ **CWE-863**: “An admin check exists but incorrectly grants access to non-admin users.”
* ✅ **CWE-285**: “Application uses a static role check that fails when roles change dynamically.”
* ✅ **CWE-284**: “Inconsistent enforcement of access rules across services with unclear policy source.”
