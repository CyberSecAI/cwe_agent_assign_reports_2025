  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2024-11665:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\n*   The web administration interface of the affected EV charging station controllers is built using PHP scripts. These scripts are not protected against unauthorized access and directly use user-controlled input in system commands without proper sanitization. This allows for command injection.\n*  The lighttpd webserver is configured to enforce authentication, but these settings do not apply to the vulnerable PHP scripts.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Unauthenticated Command Injection:** Multiple PHP scripts within the web interface allow execution of arbitrary OS commands due to lack of input sanitization.\n*   **Lack of Access Control:** Vulnerable PHP scripts are accessible without any authentication, despite the web server being configured for authentication.\n*   **Incomplete Fix:** The vendor attempted to fix a previously reported command injection vulnerability but failed, leaving the vulnerability present in the latest firmware version at the time of analysis (2.0.4).\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   An attacker on the same local network as the EV charging station can execute arbitrary commands with elevated (root) privileges on the affected device. This can lead to full compromise of the charging station controller, potentially disrupting charging services, causing damage to the device or other connected systems, or enabling further attacks on the local network.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Network-based:** An attacker needs to be on the same local network (LAN) as the vulnerable device.\n*   **HTTP Requests:** The attacker exploits the vulnerabilities through HTTP requests to the web interface.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   Attacker must be on the same LAN as the charging station controller.\n*   No authentication is required.\n*   Attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerable endpoints/parameters.",
