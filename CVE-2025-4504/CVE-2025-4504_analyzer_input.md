## Analysis of CVE-2025-4504 Content

This content **RELATES** to a vulnerability, but it's not directly tied to a CVE with ID CVE-2025-4504 as the CVE description is a placeholder. It details a SQL injection vulnerability in "SourceCodester Online College Library System Project V1.0".  It provides more detail than a typical CVE description.

Here's an extraction of the relevant information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   A SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `/index.php` file due to insufficient user input validation of the `category` parameter. Malicious code injected through this parameter is directly used in SQL queries without proper cleaning or validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   SQL Injection

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Unauthorized database access
*   Sensitive data leakage
*   Data tampering
*   Comprehensive system control
*   Service interruption

**Attack vectors:**

*   The `category` parameter in a GET request to `/index.php` is vulnerable.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   No login or authorization is required to exploit the vulnerability.
*   Attacker needs to be able to craft and send malicious HTTP GET requests.

**Mitigation or fix:**

1.  **Use prepared statements and parameter binding:** This separates SQL code from user input.
2.  **Input validation and filtering:**  Strictly validate and filter user input.
3.  **Minimize database user permissions:** Use accounts with the minimum necessary permissions.
4.  **Regular security audits:** Conduct regular code and system security audits.

**Payload Example:**

```
Parameter: category (GET)
Type: boolean-based blind
Title: OR boolean-based blind - WHERE or HAVING clause (NOT)
Payload: category=1 OR NOT 2300=2300
```
