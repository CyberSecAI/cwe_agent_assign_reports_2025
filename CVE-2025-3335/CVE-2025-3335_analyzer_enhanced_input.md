## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-3335 Content

This content **RELATES** to a vulnerability, but it's a report *about* a vulnerability, not the CVE description itself. It provides more detail than a typical CVE description would.

Here's the extracted information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to insufficient user input validation of the 'id' parameter in the `/admin/category_update.php` file. Malicious SQL queries can be injected directly into SQL queries without proper cleaning or validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   SQL injection

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Unauthorized database access
*   Sensitive data leakage
*   Data tampering
*   Comprehensive system control
*   Service interruption

**Attack vectors:**

*   The `/admin/category_update.php` file is vulnerable via the 'id' parameter.
*   No login or authorization is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to send a crafted POST request to `/admin/category_update.php` with a malicious 'id' parameter. No authentication is required.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   Use prepared statements and parameter binding.
*   Input validation and filtering.
*   Minimize database user permissions.
*   Regular security audits.

**Payload Examples (from the report):**

*   `id=12' RLIKE (SELECT (CASE WHEN (7427=7427) THEN 12 ELSE 0x28 END))-- weHj&category=1586&update=`
*   `id=12' AND GTID_SUBSET(CONCAT(0x71766b7a71,(SELECT (ELT(3957=3957,1))),0x71787a6a71),3957)-- ICmu&category=1586&update=`
*   `id=12' AND (SELECT 2751 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))PvQb)-- UGZx&category=1586&update=`
