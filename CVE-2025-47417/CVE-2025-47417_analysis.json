The **root cause** is the active debug code being enabled in a production environment. |\n| CWE-200 | Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor | 0.7 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary CWE. This is the impact of the vulnerability. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.75\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship influencing the decision is that CWE-489, Active Debug Code, is a potential root cause that can lead to CWE-200, Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor. CWE-489 is at the Base level, which is preferable, while CWE-200 is at the Class level, making CWE-489 a more specific and appropriate root cause.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe489[\"CWE-489: Active Debug Code\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe200 -->|CANBE caused by| cwe489\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe489 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **active debug code** (CWE-489) being enabled, leading to snapshots of video being stored locally, and ultimately causing **exposure of sensitive information** (CWE-200) to unauthorized actors.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **exposure of sensitive information**, but the root cause is the **active debug code** functionality that enables the snapshots to be created in the first place. The vulnerability description states: \"When Enable Debug Images in Crestron Automate VX is active, snapshots of the captured video or portions thereof are stored locally on the system...\". This points directly to CWE-489, Active Debug Code, as the primary weakness. The impact of this **active debug code** is the **exposure of sensitive information**, which is represented by CWE-200. The choice of CWE-489 is further supported by its Base level of abstraction, making it a more specific classification than CWE-200, which is a Class.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-200 is commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error.
