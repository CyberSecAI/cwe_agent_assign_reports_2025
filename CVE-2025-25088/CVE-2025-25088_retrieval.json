The root cause isn\\'t explicitly stated, but CSRF vulnerabilities arise when a web application trusts user-supplied input without properly validating it, allowing an attacker to trick a user into executing unwanted actions.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\\n\\n*   Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\\n\\n**Impact of exploitation:**\\n\\nA malicious actor could force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact varies case by case.\\n\\n**Attack vectors:**\\n\\nThe attack vector is through exploiting the lack of CSRF protection in the WP Keyword Monitor plugin. An attacker would need to craft a malicious request that a logged-in user would unknowingly execute.\\n\\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\\n\\n*   Unauthenticated - The attacker does not need to be authenticated.\\n*   Ability to craft a malicious request.\\n\\n**Mitigation or fix:**\\n\\n*   No official fix is currently available (as of February 3, 2025).\\n*   Patchstack offers \"vPatching\" as a mitigation, which auto-mitigates the vulnerability even without an official patch.\\n\\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\\n\\n*   **Affected Software:** WP Keyword Monitor plugin\\n*   **Vulnerable Versions:** <= 1.0.5\\n*   **CVSS Score:** 7.1 (Low severity)\\n*   **OWASP Top 10 Category:** A3: Injection (Note: While CSRF isn\\'t directly an injection flaw, it can sometimes be used in conjunction with injection attacks.)\\n*   **Reported by:** 0xd4rk5id3\\n*   **Published by:** Patchstack\\n*   **PSID:** d18208bcccab', similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {}, 'top_cwes_by_threshold': {}}}, similarity_summary=SimilarityInsight(consensus_cwe='', top_cwes=[], confidence_levels={}, total_samples=0), analysis='', analysis_with_relationships='', criticism='', resolution='', relevant_cwes=[{'metadata': {'doc_id': '352', 'name': 'Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'weakness:cross-site scripting', 'keyphrase': 'cross-site scripting', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'weakness:XSS', 'keyphrase': 'XSS', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'product:blackus3r WP Keyword Monitor', 'keyphrase': 'blackus3r WP Keyword Monitor', 'type': 'product'}, {'id': 'version:n/a through 1.0.5', 'keyphrase': 'n/a through 1.0.5', 'type': 'version'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(284.2530524195196)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '79', 'name': \"Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\", 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'weakness:cross-site scripting', 'keyphrase': 'cross-site scripting', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'weakness:XSS', 'keyphrase': 'XSS', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'product:blackus3r WP Keyword Monitor', 'keyphrase': 'blackus3r WP Keyword Monitor', 'type': 'product'}, {'id': 'version:n/a through 1.0.5', 'keyphrase': 'n/a through 1.0.5', 'type': 'version'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(232.9548319486717)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '434', 'name': 'Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'weakness:cross-site scripting', 'keyphrase': 'cross-site scripting', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'weakness:XSS', 'keyphrase': 'XSS', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'product:blackus3r WP Keyword Monitor', 'keyphrase': 'blackus3r WP Keyword Monitor', 'type': 'product'}, {'id': 'version:n/a through 1.0.5', 'keyphrase': 'n/a through 1.0.5', 'type': 'version'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(206.06006512729948)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '89', 'name': \"Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\", 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.
