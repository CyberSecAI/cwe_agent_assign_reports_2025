The vulnerability results in information disclosure. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.6\n*   **Evidence Strength:** LOW\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nCWE-200 is a class-level CWE. There are many potential child CWEs that could be more specific, but without more details about the root cause, it is difficult to select a more specific CWE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    \n    class cwe200 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability description indicates an information disclosure vulnerability. Since there is no root cause information available, the chain is simply: Information Disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability is described as an \"Information Disclosure Vulnerability\".\n\nThe top CWE from the retriever results is CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor), which is a Class-level CWE. The description matches the vulnerability. However, the evidence is very limited, leading to a low confidence score.\n\nI am selecting CWE-200 based on the \"Information Disclosure Vulnerability\" key phrase. There is no root cause information to drive the selection of a more specific CWE.\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
