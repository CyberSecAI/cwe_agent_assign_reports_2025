CWE-285 is a Class-level CWE, and the retriever results did not point to a more specific Base or Variant level CWE. CWE-497, Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere, is related because it describes a potential impact of authorization failures, but it is not a direct child of CWE-285.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe497[\"CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\"]\n    \n    cwe497 -- \"RELATED TO\" --> cwe285\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe285 primary\n    class cwe497 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **logic issue** leading to **improper authorization**, which then leads to the **exposure of sensitive user data**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description indicates a **logic issue** that allows an app to access sensitive user data. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms the **root cause** as a **logic issue** and the weakness as an app being able to access sensitive user data.\n\nThe primary CWE selected is CWE-285 Improper Authorization because the **logic issue** likely resulted in **incorrect or missing authorization checks**. While CWE-285 is discouraged because it is a Class, the retriever results did not suggest any more specific CWEs that fit better.\n\nCWE-497 Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere is considered as a possible secondary weakness, describing the impact of the authorization failure i.e. sensitive data exposure.\n\nThe evidence for the root cause is relatively weak (\"logic issue\"), so the confidence score reflects that uncertainty.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not verify, or incorrectly verifies, the cryptographic signature for data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not selected*: This CWE is not related to **logic issues** or access of sensitive user data. It's specific to cryptographic signatures.\n\n## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not selected*: This CWE is not specific to the **logic issue** mentioned.
