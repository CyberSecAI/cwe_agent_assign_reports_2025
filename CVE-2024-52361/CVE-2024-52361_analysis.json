While CWE-522 is a broader class, CWE-256 directly addresses the specific issue of storing passwords in plaintext, which aligns perfectly with the vulnerability description. The relationships of CWE-256 to other CWEs, such as its parent CWE-522, helped to confirm its relevance.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe256[\"CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    \n    cwe256 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe256 primary\n    class cwe522 secondary\n    class cwe312 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is simple: the application **stores user credentials in plain text**, leading to potential unauthorized access by an authenticated user with access to the pod. The root cause is the **plaintext storage**, and the impact is potential compromise of user credentials.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the most specific CWE that accurately reflects the **root cause** of the vulnerability: the **storage of user credentials in plaintext**. The vulnerability description explicitly states this **weakness**, making CWE-256 the most appropriate choice.\n\nThe Retriever Results and Complete CWE Specifications were crucial in making this determination. The retriever identified several potential CWEs, but CWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password) had a high score and directly matched the vulnerability description. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-256 also supports its use, stating that it is at the Base level of abstraction, which is preferred.\n\nCWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials) and CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information) were considered as secondary candidates because they are related to the insecure storage of sensitive information. However, they are more general than CWE-256. Since the vulnerability description specifically mentions plaintext storage of passwords, CWE-256 is the most accurate and specific representation of the weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
