Specifically, the 'username' parameter is directly used in SQL queries without sanitization or validation.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- SQL injection vulnerability in the 'admin/index.php' file\n- Insufficient user input validation of the 'username' parameter\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- Unauthorized database access\n- Sensitive data leakage\n- Data tampering\n- Comprehensive system control\n- Service interruption\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- By injecting malicious SQL code through the 'username' parameter in a POST request to 'admin/index.php'.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- The attacker does not need login credentials or authorization.\n- Ability to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint",
