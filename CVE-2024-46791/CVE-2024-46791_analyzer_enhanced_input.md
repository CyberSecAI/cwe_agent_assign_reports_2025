## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved can mcp251x fix **deadlock** if an interrupt occurs during mcp251x_open The mcp251x_hw_wake() function is called with the mpc_lock mutex held and disables the interrupt handler so that no interrupts can be processed while waking the device. If an interrupt has already occurred then waiting for the interrupt handler to complete will **deadlock** because it will be trying to acquire the same mutex. CPU0 CPU1 ---- ---- mcp251x_open() mutex_lock(&priv->mcp_lock) request_threaded_irq() mcp251x_can_ist() mutex_lock(&priv->mcp_lock) mcp251x_hw_wake() disable_irq() <-- **deadlock** Use disable_irq_nosync() instead because the interrupt handler does everything while holding the mutex so it doesnt matter if its still running.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **improper use of disable_irq() function**
- **weakness:** **deadlock**
- **impact:** deadlock
- **vector:** interrupt occurs during mcp251x_open
- **product:** Linux kernel
- **component:** mcp251x driver

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, this CVE relates to a deadlock in the `mcp251x` driver within the Linux kernel.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The `mcp251x_hw_wake()` function, responsible for waking up the MCP251x CAN controller, was using `disable_irq()` while holding the `mcp_lock` mutex. This could lead to a deadlock if an interrupt occurred before `disable_irq()` was called, specifically when an interrupt handler `mcp251x_can_ist()` was already running and attempting to acquire the same `mcp_lock` mutex.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Deadlock:** The primary vulnerability is a deadlock condition arising from incorrect interrupt disabling and mutex usage.
- **Race Condition:** The vulnerability is triggered by a race condition between the execution of `mcp251x_open()` and the occurrence of a CAN interrupt.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **System Hang/Denial of Service:** The deadlock would cause the system to hang, leading to a denial-of-service condition. The CAN interface becomes non-operational, impacting any dependent functionalities.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Interrupt Timing:**  The attack vector involves triggering a CAN interrupt at a specific time while the `mcp251x_open()` function is being executed and  has acquired the `mcp_lock` mutex.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **CAN communication:** The attacker would need the ability to send/receive CAN messages to cause the race condition.
- **Driver Interaction:** The attacker doesn't directly exploit the driver but relies on specific timing within the normal usage of the CAN interface.

**Technical details:**

The following sequence highlights the deadlock scenario:

```
CPU0                       CPU1
----                       ----
mcp251x_open()
mutex_lock(&priv->mcp_lock)
request_threaded_irq()
                            <interrupt>
                            mcp251x_can_ist()
                            mutex_lock(&priv->mcp_lock)
mcp251x_hw_wake()
disable_irq()    <-- deadlock because CPU1 is waiting for mcp_lock
```

**Fix:**

The fix replaces `disable_irq()` with `disable_irq_nosync()` which avoids the deadlock as it doesn't wait for the interrupt handler to complete before disabling the interrupt, since the interrupt handler already holds the required mutex.
