  "description": "i-Educar is free, fully online school management software that can be used by school secretaries, teachers, coordinators, and area managers. A SQL Injection vulnerability was found prior to the 2.9 branch in the `ieducar/intranet/funcionario_vinculo_det.php` file, which creates the query by concatenating the unsanitized GET parameter `cod_func`, allowing the attacker to obtain sensitive information such as emails and password hashes. Commit 7824b95745fa2da6476b9901041d9c854bf52ffe fixes the issue.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\n*   The vulnerability stems from the construction of a SQL query through string concatenation, using a user-controlled GET parameter (`cod_func`) without proper sanitization or parameterization.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the direct incorporation of user input into the SQL query.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   **Full database access:** A successful SQL injection attack could allow an attacker to gain complete and unrestricted access to the database.\n*   **Data exfiltration:** Attackers can potentially retrieve sensitive information, such as user emails and password hashes.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   **HTTP GET parameter manipulation:** The attacker injects malicious SQL code via the `cod_func` GET parameter.\n*   **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, meaning the attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to access the vulnerable page.\n*   **Basic web request knowledge:** The attacker must be able to manipulate GET parameters in HTTP requests.\n*   **SQL knowledge:** The attacker needs to have some knowledge of SQL to craft the injection payload.\n\n**Additional details:**\n\n*   The vulnerable code is located in the `ieducar/intranet/funcionario_vinculo_det.php` file, specifically on line 17.\n*   The provided PoC demonstrates how to use `sqlmap` to exploit this vulnerability.\n*   The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 8.8, classified as high severity, and is assigned CVE-2024-45059.\n*   The vulnerability is present in i-Educar version 2.9 and has no patch available, as of the provided document.\n*   The provided content recommends the use of prepared statements as the proper mitigation technique for this vulnerability.\n\nThe provided content gives significant details and context compared to a standard CVE description.",

The vulnerability involves the **improper sanitization** of the `cod_func` GET parameter, leading to **SQL injection**. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship that impacted the decision was the hierarchical relationship of CWE-89 as a child of CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')). However, CWE-89 is more specific and directly addresses SQL injection, making it a better fit.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    \n    cwe89 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe89 primary\n    class cwe74 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper sanitization** of the `cod_func` GET parameter, leading directly to an **SQL injection** vulnerability. This allows an attacker to gain full database access and exfiltrate sensitive information. The chain is: Improper Input Sanitization -> SQL Injection -> Information Disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is strongly based on the provided evidence. The \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" clearly indicate \"**improper input sanitization**\" as the root cause and \"**SQL injection**\" as the weakness. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms that the vulnerability stems from constructing an SQL query using a user-controlled GET parameter without proper sanitization. The retriever results also strongly suggest CWE-89 as the primary candidate. The hierarchical relationship analysis and chain analysis further support this choice. The chosen CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the SQL injection vulnerability, rather than a more generic weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.
