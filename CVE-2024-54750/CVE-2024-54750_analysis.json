CWE-259 is a variant of CWE-798, providing a more specific classification when the **hardcoded credential** is explicitly a password. Given the vulnerability description explicitly mentions a **hardcoded password**, using the more specific CWE-259 is appropriate.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe259[\"CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password\"]\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n\n    cwe259 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe259 primary\n    class cwe798 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **hardcoded password** (CWE-259). This allows an attacker to bypass normal authentication mechanisms, leading to unauthorized root access.\n\nCWE-259 (Root Cause: **Hardcoded Password**) -> Privilege Escalation (Impact: Root Access)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the explicit statement in the vulnerability description that a **hardcoded password** exists in the `/etc/shadow` file. The phrase \"**hardcoded password**\" is strong evidence supporting the selection of CWE-259.\n\nThe retriever results also support this selection. CWE-259 is listed as the top combined result.\n\nThe graph relationships confirm that CWE-259 is a more specific variant of CWE-798, which is appropriate given the explicit mention of a password.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, as CWE-259 directly addresses the **root cause** (the presence of a **hardcoded password**), while CWE-798 serves as a broader, less precise alternative.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-259: Use of
