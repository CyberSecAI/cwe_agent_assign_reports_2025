A malicious server sends a crafted invite to a vulnerable Synapse server.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to control a malicious federated Matrix server. They do not require any privileges on the target server. No user interaction is needed to trigger the vulnerability.",

The vulnerability stems from a failure to properly validate invites received over federation. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship that influenced the decision was the parent-child relationship. CWE-20 is a class-level CWE, and while more specific CWEs exist, the description focuses on the general lack of validation. Since the vulnerability description doesn't provide specific details on the type of input that isn't being validated beyond \"invites received over federation\", a more specific base CWE cannot be definitively selected.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe20 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is relatively simple:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Improper input validation** (CWE-20) of federated invites.\n2.  **Impact:** Disruption of the `/sync` functionality, effectively breaking the user's ability to synchronize.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis indicates a clear case of **improper input validation** (CWE-20). The vulnerability description and CVE reference links content summary both highlight the failure to properly validate invites received over federation as the root cause. The lack of proper validation allows a malicious server to send a specially crafted invite that disrupts the invited user's `/sync` functionality.\n\nThe retriever results listed several potential CWEs, including CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling), CWE-772 (Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime), CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')), CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption), CWE-1333 (Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity), CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input), CWE-290 (Authentication Bypass by Spoofing), CWE-346 (Origin Validation Error), and CWE-113 (Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')). However, none of these CWEs directly address the **root cause** of the vulnerability, which is the **improper validation** of input.\n\nCWE-20 is chosen because the root cause is **improper input validation**. The vulnerability description specifically states: \"Synapse versions before 1.120.1 fail to properly validate invites received over federation.\" This is direct evidence supporting the selection of CWE-20. While it's a class-level CWE, the available information doesn't allow for a more specific base CWE to be chosen with high confidence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-346: Origin Validation Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly verify that the source of data or communication is valid.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-290: Authentication Bypass by Spoofing\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThis attack-focused weakness is caused by incorrectly implemented authentication schemes that are subject to spoofing attacks.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-941: Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product creates a communication channel to initiate an outgoing request to an actor, but it does not correctly specify the intended destination for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-294: Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA capture-replay flaw exists when the design of the product makes it possible for a malicious user to sniff network traffic and bypass authentication by replaying it to the server in question to the same effect as the original message (or with minor changes).\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web server receives a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
