This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of PDF-XChange Editor. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of EMF files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.

    "enhanced_query": "# Vulnerability Description\n\n    PDF-XChange Editor EMF File Parsing **Out-Of-Bounds Read** **Information Disclosure Vulnerability**. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of PDF-XChange Editor. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of EMF files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-24314.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'lack of proper validation of user-supplied data'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1.
