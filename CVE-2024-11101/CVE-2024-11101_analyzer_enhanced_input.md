**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a SQL injection found in the `/admin/search-invoices.php` file of the "Beauty Parlour Management System PHP SQLite Project."
- The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization and validation of the `searchdata` parameter. User-supplied input is directly used in SQL queries without being cleaned or validated, allowing for the injection of malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability exists in the `/admin/search-invoices.php` file due to unsanitized user input.
- The `searchdata` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthorized database access.
- Sensitive data leakage.
- Data tampering/modification/deletion.
- Comprehensive system control, potentially leading to service interruption.
- Serious threat to system security and business continuity.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the HTTP POST request to the `/admin/search-invoices.php` file.
- The attacker manipulates the `searchdata` parameter within the POST request to inject malicious SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated or authorized to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable server.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided content includes a sample payload for exploitation using SQLMap, showcasing both time-based blind SQL injection and UNION query injection.
- The content also includes suggested remediations:
    - Using prepared statements and parameter binding.
    - Implementing strict input validation and filtering.
    - Minimizing database user permissions.
    - Regular security audits.
