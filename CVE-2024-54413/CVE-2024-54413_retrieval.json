WordPress Display Future Posts plugin (versions <= 0.2.3) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).\\n- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to potentially force higher-privileged users to perform unwanted actions.\\n- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful CSRF attack could enable a malicious actor to force an authenticated user to execute actions under their current authentication.\\n- **Attack vectors**: The attack is launched by tricking an authenticated user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious site that will then make requests to the vulnerable plugin.\\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability by tricking a logged-in user into performing an action.', similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {}, 'top_cwes_by_threshold':
