  "query": "Foxit PDF Reader AcroForm Memory Corruption Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Foxit PDF Reader. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the handling of AcroForms. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a memory corruption condition. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-25345. Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-121 CWE-416 CWE-1284 CWE-787 CWE-316 CWE-122 CWE-20 CWE-788",
