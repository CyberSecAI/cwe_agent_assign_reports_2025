# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-32968

## Vulnerability Description
XWiki is a generic wiki platform. In versions starting from 1.6-milestone-1 to before 15.10.16, 16.4.6, and 16.10.1, it is possible for a user with SCRIPT right to escape from the HQL execution context and perform a blind SQL injection to execute arbitrary SQL statements on the database backend. Depending on the used database backend, the attacker may be able to not only obtain confidential information such as password hashes from the database, but also execute UPDATE/INSERT/DELETE queries. This issue has been patched in versions 16.10.1, 16.4.6 and 15.10.16. There is no known workaround, other than upgrading XWiki. The protection added to this REST API is the same as the one used to validate complete select queries, making it more consistent. However, while the script API always had this protection for complete queries, its important to note that its a very strict protection and some valid, but complex, queries might suddenly require the author to have programming right.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **blind SQL injection, SQL injection**
- **product:** XWiki
- **impact:** ['execute arbitrary SQL statements on the database backend', 'insert', 'delete queries', 'obtain confidential information', 'password hashes', 'execute UPDATE/INSERT/DELETE queries', 'obtain confidential information', 'execute arbitrary SQL statements']
- **attacker:** user with SCRIPT right
- **version:** 1.6-milestone-1 to before 15.10.16, 16.4.6, and 16.10.1

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
```text
**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the short form select requests through the script query API. The secure query manager, which prevents such injections, is not applied when using these short form queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
SQL injection

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker with SCRIPT right can execute arbitrary SQL statements on the database backend, potentially obtaining confidential information (like password hashes) or executing UPDATE/INSERT/DELETE queries.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting malicious queries using the script query API.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs SCRIPT right.

**Mitigation or fix:**
Patched in versions 16.10.1, 16.4.6, and 15.10.16.
