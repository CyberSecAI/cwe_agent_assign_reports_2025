CWE-78 is a specific type of command injection that targets the operating system, making it a more precise classification than the more general CWE-77.\nCWE-20 represents a high-level weakness related to the **insufficient parameter sanitization** and is added as a secondary weakness in this case.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    \n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n    cwe77 -->|ParentOf| cwe78\n    cwe20 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe78\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe20 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **insufficient parameter sanitization** (CWE-20), which leads to **command injection** (CWE-78). The lack of proper input validation allows an attacker to inject malicious commands into the system, resulting in arbitrary code execution.\n  - Root cause: **insufficient parameter sanitization**\n  - Weakness: **command injection**\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that an unauthenticated attacker can conduct a **command injection** attack due to **insufficient parameter sanitization** in the NuPoint Messenger (NPM) component of Mitel MiCollab. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also mentions that the **root cause of the vulnerability** is command injection.\n\nThe Retriever Results identified CWE-77 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')) as the top candidate. While CWE-77 is relevant, CWE-78 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')) is a more specific classification as it involves OS commands. Given that the vulnerability description mentions a **command injection** attack, and the **insufficient parameter sanitization** likely leads to the execution of OS commands, CWE-78 is the more appropriate choice. CWE-20 is added as a secondary weakness since **insufficient parameter sanitization** is mentioned as a **root cause**.\n\nThe decision to select CWE-78 is based on the following evidence:\n- Vulnerability Description: \"allows an unauthenticated attacker to conduct a **command injection** attack due to **insufficient parameter sanitization**.\"\n- CVE Reference Links Content Summary: \"A command injection vulnerability exists in the NuPoint Unified Messaging (NPM) component of Mitel MiCollab.\"\n\nThe CWEs selected are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-78 is a Base level CWE that describes the specific type of command injection vulnerability present, while CWE-20 highlights the **root cause** of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
