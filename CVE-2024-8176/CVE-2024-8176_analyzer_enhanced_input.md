# Vulnerability Description

    A **stack overflow** vulnerability exists in the libexpat library due to the way it handles recursive entity expansion in XML documents. When parsing an XML document with deeply nested entity references, libexpat can be forced to recurse indefinitely, exhausting the stack space and causing a crash. This issue could lead to denial of service (DoS) or, in some cases, **exploitable memory corruption**, depending on the environment and library usage.

    ## WEAKNESS: 'exploitable memory corruption'

Relevant CWEs for this WEAKNESS:

### 1. CWE-776: Improper Restriction of Recursive Entity References in DTDs ('XML Entity Expansion') (Score: 570.27)

The product uses XML documents and allows their structure to be defined with a Document Type Definition (DTD), but it does not properly control the number of recursive definitions of entities....

### 2. CWE-674: Uncontrolled Recursion (Score: 482.85)

The product does not properly control the amount of recursion that takes place,  consuming excessive resources, such as allocated memory or the program stack....

### 3. CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound (Score: 441.42)

The product performs a calculation that can
         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic
         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than
         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is
         incremented to a value that is too large to st...

### 4. CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow (Score: 409.49)

A stack-based buffer overflow condition is a condition where the buffer being overwritten is allocated on the stack (i.e., is a local variable or, rarely, a parameter to a function)....

### 5. CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference (Score: 404.66)

The product processes an XML document that can contain XML entities with URIs that resolve to documents outside of the intended sphere of control, causing the product to embed incorrect documents into its output....
