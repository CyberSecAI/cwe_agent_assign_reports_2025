**Attack vectors:**
Exploitation through the "id" parameter in the `edit_act.php` file via GET requests.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be able to send crafted GET requests to the `edit_act.php` file.

**Mitigation or fix:**
The content does not provide a specific fix, but implies the need for proper input cleaning and validation before using user-supplied data in database queries.

**Payload examples:**
