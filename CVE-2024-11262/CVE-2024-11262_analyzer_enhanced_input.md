## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability has been found in SourceCodester Student Record Management System 1.0 and classified as critical. Affected by this vulnerability is the function main of the component View All Student Marks. The manipulation leads to **stack-based buffer overflow**. It is possible to launch the attack on the local host. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **stack-based buffer overflow**
- **product:** SourceCodester Student Record Management System
- **version:** 1
- **component:** View All Student Marks

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content relates to CVE-2024-11262.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Student Record Management System in C++ has multiple stack-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities due to the use of fixed-size char arrays for storing user input and file contents without proper length checks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities in the "Add New Students" feature when assigning data to a fixed-size char array (data[15]) without length checks.
- Stack-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities in the "View All Student Marks" feature when reading data into a fixed-size char array (data[20]) from a file without length checks.
- Lack of input length validation for both user input and file content.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Program crashes due to memory access errors.
- Potential arbitrary code execution by overwriting control flow data on the stack.
- Data corruption in adjacent memory locations, leading to unpredictable program behavior and system instability.

**Attack vectors:**
- Providing input exceeding the size of the fixed-size char array during the "Add New Students" feature.
- Modifying the student_record.txt file to contain data exceeding the buffer limits for the "View All Student Marks" feature.
-  Crafting inputs to overwrite control flow data on the stack.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the application, either by providing direct input or by modifying the data files used by the application.
- Basic understanding of buffer overflow vulnerabilities and ability to craft suitable input.
