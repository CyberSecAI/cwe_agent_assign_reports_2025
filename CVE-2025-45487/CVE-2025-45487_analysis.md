# Analysis for CVE-2025-45487

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-78 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-78, which is a base CWE. CWE-78 is a child of CWE-77 and CWE-74, but since the description specifically mentions "OS command injection," CWE-78 is the most accurate and specific choice.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **improper neutralization** of special elements used in an OS command, leading to **command injection**.

## Summary of Analysis
The vulnerability description explicitly mentions a **command injection** vulnerability in the `runtime.InternetConnection` function of the Linksys E5600 router. The key phrase "command injection" strongly suggests CWE-78 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')). The Retriever Results also list CWE-78 as a highly relevant CWE. While CWE-77 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')) is also a possibility, CWE-78 is more specific since the vulnerability is in an OS command.

The evidence is the vulnerability description itself: "Linksys E5600 v1.1.0.26 was discovered to contain a **command injection** vulnerability in the runtime.InternetConnection function."

Based on the evidence and the retriever results, CWE-78 is the most appropriate CWE. Other CWEs were considered but deemed less relevant:

*   CWE-77: This is a more general form of command injection. Since the description specifies OS command injection, CWE-78 is more specific.
*   CWE-74: This is a very general injection CWE and is discouraged.
*   CWE-88: Argument injection is different from command injection.
*   CWE-79: Cross-site scripting is not related to command injection.
* CWE-1336: Template injection is not related to OS command injection.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as "<", ">", and "&" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-134: Use of Externally-Controlled Format String
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a function that accepts a format string as an argument, but the format string originates from an external source.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-790: Improper Filtering of Special Elements
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives data from an upstream component, but does not filter or incorrectly filters special elements before sending it to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.



## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-88: Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs a string for a command to be executed by a separate component
in another control sphere, but it does not properly delimit the
intended arguments, options, or switches within that command string.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-346: Origin Validation Error
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly verify that the source of data or communication is valid.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-294: Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A capture-replay flaw exists when the design of the product makes it possible for a malicious user to sniff network traffic and bypass authentication by replaying it to the server in question to the same effect as the original message (or with minor changes).

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 587.23
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might
