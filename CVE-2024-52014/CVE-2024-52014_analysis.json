It is a plausible secondary CWE as it describes the mechanism of the **overflow**.\n\nCWE-120 is considered because copying a buffer without checking its size is a common cause of buffer overflows. However, since the description specifically says \"**stack overflow**\", CWE-121 is a more precise fit.\n\nBased on the evidence, relationship analysis, and mapping guidance, CWE-121 is the most appropriate primary CWE, with CWE-787 and CWE-120 as secondary candidates.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA stack-based buffer overflow condition is a condition where the buffer being overwritten is allocated on the stack (i.e., is a local variable or, rarely, a parameter to a function).\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 3.89\n**Source**: graph\n\n**Description**:\nCWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.",
