  "query": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved erofs handle overlapped pclusters out of crafted images properly syzbot reported a task hang issue due to a deadlock case where it is waiting for the folio lock of a cached folio that will be used for cache I/Os. After looking into the crafted fuzzed image, I found its formed with several overlapped big pclusters as below Ext logical offset | length physical offset | length 0 0.. 16384 | 16384 151552.. 167936 | 16384 1 16384.. 32768 | 16384 155648.. 172032 | 16384 2 32768.. 49152 | 16384 537223168.. 537239552 | 16384 ... Here, extent 0/1 are physically overlapped although its entirely _impossible_ for normal filesystem images generated by mkfs. First, managed folios containing compressed data will be marked as up-to-date and then unlocked immediately (unlike in-place folios) when compressed I/Os are complete. If physical blocks are not submitted in the incremental order, there should be separate BIOs to avoid dependency issues. However, the current code mis-arranges z_erofs_fill_bio_vec() and BIO submission which causes unexpected BIO waits. Second, managed folios will be connected to their own pclusters for efficient inter-queries. However, this is somewhat hard to implement easily if overlapped big pclusters exist. Again, these only appear in fuzzed images so lets simply fall back to temporary short-lived pages",
