# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-56330

## Vulnerability Description
Stardust is a platform for streaming isolated desktop containers. With this exploit, **inter container communication** (ICC) is not disabled. This would allow users within a container to access another containers agent, therefore compromising access.The problem has been patched in any Stardust build past 12/20/24. Users are advised to upgrade. Users may also manually disable ICC if they are unable to upgrade.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **inter container communication**
- **impact:** access another containers agent
- **attacker:** users within a container
- **product:** Stardust

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The root cause is the lack of disabled inter-container communication (ICC) within the Stardust container network. This means containers on the same network can communicate with each other without proper isolation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Missing Inter-Container Communication (ICC) Restriction:** The primary weakness is the failure to disable ICC on the Stardust network. Docker networks, by default, allow containers on the same network to communicate. This lack of restriction allows unauthorized access between containers.
- **Insufficient Isolation:**  The containers within the Stardust network are not sufficiently isolated from each other.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Compromised Access:** An attacker within one container can potentially access the agent of another container.
- **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact:** The CVSS v4 metrics indicate high impact to Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability of the vulnerable system.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network, meaning an attacker within any container connected to the vulnerable network could initiate the attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Access to a Container on the Same Network:** The attacker must have access to at least one container within the vulnerable Stardust network.
- **No Special Privileges Required:** The attacker does not require any specific privileges on the target system to exploit the vulnerability.
- **No User Interaction:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability without needing any interaction from other users.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided content includes suggested workarounds, which involve recreating the Docker network with the `--opt "com.docker.network.bridge.enable_icc"="false"` option and reconnecting the containers.
- The vulnerability has been assigned a CVSS v4 score of 9.3, which is considered critical.
- The CVE ID associated with this vulnerability is CVE-2024-56330.
- The weakness is categorized as CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)

This analysis provides detailed information about the vulnerability, including its causes, impacts, attack vectors, and mitigations.
