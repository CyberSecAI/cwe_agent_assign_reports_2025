## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability was identified in the kjd/idna library, specifically within the `idna.encode()` function, affecting version 3.6. The issue arises from the functions handling of crafted input strings, which can lead to **quadratic complexity** and consequently, a denial of service condition. This vulnerability is triggered by a crafted input that causes the `idna.encode()` function to process the input with considerable computational load, significantly increasing the processing time in a quadratic manner relative to the input size.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **quadratic complexity**
- **impact:** denial of service
- **vector:** crafted input strings
- **product:** kjd/idna library
- **version:** 3.6
- **component:** idna.encode() function

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-3651:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an issue in the `encode()` function of the `idna` library. Specially crafted inputs to this function could lead to an exceptionally long processing time.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Algorithmic Complexity Issue/DoS:** The core vulnerability is a performance issue. Specific inputs cause the `encode()` function to take an unreasonable amount of time, making it a Denial-of-Service (DoS) vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can exploit the vulnerability to cause a denial of service by providing malicious inputs to the `encode()` function. This could render applications using the `idna` library unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Input:** Attackers provide specially crafted, malicious strings as input to the `encode()` function of the `idna` library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide the malicious input to the affected `encode()` function. This could happen if user-provided data is passed to this function without sanitization or rate-limiting.
