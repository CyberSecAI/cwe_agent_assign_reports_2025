The issue arises from the functions handling of crafted input strings, which can lead to quadratic complexity and consequently, a denial of service condition. This vulnerability is triggered by a crafted input that causes the `idna.encode()` function to process the input with considerable computational load, significantly increasing the processing time in a quadratic manner relative to the input size. Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-834 CWE-1284 CWE-770 CWE-190 CWE-1333 CWE-407",
