# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-45165
## Query
An issue was discovered in UCI IDOL 2 (aka uciIDOL or IDOL2) through 2.12. Data is sent between client and server with encryption. However, the key is derived from the string (c)2007 UCI Software GmbH B.Boll (without quotes). The key is both static and hardcoded. With access to messages, this results in message decryption and encryption by an attacker. Thus, it enables passive and active man-in-the-middle attacks.

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: 'static', 'hardcoded key'
