  "description": "An issue was discovered in UCI IDOL 2 (aka uciIDOL or IDOL2) through 2.12. Data is sent between client and server with encryption. However, the key is derived from the string (c)2007 UCI Software GmbH B.Boll (without quotes). The key is both static and hardcoded. With access to messages, this results in message decryption and encryption by an attacker. Thus, it enables passive and active man-in-the-middle attacks.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-45165:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\n*   The vulnerability stems from the use of a hardcoded, static cryptographic key within the IDOL2 client application. The key is derived from the string \"(c)2007 UCI Software GmbH B.Boll\".\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key (CWE-321):** The encryption key is embedded directly in the application's code.\n*   **Symmetric Encryption:** The use of a symmetric encryption algorithm means that the same key is used for encryption and decryption, and compromising the key allows both.\n*   **Static Key:** The encryption key is static and does not change, making it easily reusable once discovered.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Passive MitM Attacks:** Attackers can intercept encrypted communication between the IDOL2 client and server, and decrypt the messages to access sensitive data.\n*   **Active MitM Attacks:** Attackers can not only decrypt messages, but also encrypt their own messages using the static key, enabling them to inject malicious data or commands into the communication stream. This could potentially lead to unauthorized access, data manipulation, or disruption of services.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** An attacker needs to be positioned on the network path between the IDOL2 client and the server to intercept the encrypted communication. This could be on a local network or a compromised remote network.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to intercept communication.\n*   **Knowledge of the Hardcoded Key:** The attacker needs to know that the key is derived from the specific string and obtain the corresponding cryptographic key.\n*   **Ability to Intercept and Manipulate Network Traffic:** The attacker needs tools and knowledge to perform MitM attacks.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n* The advisory indicates that the issue affects IDOL2 versions up to and including 2.12.\n* The vendor was notified on 2024-06-26, but did not resolve the issue before public disclosure on 2024-08-19.\n* The vulnerability was discovered by SySS GmbH.\n* The advisory includes links to the product website, the SySS advisory, and the IDOL2 client download.",

The vulnerability involves the use of a **hardcoded key**, which directly aligns with CWE-321. Since this key is used for encryption, the sensitive data is transmitted in cleartext when the key is compromised. Therefore, CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information) is also considered.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe321[\"CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key\"]\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n\n    cwe321 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n    cwe319\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe321 primary\n    class cwe319 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **hardcoded cryptographic key** (CWE-321), which leads to the ability to decrypt and encrypt messages by an attacker, resulting in **cleartext transmission of sensitive information** (CWE-319) and enabling man-in-the-middle attacks.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly points to CWE-321 as the primary weakness, given the explicit mention of a **static and hardcoded key**. The high retriever score for CWE-321 supports this. The evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference links clearly indicates the presence of a hardcoded cryptographic key.\n\nCWE-319 is included because the **hardcoded key** leads to the possibility of **cleartext transmission of sensitive information** if the key is compromised.\n\nCWE-327 (Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm) was considered but not selected, as the primary issue is not the algorithm itself but the **hardcoded key**.\n\nCWE-203 (Observable Discrepancy) and CWE-208 (Observable Timing Discrepancy) were considered less relevant because the core issue is not about observable discrepancies but the **hardcoded key**.\n\nCWE-1204 (Generation of Weak Initialization Vector (IV)) was considered, but it doesn't directly apply because the issue isn't about IV generation but the **static cryptographic key**.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-321 being a Variant and CWE-319 being a Base CWE. This provides a detailed representation of the vulnerability's root cause and its direct consequence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe use of a hard-coded cryptographic key significantly increases the possibility that encrypted data may be recovered.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
