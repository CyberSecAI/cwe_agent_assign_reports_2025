# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-45165

## Vulnerability Description
An issue was discovered in UCI IDOL 2 (aka uciIDOL or IDOL2) through 2.12. Data is sent between client and server with encryption. However, the key is derived from the string (c)2007 UCI Software GmbH B.Boll (without quotes). The key is both static and hardcoded. With access to messages, this results in message decryption and encryption by an attacker. Thus, it enables passive and active man-in-the-middle attacks.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **static and hardcoded key**
- **impact:** man-in-the-middle attacks and message decryption and message encryption
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** UCI IDOL
- **version:** 2 through 2.12

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-45165:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the use of a hardcoded, static cryptographic key within the IDOL2 client application. The key is derived from the string "(c)2007 UCI Software GmbH B.Boll".

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key (CWE-321):** The encryption key is embedded directly in the application's code.
*   **Symmetric Encryption:** The use of a symmetric encryption algorithm means that the same key is used for encryption and decryption, and compromising the key allows both.
*   **Static Key:** The encryption key is static and does not change, making it easily reusable once discovered.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Passive MitM Attacks:** Attackers can intercept encrypted communication between the IDOL2 client and server, and decrypt the messages to access sensitive data.
*   **Active MitM Attacks:** Attackers can not only decrypt messages, but also encrypt their own messages using the static key, enabling them to inject malicious data or commands into the communication stream. This could potentially lead to unauthorized access, data manipulation, or disruption of services.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** An attacker needs to be positioned on the network path between the IDOL2 client and the server to intercept the encrypted communication. This could be on a local network or a compromised remote network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to intercept communication.
*   **Knowledge of the Hardcoded Key:** The attacker needs to know that the key is derived from the specific string and obtain the corresponding cryptographic key.
*   **Ability to Intercept and Manipulate Network Traffic:** The attacker needs tools and knowledge to perform MitM attacks.

**Additional Notes:**
* The advisory indicates that the issue affects IDOL2 versions up to and including 2.12.
* The vendor was notified on 2024-06-26, but did not resolve the issue before public disclosure on 2024-08-19.
* The vulnerability was discovered by SySS GmbH.
* The advisory includes links to the product website, the SySS advisory, and the IDOL2 client download.
