This may lead to complete system compromise, data theft, or denial of service.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n-  The application's web interface allows users to enter visualization parameters as a dictionary. This input is then processed by the `eval()` function.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- The attacker needs to access the application's web interface and have the ability to input data into the \"Enter visualization parameters as a dictionary\" field.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n- The vulnerability is present in the file `pages/10_\ud83c\udf0d_Earth_Engine_Datasets.py` on line 126.\n- The vulnerability can be exploited by entering malicious code as visualization parameters, which the application then executes via `eval()`.\n- The fix involves replacing `eval()` with `json.loads()` after sanitizing the input",

The vulnerability stems directly from using `eval()` with unsanitized input, making CWE-95 the most specific and appropriate choice. CWE-20 is a broader category and less precise, but it represents the underlying **lack of input validation** that allows the `eval` injection to occur.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe95[\"CWE-95: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection')\"]\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    \n    cwe95 -->|CHILDOF| cwe94\n    cwe95 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    cwe94 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe95 primary\n    class cwe20 secondary\n    class cwe94 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper input validation** (CWE-20), which leads to the use of the `eval()` function with unsanitized user input. This results in the ability to inject code (CWE-95), ultimately leading to remote code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that the `vis_params` variable takes user input, which is then used in the `eval()` function without proper sanitization. This perfectly aligns with the definition of CWE-95. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this by stating that the root cause is the use of `eval()` on unsanitized user input.\n\nWhile several CWEs were considered based on retriever results, CWE-95 stands out as the most accurate and specific representation of the vulnerability. The relationship analysis confirms that CWE-95 is a variant of CWE-94 and a child of CWE-20, but it's the most specific of the three and thus the best choice.\n\nCWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) was also considered as an underlying cause, and while valid, it is a more general weakness. The primary issue is the direct use of `eval()` with unsanitized input, thus CWE-95 is the primary CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
