The retriever results also strongly suggest this CWE. There are no other significant hierarchical or chain relationships to consider in this case, as the description focuses on a single, direct weakness.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe476[\"CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    \n    class cwe476 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is simple: a **NULL pointer access** leads to a crash or unexpected behavior. There are no preceding or following weaknesses mentioned in the description.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the direct evidence provided in the vulnerability description, which explicitly mentions \"**NULL pointer access**\".
