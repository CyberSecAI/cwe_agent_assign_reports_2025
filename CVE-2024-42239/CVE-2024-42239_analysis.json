  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved bpf Fail bpf_timer_cancel when callback is being cancelled Given a schedule timer1 cbtimer2 cb bpf_timer_cancel(timer2)bpf_timer_cancel(timer1) Both bpf_timer_cancel calls would wait for the other callback to finish executing, introducing a lockup. Add an atomic_t count named cancelling in bpf_hrtimer. This keeps track of all in-flight cancellation requests for a given BPF timer. Whenever cancelling a BPF timer, we must check if we have outstanding cancellation requests, and if so, we must fail the operation with an error (-EDEADLK) since cancellation is synchronous and waits for the callback to finish executing. This implies that we can enter a **deadlock** situation involving two or more timer callbacks executing in parallel and attempting to cancel one another. Note that we avoid incrementing the cancelling counter for the target timer (the one being cancelled) if bpf_timer_cancel is not invoked from a callback, to avoid spurious errors. The whole point of detecting cur->cancelling and returning -EDEADLK is to not enter a busy wait loop (which may or may not lead to a lockup). This does not apply in case the caller is in a non-callback context, the other side can continue to cancel as it sees fit without running into errors. Background on prior attempts Earlier versions of this patch used a bool cancelling bit and used the following pattern under timer->lock to publish cancellation status. l",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from a deadlock condition that can occur when using BPF timers. The `bpf_timer_cancel` function could lead to a deadlock when called from within a timer callback if that callback was also trying to cancel another timer. This is because `bpf_timer_cancel` waits for the timer callback to finish, leading to a situation where two or more timer callbacks are waiting for each other to complete.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n\n*   **Deadlock:** The primary vulnerability is the potential for a deadlock. If two or more BPF timer callbacks try to cancel each other using `bpf_timer_cancel`, they can enter a state where each is waiting for another to finish, and none can proceed.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **System Hang/Lockup:** The most likely impact is a system hang or lockup, as the kernel threads get stuck waiting for each other indefinitely. This could lead to a denial of service.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **BPF Programs:** The vulnerability is exploited by crafting specific BPF programs that use timers and then attempt to cancel the timers in a way that creates the described deadlock scenario.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **BPF Program Loading:** The attacker must be able to load and execute BPF programs on the target system. This usually requires root or CAP_BPF capabilities.\n*   **Control Over Timer Logic:** The attacker needs to control how the BPF timers are created, scheduled, and cancelled to create the deadlock situation.\n*   **Concurrency:** The exploit relies on the concurrent execution of multiple BPF timer callbacks.\n\n**Technical Details:**\n\n*   The fix introduces an `atomic_t cancelling` counter in the `bpf_hrtimer` struct to track in-flight cancellation requests.\n*   When `bpf_timer_cancel` is called from within a callback, it checks if the target timer has any outstanding cancellation requests and returns `-EDEADLK` if it does.\n*   The `cancelling` counter is incremented and decremented to protect the operation, but only when called from a callback. It is not incremented for non-callback contexts to prevent spurious errors.\n* The fix prevents a deadlock by introducing a check in `bpf_timer_cancel` to avoid waiting if the calling context is also attempting to cancel another timer. The code specifically checks if `cur_t == t`, which would indicate a nested `bpf_timer_cancel` within the callback, and prevents the deadlock by immediately returning `-EDEADLK`.\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis vulnerability allows a malicious actor with the ability to load BPF programs to cause a deadlock condition by manipulating BPF timers and their cancellation requests from within the timer callback. The fix introduces a mechanism to prevent such deadlocks by tracking in-flight cancel requests and failing with an error when nested cancellations occur from within a callback.",

The `CVE Reference Links Content Summary` confirms that the primary vulnerability is the potential for a **deadlock**. The technical details section describes the mechanism by which the **deadlock** can occur.\n\nThe final selection of **CWE-833** as the primary CWE reflects the specific nature of the vulnerability and the strong evidence supporting its classification.

The `CVE Reference Links Content Summary` also confirms this. The fix involves preventing the code from entering a busy wait loop, which can lead to a **deadlock**. This aligns directly with the description of **CWE-833**, which involves multiple threads waiting for each other. Confidence: 1.0\n\n**CWE-667 (Improper Locking)**: While the vulnerability does involve locking, the core issue is the resulting **deadlock** rather than a general problem with locking. The description doesn't focus on incorrect acquisition or release of locks, but rather on the circular dependency created by the `bpf_timer_cancel` function. Therefore, **CWE-667** is a secondary candidate. Confidence: 0.7\n\n**CWE-362 (Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition'))**: The vulnerability involves concurrent execution of timer callbacks and a potential race condition in the cancellation process. This could lead to a **deadlock**. The retriever results suggest **CWE-362**, but it is a class-level CWE. **CWE-833** is more specific and a better fit. Therefore, **CWE-362** is a secondary candidate. Confidence: 0.6\n\nOther CWEs Considered and Rejected:\n\n*   **CWE-208, CWE-367, CWE-755, CWE-824, CWE-617, CWE-703, CWE-754, CWE-364, CWE-123, CWE-609, CWE-415, CWE-479, CWE-416, CWE-386, CWE-134, CWE-120, CWE-613**: These CWEs were considered but rejected because they did not directly relate to the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **deadlock** condition. They represent different types of weaknesses or are related to specific scenarios not directly applicable to this vulnerability.",
