  "query": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved mei vsc Fix fortify-panic caused by invalid counted_by() use gcc 15 honors the __counted_by(len) attribute on vsc_tp_packet.buf[] and the vsc-tp.c code is using this in a wrong way. len does not contain the available size in the buffer, it contains the actual packet length *without* the crc. So as soon as vsc_tp_xfer() tries to add the crc to buf[] the fortify-panic handler gets triggered [ 80.842193] memcpy detected buffer overflow 4 byte write of buffer size 0 [ 80.842243] WARNING CPU 4 PID 272 at lib/string_helpers.c1032 __fortify_report+0x45/0x50 ...

Instead of just dropping the counted-by, split the vsc_tp_packet struct definition into a header and a full-packet definition and use a fixed size buf[] in the packet definition, this way fortify-source buffer overrun checking still works when enabled.",
