### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **sql injection**
- **product:** code-projects Farmacia
- **version:** 1
- **component:** /editar-cliente.php

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Root Cause:** The `editar-cliente.php` file in the `farmacia-in-php` project directly concatenates the `$id` parameter into a SQL query without any sanitization or prepared statements.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Unsanitized user input: The `$id` parameter from the GET request is directly used in the SQL query.
- SQL Injection: By manipulating the `$id` parameter, an attacker can inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthorized database access: An attacker can potentially access sensitive data from the database.
- Arbitrary command execution: Through SQL injection, an attacker might be able to execute arbitrary commands on the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP GET request: The vulnerability can be exploited via a crafted HTTP GET request to `editar-cliente.php` with a malicious value for the `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access to the vulnerable application.
- Ability to craft HTTP requests.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided content includes a Proof of Concept (PoC) showing a sample HTTP GET request with a modified `id` parameter (`id=1*`) to demonstrate the SQL injection.
- The vulnerable code is in the `editar-cliente.php` file of the `farmacia-in-php` application.

The provided information gives more details than a placeholder CVE description and accurately describes a SQL injection vulnerability.
