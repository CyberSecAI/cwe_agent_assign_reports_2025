# Analysis for CVE-2025-23677

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-352 | Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) | 1.0 | Compound | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-79 | Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') | 0.7 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is CWE-352 [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)], a compound weakness. The attack leads to Stored XSS which is best represented by CWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')]. While CWE-352 is a compound, attack-oriented CWE, it accurately reflects the **rootcause** as stated in the vulnerability description and CVE reference links. CWE-79 is a consequence of the CSRF, where an attacker uses CSRF to inject malicious scripts that are then stored and executed in the context of other users.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** **rootcause** (CWE-352). An attacker exploits this **weakness** to force a privileged user to perform actions that lead to **Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')** (CWE-79), resulting in stored XSS.
- CWE-352 (Root Cause) -> CWE-79 (Impact)

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment identified CWE-352 as the primary weakness due to the explicit mention of "Cross-Site Request Forgery" in both the vulnerability description and the CVE reference links. The retriever results also listed CWE-352 as the top candidate.

The attack results in Stored XSS so CWE-79 is a secondary weakness.

The evidence directly supports the selection of CWE-352 as the primary **rootcause** and CWE-79 as the secondary weakness.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
**Abstraction Level**: Compound
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.



## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as "<", ">", and "&" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web server receives a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-346: Origin Validation Error
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly verify that the source of data or communication is valid.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives data from an HTTP agent/component (e.g., web server, proxy, browser, etc.), but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CR and LF characters before the data is included in outgoing HTTP headers.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information

**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
