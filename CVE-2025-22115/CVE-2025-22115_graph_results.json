  "query": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved btrfs fix block group refcount race in btrfs_create_pending_block_groups() Block group creation is done in two phases, which results in a slightly unintuitive property a block group can be allocated/deallocated from after btrfs_make_block_group() adds it to the space_info with btrfs_add_bg_to_space_info(), but before creation is completely completed in btrfs_create_pending_block_groups(). As a result, it is possible for a block group to go unused and have btrfs_mark_bg_unused called on it concurrently with btrfs_create_pending_block_groups. This causes a number of issues, which were fixed with the block group flag BLOCK_GROUP_FLAG_NEW. However, this fix is not quite complete. Since it does not use the unused_bg_lock, it is possible for the following race to occur btrfs_create_pending_block_groups btrfs_mark_bg_unused if list_empty // false list_del_init clear_bit else if (test_bit) // true list_move_tail And we get into the exact same broken ref count and invalid new_bgs state for transaction cleanup that BLOCK_GROUP_FLAG_NEW was designed to prevent. The broken refcount aspect will result in a warning like",
