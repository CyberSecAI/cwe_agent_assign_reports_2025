### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **command injection**
- **product:** Shenzhen Tuoshi Network Communications Co.,Ltd 5G CPE Router

- **component:** at_command.asp

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content is related to CVE-2024-48440.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of JBoneOS or JBoneCloud firmware in certain routers. Specifically, the `fac.asp` and `at_command.asp` pages are accessible without any authentication.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
1.  **Unauthenticated factory reset:** The `fac.asp` page allows an attacker to trigger a factory reset without authentication. This resets the device to default settings, enabling SSH access using default credentials (root/root).
2.  **Unauthenticated AT command injection:** The `at_command.asp` page allows an attacker to inject AT commands without authentication.

**Impact of exploitation:**
1.  **Factory Reset:** An attacker can reset the device to its factory settings. This allows SSH login with default credentials, gaining root access to the device.
2.  **AT Command Injection:** An attacker can inject AT commands to extract sensitive information, such as IMEI, IMSI, and other modem information.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerabilities are accessible via the web interface of the router. An attacker can access the vulnerable `fac.asp` and `at_command.asp` pages using an HTTP request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to access the web interface of the affected router, implying they must be on the same network or have access to the router's public IP address. No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerabilities.
