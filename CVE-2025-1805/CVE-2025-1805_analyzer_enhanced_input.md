## Analysis of CVE-2025-1805 related content

**CVE ID:** CVE-2025-1805
**CVE Description:** PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval

**Content analyzed:** perldoc.perl.org_e7a01e99_20250624_151359.html and security.metacpan.org_9d6e4254_20250624_151400.html

**Findings:**

The provided content discusses the `rand` function in Perl and the importance of using cryptographically secure random number generators (CSPRNGs) for security-sensitive applications. It details the weaknesses of the built-in `rand` function and recommends several CPAN modules for generating secure random data.

**Extracted Information:**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The built-in `rand` function in Perl is not suitable for security-sensitive applications because it is seeded by only 32 bits and its output can be easily predicted.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   `rand` function has a small seed size (32 bits).
    *   `rand` output is predictable.
    *   Using `rand` to seed a CSPRNG does not improve security.
*   **Impact of exploitation:**  Using a weak random number generator can compromise the security of applications that rely on randomness for encryption keys, tokens, passwords, and other sensitive data.
*   **Attack vectors:** An attacker could potentially predict the output of `rand` and exploit this predictability to compromise the security of an application.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to observe or influence the seed value of the `rand` function.
*   **Mitigation or fix:**
    *   Do not use the `rand` function for security-sensitive applications.
    *   Use cryptographically secure random number generators (CSPRNGs) provided by CPAN modules such as:
        *   `Crypt::URandom`
        *   `Crypt::SysRandom`
        *   `Sys::GetRandom`
        *   `Crypt::PRNG`
        *   `Math::Random::ISAAC`
    *   Use modules designed for generating tokens and passwords like `Crypt::URandom::Token` and `Session::Token`.

**Note:** The content provides significantly more detail than a typical CVE description, focusing on best practices for secure random number generation in Perl. It is a guide for developers on how to avoid using insecure methods and how to implement secure alternatives.
