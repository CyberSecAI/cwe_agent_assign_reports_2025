  "vulnerability_info": "VulnerabilityInfo(cve_id='CVE-2024-47529', description='OpenC3 COSMOS provides the functionality needed to send commands to and receive data from one or more embedded systems. OpenC3 COSMOS stores the password of a user unencrypted in the LocalStorage of a web browser. This makes the user password susceptible to exfiltration via **Cross-site scripting** (see GHSL-2024-128). This vulnerability is fixed in 5.19.0. This only affects Open Source edition, and not OpenC3 COSMOS Enterprise Edition.', key_phrases={'rootcause': '', 'weakness': ['Cross-site scripting', 'unencrypted storage of sensitive information'], 'impact': 'exfiltration of user password', 'vector': 'cross-site scripting', 'attacker': '', 'product': 'OpenC3 COSMOS', 'version': 'before 5.19.0', 'component': 'Localstorage'}, reference_content=\"Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-47529:\\n\\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\\n\\nThe root cause is the storage of user passwords in clear text within the web browser's LocalStorage. This insecure practice makes the password easily accessible and vulnerable to exfiltration.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\\n\\n*   **Cleartext Storage:** User passwords are not encrypted and are directly stored in the browser's LocalStorage. This is a direct violation of security best practices.\\n*   **Information Disclosure:** The stored password can be readily accessed by malicious scripts or local users who have access to the browser data.\\n\\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\\n\\n*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can gain access to user passwords, which can be used to access the OpenC3 COSMOS application.\\n*   **Account Takeover:** With access to the password, an attacker could fully compromise user accounts, leading to unauthorized control of the system.\\n*   **Persistent Access:** Unlike session tokens that expire, this stored password provides a persistent form of access, allowing the attacker continuous access to the system even after the session expires.\\n\\n**Attack Vectors:**\\n\\n*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** An attacker can exploit XSS vulnerabilities to execute malicious JavaScript within the context of a victim's browser session. This malicious script can then access the LocalStorage to retrieve the stored password.\\n*   **Local Access:** A local user with access to the victim's computer can directly access the browser's LocalStorage and extract the password.\\n\\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\\n\\n*   **XSS Exploitation:** An attacker needs to be able to inject malicious JavaScript into the user's browser session, usually by exploiting a separate XSS vulnerability.\\n*   **Local Access:** A local attacker requires physical access to the user's system or ability to access browser's storage.\\n\\n**Additional Information:**\\n\\n*   The issue affects OpenC3 COSMOS Open Source Edition but not the Enterprise Edition.\\n*   This vulnerability is directly linked to another vulnerability, CVE-2024-43795, where a reflected XSS in login functionality makes this vulnerability easier to exploit.\\n*   The vulnerability was discovered using CodeQL.\\n*   The fix implemented in commit `b5ab34f` addressed this by using session tokens instead of storing the password directly.\\n*   The vulnerability is identified as `GHSL-2024-129`\\n\\nThis analysis provides significantly more detail compared to the placeholder CVE description.\", similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {},

OpenC3 COSMOS stores the password of a user unencrypted in the LocalStorage of a web browser. This makes the user password susceptible to exfiltration via **Cross-site scripting** (see GHSL-2024-128). This vulnerability is fixed in 5.19.0. This only affects Open Source edition, and not OpenC3 COSMOS Enterprise Edition.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## WEAKNESS: 'Cross-site scripting'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this WEAKNESS:\n\n### 1.
