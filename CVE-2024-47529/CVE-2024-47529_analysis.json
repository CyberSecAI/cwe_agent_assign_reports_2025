  "description": "OpenC3 COSMOS provides the functionality needed to send commands to and receive data from one or more embedded systems. OpenC3 COSMOS stores the password of a user unencrypted in the LocalStorage of a web browser. This makes the user password susceptible to exfiltration via **Cross-site scripting** (see GHSL-2024-128). This vulnerability is fixed in 5.19.0. This only affects Open Source edition, and not OpenC3 COSMOS Enterprise Edition.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-47529:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\nThe root cause is the storage of user passwords in clear text within the web browser's LocalStorage. This insecure practice makes the password easily accessible and vulnerable to exfiltration.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Cleartext Storage:** User passwords are not encrypted and are directly stored in the browser's LocalStorage. This is a direct violation of security best practices.\n*   **Information Disclosure:** The stored password can be readily accessed by malicious scripts or local users who have access to the browser data.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can gain access to user passwords, which can be used to access the OpenC3 COSMOS application.\n*   **Account Takeover:** With access to the password, an attacker could fully compromise user accounts, leading to unauthorized control of the system.\n*   **Persistent Access:** Unlike session tokens that expire, this stored password provides a persistent form of access, allowing the attacker continuous access to the system even after the session expires.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** An attacker can exploit XSS vulnerabilities to execute malicious JavaScript within the context of a victim's browser session. This malicious script can then access the LocalStorage to retrieve the stored password.\n*   **Local Access:** A local user with access to the victim's computer can directly access the browser's LocalStorage and extract the password.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **XSS Exploitation:** An attacker needs to be able to inject malicious JavaScript into the user's browser session, usually by exploiting a separate XSS vulnerability.\n*   **Local Access:** A local attacker requires physical access to the user's system or ability to access browser's storage.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n*   The issue affects OpenC3 COSMOS Open Source Edition but not the Enterprise Edition.\n*   This vulnerability is directly linked to another vulnerability, CVE-2024-43795, where a reflected XSS in login functionality makes this vulnerability easier to exploit.\n*   The vulnerability was discovered using CodeQL.\n*   The fix implemented in commit `b5ab34f` addressed this by using session tokens instead of storing the password directly.\n*   The vulnerability is identified as `GHSL-2024-129`\n\nThis analysis provides significantly more detail compared to the placeholder CVE description.",
