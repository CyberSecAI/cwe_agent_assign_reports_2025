The function downloads and extracts `tar.gz` files from URLs without proper sanitization, making it susceptible to a **TarSlip** vulnerability. Attackers can exploit this by crafting malicious tar files that, when extracted, can overwrite files on the victims system via **path traversal** or faked symlinks.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'lack of proper sanitization'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1.
