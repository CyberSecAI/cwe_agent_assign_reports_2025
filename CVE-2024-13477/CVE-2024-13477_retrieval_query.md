# Retrieval Query for CVE-2024-13477

# Vulnerability Description

    The LTL Freight Quotes Unishippers Edition plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the edit_id parameter in all versions up to, and including, 2.5.8 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.

    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis
