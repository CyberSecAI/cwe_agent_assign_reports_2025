# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-6479

## Description

The SIP Reviews Shortcode for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the no_of_reviews attribute in the woocommerce_reviews shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.3 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Rootcause:** insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query
- **Weakness:** SQL injection
- **Impact:** extract sensitive information from the database
- **Attacker:** unauthenticated attackers
- **Product:** SIP Reviews Shortcode for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress
- **Version:** all versions up to and including 1.2.3

|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-89 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that impacts the decision is the hierarchical relationship between CWE-89 and its parent CWEs, specifically CWE-943 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Data Query Logic) and CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used in a Command). While CWE-943 is a class-level CWE that encompasses SQL injection, LDAP injection, and other data query injection vulnerabilities, CWE-89 is a base-level CWE that specifically addresses SQL injection. Given the vulnerability description explicitly mentions SQL injection, CWE-89 is the more specific and appropriate choice. The retriever results also support this decision, with CWE-89 having the highest score.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain begins with **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query** (root cause), leading to **SQL Injection** (weakness), and culminating in the ability to extract sensitive information from the database (impact).

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is based on the provided evidence, which clearly indicates an **SQL Injection** vulnerability. The vulnerability description explicitly states that the plugin is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the `no_of_reviews` attribute due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary further reinforces this by stating that the root cause is insufficient input sanitization and lack of proper SQL query preparation, and the weakness is SQL Injection.

The retriever results also strongly support this, with CWE-89 having a score of 1.0.

The selection of CWE-89 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the type of injection occurring in the application, and there is sufficient evidence.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
**Abstraction Level**: Compound
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.

*   Not used because the vulnerability described is SQL Injection.

## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

*   Not used because the vulnerability described is SQL Injection, where the **lack of escaping** leads to the injection.

## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.67
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*   Not used because the vulnerability described is SQL Injection.

## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.67
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.
