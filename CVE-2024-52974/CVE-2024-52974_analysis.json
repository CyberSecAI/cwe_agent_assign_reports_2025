CWE-770 is a base level CWE and a child of CWE-400. The vulnerability description indicates a Kibana server crash due to a specially crafted request that leads to **uncontrolled resource consumption**. While CWE-400 is a class, the allocation of resource without limits or throttling, which is CWE-770, is a more specific reason for the uncontrolled resource consumption.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    cwe942[\"CWE-942: Permissive Cross-domain Policy with Untrusted Domains\"]\n    cwe942 -->|CHILDOF| cwe863\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe400 primary\n    class cwe770,cwe863 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a specially crafted request to the Observability API, which leads to **uncontrolled resource consumption** on the Kibana server, ultimately resulting in a server crash.\n  - Crafted Request -> **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400)** -> Server Crash\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the Kibana server crash. The vulnerability description clearly indicates that a specially crafted request leads to **uncontrolled resource consumption**, which is why CWE-400 was chosen as the primary CWE.\n\nThe retriever results suggested several other CWEs, including CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation), CWE-269 (Improper Privilege Management), and CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization). However, these CWEs do not directly address the root cause of the crash, which is the **uncontrolled resource consumption** itself.\n\nCWE-770 provides more details on the resource allocation without limits or throttling and, thus, is a better explanation of the vulnerability than CWE-400 alone. However, the description does not provide enough details to determine how resource allocation is happening and if a lack of throttling is the cause.\n\nCWE-863 was considered because the malicious user needs \"read permissions\" assigned to them. It's possible that the authorization logic is flawed, allowing the malicious user to send the crafted request. But since the description primarily points to **uncontrolled resource consumption** as the cause for the crash, and it is the most immediate cause, it is the best fit for the primary CWE.\n\nThe decision is primarily based on the provided evidence, specifically the vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary, which highlight the **uncontrolled resource consumption** as the direct cause of the server crash. The relationship analysis further supports this decision by identifying CWE-770 as a contributing factor in resource allocation issues, though the evidence is not strong enough to promote this to the primary CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nCWE-267 was not selected because the primary issue is resource consumption rather than unsafe actions due to privilege definition.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
