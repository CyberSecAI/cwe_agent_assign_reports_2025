## Vulnerability Description
OpenCTI is an open source platform allowing organizations to manage their cyber threat intelligence knowledge and observables. Prior to version 6.1.9, the regex validation used to prevent Introspection queries can be bypassed by removing the extra whitespace, carriage return, and line feed characters from the query. GraphQL Queries in OpenCTI can be validated using the `secureIntrospectionPlugin`. The regex check in the plkugin can be bypassed by removing the carriage return and line feed characters (`\r\n`). Running a curl command against a local instance of OpenCTI will result in a limited error message. By running the same Introspection query without the `\r\n` characters, the unauthenticated user is able to successfully run a full Introspection query. Bypassing this restriction allows the attacker to gather a wealth of information about the GraphQL endpoint functionality that can be used to perform actions and/or read data without authorization. These queries can also be weaponized to conduct a Denial of Service (DoS) attack if sent repeatedly. Users should upgrade to version 6.1.9 to receive a patch for the issue.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-37155:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of GraphQL queries within the OpenCTI platform. The `secureIntrospectionPlugin` was designed to prevent unauthorized introspection queries, but it relied on a simple string-based check using `includes()`. This check could be bypassed by removing whitespace, carriage returns, and line feeds from the query strings, allowing attackers to perform introspection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate Input Validation:** The primary weakness is the use of a simple string-based `includes()` check to detect introspection queries, which is easily circumvented.
*   **Bypass of Introspection Restriction:** The vulnerability allows attackers to bypass the intended restrictions on GraphQL schema introspection.
*   **Lack of Robust Parsing:** The validation did not properly parse and analyze the query structure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can gather detailed information about the GraphQL endpoint, including schema, types, fields, and operations. This information can be used to craft further attacks.
*   **Unauthorized Data Access/Manipulation:** The disclosed schema information can be used to perform actions and read data without proper authorization.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Introspection queries, when sent repeatedly, can be used to conduct a Denial of Service (DoS) attack, impacting the availability of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack can be carried out remotely over the network.
*   **Direct GraphQL Requests:** Exploitation occurs by sending crafted GraphQL queries to the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the OpenCTI GraphQL endpoint.
*   **GraphQL Knowledge:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of GraphQL to craft the necessary introspection queries.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability is exploitable without prior authentication (as mentioned in "Privileges required: None").

**Additional Notes**

*   The provided content also includes details about the fix, which involves a more robust check for introspection queries in commit `f87d969`.
*   The vulnerability is identified with CWE-284 (Improper Access Control).
*   The CVSS score is 6.5, indicating a "Moderate" severity.
*   The fix commit `f87d969`  changed the introspection check to use `['__schema', '__type'].some((pattern) => request.query.includes(pattern))` which is still a string includes check but less vulnerable to bypass.

In summary, the vulnerability arises from a weak regular expression check that is easily bypassed by manipulating whitespace.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control

**Authentication**:
Determines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.

* Example phrases: "user must log in", "lack of login check", "bypasses login"
* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.

  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* – used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).

**Authorization**:
Determines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do. It decides access *after* identity is verified.

* Example phrases: "unauthorized access", "regular user can access admin panel", "role checks are missing"
* CWE relevance: use CWEs like 862, 863, 285 for authorization errors:

  * **CWE-862**: *Missing Authorization* – the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all.
  * **CWE-863**: *Incorrect Authorization* – the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).
  * **CWE-285**: *Improper Authorization* – general category for any flawed authorization logic or design.

**Access Control**:
A broader term that includes both authentication and authorization. Governs how resources are protected and who can access them under what conditions.

* CWE relevance:

  * **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* – top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear.
  * This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.

## Mapping Discussion – Common Misclassification Patterns

### 1. **CWE-306 vs CWE-862**:

* **306** is about lack of **authentication** (e.g., *no login required at all*).
* **862** is about lack of **authorization** *after* authentication (e.g., *admin check missing*).
* ✅ Example CWE-306: *“An unauthenticated attacker can invoke the password reset API.”*
* ✅ Example CWE-862: *“An authenticated user without admin privileges can delete any user account.”*

### 2. **CWE-285 vs CWE-284**:

* **285** is specific to authorization flaws – it's a better choice than 284 **if** the issue involves *improper or missing role checks*.
* **284** should be reserved for general access control issues when it’s unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.

---

## Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification

**Phrase like "unauthorized access" is not enough.**

* If you **cannot determine whether identity was checked**, assume it’s **authorization** and consider 862 or 863.
* If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** → CWE-306.
* If the **access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced**, but it's not due to missing checks, consider **CWE-284**.

---

## Good Mapping Examples

* ✅ **CWE-306**: “The endpoint `/admin/deleteUser` does not require any authentication.”
* ✅ **CWE-862**: “Any logged-in user can change any other user's email without being an admin.”
* ✅ **CWE-863**: “An admin check exists but incorrectly grants access to non-admin users.”
* ✅ **CWE-285**: “Application uses a static role check that fails when roles change dynamically.”
* ✅ **CWE-284**: “Inconsistent enforcement of access rules across services with unclear policy source.”
