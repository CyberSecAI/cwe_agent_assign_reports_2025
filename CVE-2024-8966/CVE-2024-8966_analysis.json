  "description": "A vulnerability in the file upload process of gradio-app/gradio version @gradio/video@0.10.2 allows for a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. An attacker can append a large number of characters to the end of a multipart boundary, causing the system to continuously process each character and issue warnings. This can render Gradio inaccessible for extended periods, disrupting services and causing significant downtime.",

CWE-770 is a child of CWE-400, representing a more specific case of uncontrolled resource consumption. The vulnerability description points towards the **allocation of resources without limits or throttling** as the root cause, making CWE-770 the more appropriate choice. CWE-1284 is potentially part of the chain of weaknesses if the quantity of characters wasn't validated.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe1284[\"CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\"]\n\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    cwe1284 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe770\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe770 primary\n    class cwe400,cwe1284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the attacker appending a large number of characters to the multipart boundary. This leads to the system **allocating resources without limits or throttling** (CWE-770), resulting in **uncontrolled resource consumption** (CWE-400), and ultimately causing a Denial of Service (DoS). The **improper validation of the specified quantity in input** (CWE-1284) is a potential prerequisite to CWE-770, as the system should have validated the size of the multipart boundary to prevent excessive resource allocation.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the Denial of Service vulnerability. The description mentions the **allocation of resources without limits or throttling** due to a large number of characters being appended to the multipart boundary. This aligns well with CWE-770, which describes the allocation of resources without imposing restrictions on size or number. CWE-400 was considered but is too high-level. CWE-1284 could be a pre-cursor.\n\nThe graph relationships further support this decision, as CWE-770 is a child of CWE-400, providing a more specific classification. The evidence from the vulnerability description, combined with the hierarchical relationship, justifies selecting CWE-770 as the primary CWE. The level of specificity is optimal as it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability: **unlimited resource allocation**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.67\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-941: Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.65\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product creates a communication channel to initiate an outgoing request to an actor, but it does not correctly specify the intended destination for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.64\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates a reusable resource or group of resources on behalf of an actor without imposing any restrictions on the size or number of resources that can be allocated, in violation of the intended security policy for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**CWE-770 is the best fit here.**\n\n## CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.64\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource, thereby enabling an actor to influence the amount of resources consumed, eventually leading to the exhaustion of available resources.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-400 is intended for incorrect behaviors in which the product is expected to track and restrict how many resources it consumes, but CWE-400 is often misused because it is conflated with the \"technical impact\" of vulnerabilities in which resource consumption occurs.
