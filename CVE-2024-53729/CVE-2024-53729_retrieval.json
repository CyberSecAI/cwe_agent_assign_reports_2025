The specific impact can vary depending on the vulnerable actions within the plugin.\\n- **Attack vectors**: A malicious actor could craft a request that, when executed by an authenticated user, would perform actions on their behalf without their consent.\\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into executing a crafted request. This doesn't require direct access to the server or the application itself, but rather relies on exploiting a user's browser session. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.\", similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {}, 'top_cwes_by_threshold': {}}}, similarity_summary=SimilarityInsight(consensus_cwe='', top_cwes=[], confidence_levels={}, total_samples=0), analysis='', analysis_with_relationships='', criticism='', resolution='', relevant_cwes=[{'metadata': {'doc_id': '352', 'name': 'Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'rootcause:lack of CSRF protection', 'keyphrase': 'lack of CSRF protection', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'weakness:XSS', 'keyphrase': 'XSS', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'weakness:cross-site scripting', 'keyphrase': 'cross-site scripting', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'product:Plumeria Web Design Blizzard Quotes', 'keyphrase': 'Plumeria Web Design Blizzard Quotes', 'type': 'product'}, {'id': 'version:n/a through 1.3', 'keyphrase': 'n/a through 1.3', 'type': 'version'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(274.07634297755175)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '116', 'name': 'Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
