## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ALSA control Avoid WARN() for symlink errors Using WARN() for showing the error of symlink creations dont give more information than telling that something goes wrong, since the usual code path is a lregister callback from each control element creation. More badly, the use of WARN() rather confuses fuzzer as if it were serious issues. This patch downgrades the warning messages to use the normal dev_err() instead of WARN(). For making it clearer, add the function name to the prefix, too.
