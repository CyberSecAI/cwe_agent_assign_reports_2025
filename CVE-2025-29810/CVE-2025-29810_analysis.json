The vulnerability description is very generic. I considered all the other CWEs, but they are not as applicable as CWE-284, as the details of the vulnerability are lacking. The Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance section also suggests using CWE-284 when the access control failure exists but the root cause is unclear. The Privilege vs Permissions Guidance shows that if no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, then CWE-284 should be used. This is often overused, and should only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-284: Improper Access Control\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 2163.66\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe software does not restrict or incorrectly restricts access to resources (data, files, actions, etc.) to only the intended users.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This is a very high-level category.
