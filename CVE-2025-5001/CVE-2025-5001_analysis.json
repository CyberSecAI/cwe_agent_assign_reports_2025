  "description": "A vulnerability was found in GNU PSPP 82fb509fb2fedd33e7ac0c46ca99e108bb3bdffb. It has been declared as problematic. This vulnerability affects the function calloc of the file pspp-convert.c. The manipulation of the argument -l leads to **integer overflow**. Local access is required to approach this attack. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.",

  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-5001 Content\n\nBased on the provided content, here's the analysis related to a potential CVE-2025-5001:\n\n**1. Relevance Verification:**\n\nThe content from savannah.gnu.org details bug #67069 in the pspp project, specifically an \"Integer Overflow in pspp-convert leads to Crash\". This directly relates to a vulnerability that could be assigned a CVE, and the year 2025 is present in the bug report.\n\n**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**\n\n*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** An integer overflow in the `pspp-convert` utility when handling the `-l` option used for password brute-forcing encrypted syntax files.\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Integer overflow, leading to excessive memory allocation.\n*   **Impact of exploitation:** Crash of the `pspp-convert` utility.\n*   **Attack vectors:** Providing a large or negative number as input to the `-l` option of `pspp-convert`.\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  An attacker needs to be able to provide input to the `pspp-convert` utility. No special privileges are explicitly mentioned, suggesting a local or potentially remote attack vector if the utility is exposed.\n*   **Mitigation or fix:** Not explicitly stated in the provided content, but the bug report implies a fix is needed to properly validate the input to the `-l` option and prevent the integer overflow.\n\n**Additional Details (More Detail than Official CVE Description):**\n\n*   The bug report includes a proof of concept (POC) available at a Google Drive link: `https://drive.google.com/file/d/12IIt8eR591Z8O1ABOCkT_jdXSWaBxMZx/view?usp=drive_link`\n*   The report provides the specific commit hash where the vulnerability was found: `82fb509fb2fedd33e7ac0c46ca99e108bb3bdffb`\n*   The report details the environment where the vulnerability was reproduced: Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS, Clang-12.0.1.\n*   The AddressSanitizer output is included, pinpointing the `calloc` function as the source of the error due to the excessively large allocation size.\n*   The report credits Xudong Cao and Yuqing Zhang (UCAS, Zhongguancun Laboratory) with discovering the vulnerability.",
