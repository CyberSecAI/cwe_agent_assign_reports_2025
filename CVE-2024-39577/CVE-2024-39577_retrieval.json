This data can be exported to a CSV file, which allows users to read the data using spreadsheet software such as Excel, Numbers, or Calc. This software interprets entries beginning with '=' as formulas, which are then executed by the spreadsheet software. The software's formula language often allows methods to access hyperlinks or the local command line, and frequently allows enough characters to invoke an entire script. Attackers can populate data fields which, when saved to a CSV file, may attempt information exfiltration or other malicious activity when automatically executed by the spreadsheet software.\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2019-12134: Low privileged user can trigger CSV injection through a contact form field value\n\n- CVE-2019-4521: Cloud management product allows arbitrary command execution via CSV injection\n\n- CVE-2019-17661: CSV injection in content management system via formula code in a first or last name\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-41128: Hygeia is an application for collecting and processing personal and case data in connection with communicable diseases. In affected versions all CSV Exports (Statistics & BAG MED) contain a CSV Injection Vulnerability. Users of the system are able to submit formula as exported fields which then get executed upon ingestion of the exported file. There is no validation or sanitization of these formula fields and so malicious may construct malicious code. This vulnerability has been resolved in version 1.30.4. There are no workarounds and all users are advised to upgrade their package.\n\n- CVE-2021-38873: IBM Planning Analytics 2.0 is potentially vulnerable to CSV Injection. A remote attacker could execute arbitrary commands on the system, caused by improper validation of csv file contents. IBM X-Force ID: 208396.\n\n- CVE-2021-28829: The Administration GUI component of TIBCO Software Inc.'s TIBCO Administrator - Enterprise Edition, TIBCO Administrator - Enterprise Edition, TIBCO Administrator - Enterprise Edition Distribution for TIBCO Silver Fabric, TIBCO Administrator - Enterprise Edition Distribution for TIBCO Silver Fabric, TIBCO Administrator - Enterprise Edition for z/Linux, and TIBCO Administrator - Enterprise Edition for z/Linux contains an easily exploitable vulnerability that allows a low privileged attacker with network access to execute a persistent CSV injection attack from the affected system. A successful attack using this vulnerability requires human interaction from a person other than the attacker. Affected releases are TIBCO Software Inc.'s TIBCO Administrator - Enterprise Edition: versions 5.10.2 and below, TIBCO Administrator - Enterprise Edition: versions 5.11.0 and 5.11.1, TIBCO Administrator - Enterprise Edition Distribution for TIBCO Silver Fabric: versions 5.10.2 and below, TIBCO Administrator - Enterprise Edition Distribution for TIBCO Silver Fabric: versions 5.11.0 and 5.11.1, TIBCO Administrator - Enterprise Edition for z/Linux: versions 5.10.2 and below, and TIBCO Administrator - Enterprise Edition for z/Linux: versions 5.11.0 and 5.11.1.\n\n- CVE-2021-22035: VMware vRealize Log Insight (8.x prior to 8.6) contains a CSV(Comma Separated Value) injection vulnerability in interactive analytics export function. An authenticated malicious actor with non-administrative privileges may be able to embed untrusted data prior to exporting a CSV sheet through Log Insight which could be executed in user's environment.\n\n- CVE-2021-20509: IBM Maximo Asset Management 7.6.0 and 7.6.1 is potentially vulnerable to CSV Injection. A remote attacker could execute arbitrary commands on the system, caused by improper validation of csv file contents. IBM X-Force ID: 198243.\n\n- CVE-2021-41270: Symfony/Serializer handles serializing and deserializing data structures for Symfony, a PHP framework for web and console applications and a set of reusable PHP components. Symfony versions 4.1.0 before 4.4.35 and versions 5.0.0 before 5.3.12 are vulnerable to CSV injection, also known as formula injection. In Symfony 4.1, maintainers added the opt-in `csv_escape_formulas` option in the `CsvEncoder`, to prefix all cells starting with `=`, `+`, `-` or `@` with a tab `\\\\t`. Since then, OWASP added 2 chars in that list: Tab (0x09) and Carriage return (0x0D). This makes the previous prefix char (Tab `\\\\t`) part of the vulnerable characters, and OWASP suggests using the single quote `'` for prefixing the value. Starting with versions 4.4.34 and 5.3.12, Symfony now follows the OWASP recommendations and uses the single quote `'` to prefix formulas and add the prefix to cells starting by `\\\\t`, `\\\\r` as well as `=`, `+`, `-` and `@`.\n\n- CVE-2021-41390: In Ericsson ECM before 18.0, it was observed that Security Provider Endpoint in the User Profile Management Section is vulnerable to CSV Injection.\n\n- CVE-2021-24144: Unvalidated input in the Contact Form 7 Database Addon plugin, versions before 1.2.5.6, was prone to a vulnerability that lets remote attackers inject arbitrary formulas into CSV files.\n\n- CVE-2021-39022: IBM Guardium Data Encryption (GDE) 4.0.0.0 and 5.0.0.0 saves user-provided information into a Comma-Separated Value (CSV) file, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as a command when the file is opened by spreadsheet software. IBM X-Force ID: 213858.\n\n- CVE-2021-46363: An issue in the Export function of Magnolia v6.2.3 and below allows attackers to perform Formula Injection attacks via crafted CSV/XLS files. These formulas may result in arbitrary code execution on a victim's computer when opening the exported files with Microsoft Excel.\n\n- CVE-2022-27858: CSV Injection vulnerability in Activity Log Team Activity Log <= 2.8.3 on WordPress. \n\n- CVE-2022-1544: Formula Injection/CSV Injection due to Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in CSV File in GitHub repository luyadev/yii-helpers prior to 1.2.1. Successful exploitation can lead to impacts such as client-sided command injection, code execution, or remote ex-filtration of contained confidential data.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-74 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-74 (ChildOf)",

It is the lack of verification of these assumptions for user-controlled input that leads to injection problems. Injection problems encompass a wide variety of issues -- all mitigated in very different ways and usually attempted in order to alter the control flow of the process. For this reason, the most effective way to discuss these weaknesses is to note the distinct features that classify them as injection weaknesses. The most important issue to note is that all injection problems share one thing in common -- i.e., they allow for the injection of control plane data into the user-controlled data plane. This means that the execution of the process may be altered by sending code in through legitimate data channels, using no other mechanism. While buffer overflows, and many other flaws, involve the use of some further issue to gain execution, injection problems need only for the data to be parsed.\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2024-5184: API service using a large generative AI model allows direct prompt injection to leak hard-coded system prompts or execute other prompts.\n\n- CVE-2022-36069: Python-based dependency management tool avoids OS command injection when generating Git commands but allows injection of optional arguments with input beginning with a dash (CWE-88), potentially allowing for code execution.\n\n- CVE-1999-0067: Canonical example of OS command injection.

Note: Software versions which have reached End of Technical Support (EoTS) are not evaluated.\n\n- CVE-2022-35954: The GitHub Actions ToolKit provides a set of packages to make creating actions easier. The `core.exportVariable` function uses a well known delimiter that attackers can use to break out of that specific variable and assign values to other arbitrary variables. Workflows that write untrusted values to the `GITHUB_ENV` file may cause the path or other environment variables to be modified without the intention of the workflow or action author. Users should upgrade to `@actions/core v1.9.1`. If you are unable to upgrade the `@actions/core` package, you can modify your action to ensure that any user input does not contain the delimiter `_GitHubActionsFileCommandDelimeter_` before calling `core.exportVariable`.\n\n- CVE-2022-46265: A vulnerability has been identified in Polarion ALM (All versions < V2304.0).

A single bank account number can be extracted with <200 requests, a password hash can be extracted with ~1200 requests, all within a few minutes. The problem has been patched in commit d22916275c51500b4004933ff1b0a69bc807b2b7. In order to work around this issue, you can also cherry pick that patch, however it will not work without the Rails 5.0 migration that was done in #150, which in turn had quite a few pull requests it depended on.\n\n- CVE-2021-3958: Improper Handling of Parameters vulnerability in Ipack Automation Systems Ipack SCADA Software allows : Blind SQL Injection.This issue affects Ipack SCADA Software: from unspecified before 1.1.0. \n\n- CVE-2021-42760: A improper neutralization of special elements used in an sql command ('sql injection') in Fortinet FortiWLM version 8.6.1 and below allows attacker to disclose sensitive information from DB tables via crafted requests.\n\n- CVE-2021-43077: A improper neutralization of special elements used in an sql command ('sql injection') in Fortinet FortiWLM version 8.6.2 and below, version 8.5.2 and below, version 8.4.2 and below, version 8.3.2 and below allows attacker to execute unauthorized code or commands via crafted HTTP requests to the AP monitor handlers.\n\n- CVE-2021-43925: Improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL command ('SQL Injection') vulnerability in Log Management functionality in Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM) before 7.0.1-42218-2 allows remote attackers to inject SQL commands via unspecified vectors.\n\n- CVE-2021-43926: Improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL command ('SQL Injection') vulnerability in Log Management functionality in Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM) before 7.0.1-42218-2 allows remote attackers to inject SQL commands via unspecified vectors.\n\n- CVE-2021-43927: Improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL command ('SQL Injection') vulnerability in Security Management functionality in Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM) before 7.0.1-42218-2 allows remote attackers to inject SQL commands via unspecified vectors.\n\n- CVE-2022-0224: dolibarr is vulnerable to Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command\n\n- CVE-2022-0258: pimcore is vulnerable to Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command\n\n- CVE-2022-1358: The affected On-Premise is vulnerable to data exfiltration through improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL command.

These special elements can carry control implications. If product does not prevent external control or influence over the inclusion of such special elements, the control flow of the program may be altered from what was intended. For example, both Unix and Windows interpret the symbol < (\"less than\") as meaning \"read input from a file\".\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2001-0677: Read arbitrary files from mail client by providing a special MIME header that is internally used to store pathnames for attachments.\n\n- CVE-2000-0703: Setuid program does not cleanse special escape sequence before sending data to a mail program, causing the mail program to process those sequences.\n\n- CVE-2003-0020: Multi-channel issue. Terminal escape sequences not filtered from log files.\n\n- CVE-2003-0083: Multi-channel issue. Terminal escape sequences not filtered from log files.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-33592: NAVER Toolbar before 4.0.30.323 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted upgrade.xml file. Special characters in filename parameter can be the cause of bypassing code signing check function.\n\n- CVE-2022-0661: The Ad Injection WordPress plugin through 1.2.0.19 does not properly sanitize the body of the adverts injected into the pages, allowing a high privileged user (Admin+) to inject arbitrary HTML or javascript even with unfiltered_html disallowed, leading to a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Further it is also possible to inject PHP code, leading to a Remote Code execution (RCE) vulnerability, even if the DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT and DISALLOW_FILE_MOD constants are both set.\n\n- CVE-2022-35651: A stored XSS and blind SSRF vulnerability was found in Moodle, occurs due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied data in the SCORM track details. A remote attacker can trick the victim to follow a specially crafted link and execute arbitrary HTML and script code in user's browser in context of vulnerable website to steal potentially sensitive information, change appearance of the web page, can perform phishing and drive-by-download attacks.\n\n- CVE-2022-36325: Affected devices do not properly sanitize data introduced by an user when rendering the web interface. This could allow an authenticated remote attacker with administrative privileges to inject code and lead to a DOM-based XSS.\n\n- CVE-2022-4029: The Simple:Press plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the 'sforum_[md5 hash of the WordPress URL]' cookie value in versions up to, and including, 6.8 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link. This would be highly complex to exploit as it would require the attacker to set the cookie a cookie for the targeted user.\n\n- CVE-2022-24720: image_processing is an image processing wrapper for libvips and ImageMagick/GraphicsMagick. Prior to version 1.12.2, using the `#apply` method from image_processing to apply a series of operations that are coming from unsanitized user input allows the attacker to execute shell commands. This method is called internally by Active Storage variants, so Active Storage is vulnerable as well. The vulnerability has been fixed in version 1.12.2 of image_processing. As a workaround, users who process based on user input should always sanitize the user input by allowing only a constrained set of operations.\n\n- CVE-2021-25296: Nagios XI version xi-5.7.5 is affected by OS command injection. The vulnerability exists in the file /usr/local/nagiosxi/html/includes/configwizards/windowswmi/windowswmi.inc.php due to improper sanitization of authenticated user-controlled input by a single HTTP request, which can lead to OS command injection on the Nagios XI server.\n\n- CVE-2021-25297: Nagios XI version xi-5.7.5 is affected by OS command injection. The vulnerability exists in the file /usr/local/nagiosxi/html/includes/configwizards/switch/switch.inc.php due to improper sanitization of authenticated user-controlled input by a single HTTP request, which can lead to OS command injection on the Nagios XI server.\n\n- CVE-2021-25298: Nagios XI version xi-5.7.5 is affected by OS command injection. The vulnerability exists in the file /usr/local/nagiosxi/html/includes/configwizards/cloud-vm/cloud-vm.inc.php due to improper sanitization of authenticated user-controlled input by a single HTTP request, which can lead to OS command injection on the Nagios XI server.\n\n- CVE-2021-27101: Accellion FTA 9_12_370 and earlier is affected by SQL injection via a crafted Host header in a request to document_root.html. The fixed version is FTA_9_12_380 and later.\n\n- CVE-2021-35394: Realtek Jungle SDK version v2.x up to v3.4.14B provides a diagnostic tool called 'MP Daemon' that is usually compiled as 'UDPServer' binary. The binary is affected by multiple memory corruption vulnerabilities and an arbitrary command injection vulnerability that can be exploited by remote unauthenticated attackers.\n\n- CVE-2022-26352: An issue was discovered in the ContentResource API in dotCMS 3.0 through 22.02. Attackers can craft a multipart form request to post a file whose filename is not initially sanitized. This allows directory traversal, in which the file is saved outside of the intended storage location. If anonymous content creation is enabled, this allows an unauthenticated attacker to upload an executable file, such as a .jsp file, that can lead to remote code execution.\n\n- CVE-2022-27926: A reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the /public/launchNewWindow.jsp component of Zimbra Collaboration (aka ZCS) 9.0 allows unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary web script or HTML via request parameters.\n\n- CVE-2022-22221: An Improper Neutralization of Special Elements vulnerability in the download manager of Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series and EX Series allows a locally authenticated attacker with low privileges to take full control over the device. One aspect of this vulnerability is that the attacker needs to be able to execute any of the \"request ...\" or \"show system download ...\" commands. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series and EX Series: All versions prior to 19.2R1-S9, 19.2R3-S5; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R3-S6; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R3-S8; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R3-S4; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R3-S4; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R3-S3; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R3-S2, 20.4R3-S3; 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R3-S1; 21.2 versions prior to 21.2R2-S2, 21.2R3; 21.3 versions prior to 21.3R2, 21.3R3; 21.4 versions prior to 21.4R1-S1, 21.4R2.\n\n- CVE-2022-3047: Insufficient policy enforcement in Extensions API in Google Chrome prior to 105.0.5195.52 allowed an attacker who convinced a user to install a malicious extension to bypass downloads policy via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2022-21705: Octobercms is a self-hosted CMS platform based on the Laravel PHP Framework. In affected versions user input was not properly sanitized before rendering. An authenticated user with the permissions to create, modify and delete website pages can exploit this vulnerability to bypass `cms.safe_mode` / `cms.enableSafeMode` in order to execute arbitrary code. This issue only affects admin panels that rely on safe mode and restricted permissions. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must first have access to the backend area. The issue has been patched in Build 474 (v1.0.474) and v1.1.10. Users unable to upgrade should apply https://github.com/octobercms/library/commit/c393c5ce9ca2c5acc3ed6c9bb0dab5ffd61965fe to your installation manually.\n\n- CVE-2022-24039: A vulnerability has been identified in Desigo PXC4 (All versions < V02.20.142.10-10884), Desigo PXC5 (All versions < V02.20.142.10-10884). The \u201caddCell\u201d JavaScript function fails to properly sanitize user-controllable input before including it into the generated XML body of the XLS report document, such that it is possible to inject arbitrary content (e.g., XML tags) into the generated file. An attacker with restricted privileges, by poisoning any of the content used to generate XLS reports, could be able to leverage the application to deliver malicious files against higher-privileged users and obtain Remote Code Execution (RCE) against the administrator\u2019s workstation.\n\n- CVE-2022-35948: undici is an HTTP/1.1 client, written from scratch for Node.js.`=< undici@5.8.0` users are vulnerable to _CRLF Injection_ on headers when using unsanitized input as request headers, more specifically, inside the `content-type` header. Example: ``` import { request } from 'undici' const unsanitizedContentTypeInput = 'application/json\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nGET /foo2 HTTP/1.1' await request('http://localhost:3000, { method: 'GET', headers: { 'content-type': unsanitizedContentTypeInput }, }) ``` The above snippet will perform two requests in a single `request` API call: 1) `http://localhost:3000/` 2) `http://localhost:3000/foo2` This issue was patched in Undici v5.8.1. Sanitize input when sending content-type headers using user input as a workaround.\n\n- CVE-2021-24942: The Menu Item Visibility Control WordPress plugin through 0.5 doesn't sanitize and validate the \"Visibility logic\" option for WordPress menu items, which could allow highly privileged users to execute arbitrary PHP code even in a hardened environment.\n\n- CVE-2022-0819: Code Injection in GitHub repository dolibarr/dolibarr prior to 15.0.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-25644: All versions of package @pendo324/get-process-by-name are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code Execution due to improper sanitization of getProcessByName function.\n\n- CVE-2022-46161: pdfmake is an open source client/server side PDF printing in pure JavaScript.

Some CMS (Content Management Systems) also use templates.\n\n\nTemplate engines often have their own custom command or expression language. If an attacker can influence input into a template before it is processed, then the attacker can invoke arbitrary expressions, i.e. perform injection attacks. For example, in some template languages, an attacker could inject the expression \"{{7*7}}\" and determine if the output returns \"49\" instead. The syntax varies depending on the language.\n\n\nIn some cases, XSS-style attacks can work, which can obscure the root cause if the developer does not closely investigate the root cause of the error.\n\n\nTemplate engines can be used on the server or client, so both \"sides\" could be affected by injection. The mechanisms of attack or the affected technologies might be different, but the mistake is fundamentally the same.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2024-34359: Chain: Python bindings for LLM library do not use a sandboxed environment when parsing a template and constructing a prompt, allowing jinja2 Server Side Template Injection and code execution - one variant of a \"prompt injection\" attack.\n\n- CVE-2017-16783: server-side template injection in content management server\n\n- CVE-2020-9437: authentication / identity management product has client-side template injection\n\n- CVE-2020-12790: Server-Side Template Injection using a Twig template\n\n- CVE-2021-21244: devops platform allows SSTI\n\n- CVE-2020-4027: bypass of Server-Side Template Injection protection mechanism with macros in Velocity templates\n\n- CVE-2020-26282: web browser proxy server allows Java EL expressions from Server-Side Template Injection\n\n- CVE-2020-1961: SSTI involving mail templates and JEXL expressions\n\n- CVE-2019-19999: product does not use a \"safe\" setting for a FreeMarker configuration, allowing SSTI\n\n- CVE-2018-20465: product allows read of sensitive database username/password variables using server-side template injection\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-25283: An issue was discovered in through SaltStack Salt before 3002.5.

In versions before 3.0.0 vault-cli features the ability for rendering templated values. When a secret starts with the prefix `!template!`, vault-cli interprets the rest of the contents of the secret as a Jinja2 template. Jinja2 is a powerful templating engine and is not designed to safely render arbitrary templates. An attacker controlling a jinja2 template rendered on a machine can trigger arbitrary code, making this a Remote Code Execution (RCE) risk. If the content of the vault can be completely trusted, then this is not a problem. Otherwise, if your threat model includes cases where an attacker can manipulate a secret value read from the vault using vault-cli, then this vulnerability may impact you. In 3.0.0, the code related to interpreting vault templated secrets has been removed entirely. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. For users unable to upgrade a workaround does exist. Using the environment variable `VAULT_CLI_RENDER=false` or the flag `--no-render` (placed between `vault-cli` and the subcommand, e.g. `vault-cli --no-render get-all`) or adding `render: false` to the vault-cli configuration yaml file disables rendering and removes the vulnerability. Using the python library, you can use: `vault_cli.get_client(render=False)` when creating your client to get a client that will not render templated secrets and thus operates securely.\n\n- CVE-2021-46063: MCMS v5.2.5 was discovered to contain a Server Side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerability via the Template Management module.\n\n- CVE-2021-40219: Bolt CMS <= 4.2 is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution.

When software does not validate input properly, an attacker is able to craft the input in a form that is not expected by the rest of the application. This will lead to parts of the system receiving unintended input, which may result in altered control flow, arbitrary control of a resource, or arbitrary code execution.\n\n\nInput validation is not the only technique for processing input, however. Other techniques attempt to transform potentially-dangerous input into something safe, such as filtering (CWE-790) - which attempts to remove dangerous inputs - or encoding/escaping (CWE-116), which attempts to ensure that the input is not misinterpreted when it is included in output to another component. Other techniques exist as well (see CWE-138 for more examples.)\n\n\nInput validation can be applied to:\n\n\n  - raw data - strings, numbers, parameters, file contents, etc.\n\n  - metadata - information about the raw data, such as headers or size\n\nData can be simple or structured. Structured data can be composed of many nested layers, composed of combinations of metadata and raw data, with other simple or structured data.\n\nMany properties of raw data or metadata may need to be validated upon entry into the code, such as:\n\n\n  - specified quantities such as size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, etc.\n\n  - implied or derived quantities, such as the actual size of a file instead of a specified size\n\n  - indexes, offsets, or positions into more complex data structures\n\n  - symbolic keys or other elements into hash tables, associative arrays, etc.\n\n  - well-formedness, i.e. syntactic correctness - compliance with expected syntax \n\n  - lexical token correctness - compliance with rules for what is treated as a token\n\n  - specified or derived type - the actual type of the input (or what the input appears to be)\n\n  - consistency - between individual data elements, between raw data and metadata, between references, etc.\n\n  - conformance to domain-specific rules, e.g. business logic \n\n  - equivalence - ensuring that equivalent inputs are treated the same\n\n  - authenticity, ownership, or other attestations about the input, e.g. a cryptographic signature to prove the source of the data\n\nImplied or derived properties of data must often be calculated or inferred by the code itself. Errors in deriving properties may be considered a contributing factor to improper input validation. \n\nNote that \"input validation\" has very different meanings to different people, or within different classification schemes. Caution must be used when referencing this CWE entry or mapping to it. For example, some weaknesses might involve inadvertently giving control to an attacker over an input when they should not be able to provide an input at all, but sometimes this is referred to as input validation.\n\n\nFinally, it is important to emphasize that the distinctions between input validation and output escaping are often blurred, and developers must be careful to understand the difference, including how input validation is not always sufficient to prevent vulnerabilities, especially when less stringent data types must be supported, such as free-form text. Consider a SQL injection scenario in which a person's last name is inserted into a query. The name \"O'Reilly\" would likely pass the validation step since it is a common last name in the English language. However, this valid name cannot be directly inserted into the database because it contains the \"'\" apostrophe character, which would need to be escaped or otherwise transformed. In this case, removing the apostrophe might reduce the risk of SQL injection, but it would produce incorrect behavior because the wrong name would be recorded.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2024-37032: Large language model (LLM) management tool does not validate the format of a digest value (CWE-1287) from a private, untrusted model registry, enabling relative path traversal (CWE-23), a.k.a.

Continued receipt and processing of these packets will sustain the partial DoS. The overlayd daemon handles Overlay OAM packets, such as ping and traceroute, sent to the overlay. The service runs as root by default and listens for UDP connections on port 4789. This issue results from improper buffer size validation, which can lead to a buffer overflow. Unauthenticated attackers can send specially crafted packets to trigger this vulnerability, resulting in possible remote code execution. overlayd runs by default in MX Series, ACX Series, and QFX Series platforms. The SRX Series does not support VXLAN and is therefore not vulnerable to this issue. Other platforms are also vulnerable if a Virtual Extensible LAN (VXLAN) overlay network is configured.

The implementation of `tf.raw_ops.ReverseSequence` allows for stack overflow and/or `CHECK`-fail based denial of service. The implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/5b3b071975e01f0d250c928b2a8f901cd53b90a7/tensorflow/core/kernels/reverse_sequence_op.cc#L114-L118) fails to validate that `seq_dim` and `batch_dim` arguments are valid. Negative values for `seq_dim` can result in stack overflow or `CHECK`-failure, depending on the version of Eigen code used to implement the operation. Similar behavior can be exhibited by invalid values of `batch_dim`. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2021-29610: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.

The implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/eccb7ec454e6617738554a255d77f08e60ee0808/tensorflow/core/kernels/linalg/banded_triangular_solve_op.cc#L269-L278) calls `ValidateInputTensors` for input validation but fails to validate that the two tensors are not empty. Furthermore, since `OP_REQUIRES` macro only stops execution of current function after setting `ctx->status()` to a non-OK value, callers of helper functions that use `OP_REQUIRES` must check value of `ctx->status()` before continuing. This doesn't happen in this op's implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/eccb7ec454e6617738554a255d77f08e60ee0808/tensorflow/core/kernels/linalg/banded_triangular_solve_op.cc#L219), hence the validation that is present is also not effective.

To verify if you are affected, you can try to open the following URL: `http://localhost:3000/..%2F..%2FREADME#` (replace `http://localhost:3000` with your instance's base-URL e.g. `https://demo.hedgedoc.org/..%2F..%2FREADME#`). If you see a README page being rendered, you run an affected version. The attack works due the fact that the internal router passes the url-encoded alias to the `noteController.showNote`-function. This function passes the input directly to findNote() utility function, that will pass it on the the parseNoteId()-function, that tries to make sense out of the noteId/alias and check if a note already exists and if so, if a corresponding file on disk was updated. If no note exists the note creation-function is called, which pass this unvalidated alias, with a `.md` appended, into a path.join()-function which is read from the filesystem in the follow up routine and provides the pre-filled content of the new note. This allows an attacker to not only read arbitrary `.md` files from the filesystem, but also observes changes to them. The usefulness of this attack can be considered limited, since mainly markdown files are use the file-ending `.md` and all markdown files contained in the hedgedoc project, like the README, are public anyway. If other protections such as a chroot or container or proper file permissions are in place, this attack's usefulness is rather limited. On a reverse-proxy level one can force a URL-decode, which will prevent this attack because the router will not accept such a path.\n\n- CVE-2021-43555: mySCADA myDESIGNER Versions 8.20.0 and prior fails to properly validate contents of an imported project file, which may make the product vulnerable to a path traversal payload.

Helm is a tool for managing Charts. Charts are packages of pre-configured Kubernetes resources. In Helm from version 3.0 and before version 3.5.2, there a few cases where data loaded from potentially untrusted sources was not properly sanitized. When a SemVer in the `version` field of a chart is invalid, in some cases Helm allows the string to be used \"as is\" without sanitizing. Helm fails to properly sanitized some fields present on Helm repository `index.yaml` files. Helm does not properly sanitized some fields in the `plugin.yaml` file for plugins In some cases, Helm does not properly sanitize the fields in the `Chart.yaml` file. By exploiting these attack vectors, core maintainers were able to send deceptive information to a terminal screen running the `helm` command, as well as obscure or alter information on the screen. In some cases, we could send codes that terminals used to execute higher-order logic, like clearing a terminal screen. Further, during evaluation, the Helm maintainers discovered a few other fields that were not properly sanitized when read out of repository index files. This fix remedies all such cases, and once again enforces SemVer2 policies on version fields. All users of the Helm 3 should upgrade to the fixed version 3.5.2 or later. Those who use Helm as a library should verify that they either sanitize this data on their own, or use the proper Helm API calls to sanitize the data.\n\n- CVE-2021-22331: There is a JavaScript injection vulnerability in certain Huawei smartphones.

ZyXEL NAS devices achieve authentication by using the weblogin.cgi CGI executable. This program fails to properly sanitize the username parameter that is passed to it. If the username parameter contains certain characters, it can allow command injection with the privileges of the web server that runs on the ZyXEL device. Although the web server does not run as the root user, ZyXEL devices include a setuid utility that can be leveraged to run any command with root privileges. As such, it should be assumed that exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to remote code execution with root privileges. By sending a specially-crafted HTTP POST or GET request to a vulnerable ZyXEL device, a remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on the device. This may happen by directly connecting to a device if it is directly exposed to an attacker. However, there are ways to trigger such crafted requests even if an attacker does not have direct connectivity to a vulnerable devices. For example, simply visiting a website can result in the compromise of any ZyXEL device that is reachable from the client system.

Charts are packages of pre-configured Kubernetes resources. Fuzz testing, provided by the CNCF, identified input to functions in the _strvals_ package that can cause an out of memory panic. The _strvals_ package contains a parser that turns strings in to Go structures. The _strvals_ package converts these strings into structures Go can work with. Some string inputs can cause array data structures to be created causing an out of memory panic. Applications that use the _strvals_ package in the Helm SDK to parse user supplied input can suffer a Denial of Service when that input causes a panic that cannot be recovered from. The Helm Client will panic with input to `--set`, `--set-string`, and other value setting flags that causes an out of memory panic. Helm is not a long running service so the panic will not affect future uses of the Helm client. This issue has been resolved in 3.9.4.

It has been discovered that TYPO3 CMS is susceptible to host spoofing due to improper validation of the HTTP Host header. TYPO3 uses the HTTP Host header, for example, to generate absolute URLs during the frontend rendering process. Since the host header itself is provided by the client, it can be forged to any value, even in a name-based virtual hosts environment. This vulnerability is the same as described in TYPO3-CORE-SA-2014-001 (CVE-2014-3941). A regression, introduced during TYPO3 v11 development, led to this situation. The already existing setting $GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['SYS']['trustedHostsPattern'] (used as an effective mitigation strategy in previous TYPO3 versions) was not evaluated anymore, and reintroduced the vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2021-41138: Frontier is Substrate's Ethereum compatibility layer. In the newly introduced signed Frontier-specific extrinsic for `pallet-ethereum`, a large part of transaction validation logic was only called in transaction pool validation, but not in block execution. Malicious validators can take advantage of this to put invalid transactions into a block. The attack is limited in that the signature is always validated, and the majority of the validation is done again in the subsequent `pallet-evm` execution logic. However, do note that a chain ID replay attack was possible. In addition, spamming attacks are of main concerns, while they are limited by Substrate block size limits and other factors. The issue is patched in commit `146bb48849e5393004be5c88beefe76fdf009aba`.\n\n- CVE-2021-4120: snapd 2.54.2 fails to perform sufficient validation of snap content interface and layout paths, resulting in the ability for snaps to inject arbitrary AppArmor policy rules via malformed content interface and layout declarations and hence escape strict snap confinement.

By crafting a special `GET` request containing a valid form state, a form can be submitted without invoking any validators. Form state is secured with an HMAC that is still verified. That means that this issue can only be exploited if Form Finishers cause side effects even if no form values have been sent. Form Finishers can be adjusted in a way that they only execute an action if the submitted form contains some expected data. Alternatively a custom Finisher can be added as first finisher.

Open Forms supports file uploads as one of the form field types. These fields can be configured to allow only certain file extensions to be uploaded by end users (e.g. only PDF / Excel / ...). The input validation of uploaded files is insufficient in versions prior to 1.0.9 and 1.1.1. Users could alter or strip file extensions to bypass this validation. This results in files being uploaded to the server that are of a different file type than indicated by the file name extension. These files may be downloaded (manually or automatically) by staff and/or other applications for further processing. Malicious files can therefore find their way into internal/trusted networks. Versions 1.0.9 and 1.1.1 contain patches for this issue. As a workaround, an API gateway or intrusion detection solution in front of open-forms may be able to scan for and block malicious content before it reaches the Open Forms application.\n\n- CVE-2022-29206: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning.

By using special elements such as \"..\" and \"/\" separators, attackers can escape outside of the restricted location to access files or directories that are elsewhere on the system. One of the most common special elements is the \"../\" sequence, which in most modern operating systems is interpreted as the parent directory of the current location. This is referred to as relative path traversal. Path traversal also covers the use of absolute pathnames such as \"/usr/local/bin\" to access unexpected files. This is referred to as absolute path traversal.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2024-37032: Large language model (LLM) management tool does not validate the format of a digest value (CWE-1287) from a private, untrusted model registry, enabling relative path traversal (CWE-23), a.k.a.

A path traversal vulnerability exists in versions prior to 15.3.18, 15.5.3, and 16.0.0. Using a specially prepared ZIP file, it is possible to overwrite any file that is writable by the application server user (e.g. the tomcat user). Depending on the configuration this can be limited to files of the OpenOlat user data directory, however, if not properly set up, the attack could also be used to overwrite application server config files, java code or even operating system files. The attack could be used to corrupt or modify any OpenOlat file such as course structures, config files or temporary test data. Those attack would require in-depth knowledge of the installation and thus more theoretical. If the app server configuration allows the execution of jsp files and the path to the context is known, it is also possible to execute java code. If the app server runs with the same user that is used to deploy the OpenOlat code or has write permissions on the OpenOlat code files and the path to the context is know, code injection is possible. The attack requires an OpenOlat user account to upload a ZIP file and trigger the unzip method. It can not be exploited by unregistered users. The problem is fixed in versions 15.3.18, 15.5.3 and 16.0.0. There are no known workarounds aside from upgrading.\n\n- CVE-2020-19146: Improper Access Control in Jfinal CMS v4.7.1 and earlier allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via the 'TemplatePath' parameter in the component 'jfinal_cms/admin/folder/list'.\n\n- CVE-2020-19147: Improper Access Control in Jfinal CMS v4.7.1 and earlier allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive infromation via the 'getFolder()' function in the component '/modules/filemanager/FileManager.java'.\n\n- CVE-2020-26806: admin/file.do in ObjectPlanet Opinio before 7.15 allows Unrestricted File Upload of executable JSP files, resulting in remote code execution, because filePath can have directory traversal and fileContent can be valid JSP code.\n\n- CVE-2021-20034: An improper access control vulnerability in SMA100 allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to bypass the path traversal checks and delete an arbitrary file potentially resulting in a reboot to factory default settings.\n\n- CVE-2021-23428: This affects all versions of package elFinder.NetCore.

The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input validation of URLs in HTTP requests processed by an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request containing directory traversal character sequences to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view arbitrary files within the web services file system on the targeted device. The web services file system is enabled when the affected device is configured with either WebVPN or AnyConnect features. This vulnerability cannot be used to obtain access to ASA or FTD system files or underlying operating system (OS) files.\n\n- CVE-2020-11652: An issue was discovered in SaltStack Salt before 2019.2.4 and 3000 before 3000.2. The salt-master process ClearFuncs class allows access to some methods that improperly sanitize paths. These methods allow arbitrary directory access to authenticated users.\n\n- CVE-2020-1631: A vulnerability in the HTTP/HTTPS service used by J-Web, Web Authentication, Dynamic-VPN (DVPN), Firewall Authentication Pass-Through with Web-Redirect, and Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP) allows an unauthenticated attacker to perform local file inclusion (LFI) or path traversal. Using this vulnerability, an attacker may be able to inject commands into the httpd.log, read files with 'world' readable permission file or obtain J-Web session tokens. In the case of command injection, as the HTTP service runs as user 'nobody', the impact of this command injection is limited. (CVSS score 5.3, vector CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N) In the case of reading files with 'world' readable permission, in Junos OS 19.3R1 and above, the unauthenticated attacker would be able to read the configuration file. (CVSS score 5.9, vector CVSS:3.1/ AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N) If J-Web is enabled, the attacker could gain the same level of access of anyone actively logged into J-Web. If an administrator is logged in, the attacker could gain administrator access to J-Web. (CVSS score 8.8, vector CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) This issue only affects Juniper Networks Junos OS devices with HTTP/HTTPS services enabled. Junos OS devices with HTTP/HTTPS services disabled are not affected. If HTTP/HTTPS services are enabled, the following command will show the httpd processes: user@device> show system processes | match http 5260 - S 0:00.13 /usr/sbin/httpd-gk -N 5797 - I 0:00.10 /usr/sbin/httpd --config /jail/var/etc/httpd.conf To summarize: If HTTP/HTTPS services are disabled, there is no impact from this vulnerability. If HTTP/HTTPS services are enabled and J-Web is not in use, this vulnerability has a CVSS score of 5.9 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N). If J-Web is enabled, this vulnerability has a CVSS score of 8.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H). Juniper SIRT has received a single report of this vulnerability being exploited in the wild. Out of an abundance of caution, we are notifying customers so they can take appropriate actions. Indicators of Compromise: The /var/log/httpd.log may have indicators that commands have injected or files being accessed. The device administrator can look for these indicators by searching for the string patterns \"=*;*&\" or \"*%3b*&\" in /var/log/httpd.log, using the following command: user@device> show log httpd.log | match \"=*;*&|=*%3b*&\" If this command returns any output, it might be an indication of malicious attempts or simply scanning activities. Rotated logs should also be reviewed, using the following command: user@device> show log httpd.log.0.gz | match \"=*;*&|=*%3b*&\" user@device> show log httpd.log.1.gz | match \"=*;*&|=*%3b*&\" Note that a skilled attacker would likely remove these entries from the local log file, thus effectively eliminating any reliable signature that the device had been attacked. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS 12.3 versions prior to 12.3R12-S16; 12.3X48 versions prior to 12.3X48-D101, 12.3X48-D105; 14.1X53 versions prior to 14.1X53-D54; 15.1 versions prior to 15.1R7-S7; 15.1X49 versions prior to 15.1X49-D211, 15.1X49-D220; 16.1 versions prior to 16.1R7-S8; 17.2 versions prior to 17.2R3-S4; 17.3 versions prior to 17.3R3-S8; 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R2-S11, 17.4R3-S2; 18.1 versions prior to 18.1R3-S10; 18.2 versions prior to 18.2R2-S7, 18.2R3-S4; 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R2-S4, 18.3R3-S2; 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R1-S7, 18.4R3-S2 ; 18.4 version 18.4R2 and later versions; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R1-S5, 19.1R3-S1; 19.1 version 19.1R2 and later versions; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R2; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R2-S3, 19.3R3; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R1-S2, 19.4R2; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R1-S1, 20.1R2.\n\n- CVE-2020-4430: IBM Data Risk Manager 2.0.1, 2.0.2, 2.0.3, and 2.0.4 could allow a remote authenticated attacker to traverse directories on the system.

Argo CD starting with version 1.3.0 but before versions 2.1.11, 2.2.6, and 2.3.0 is vulnerable to a path traversal bug, compounded by an improper access control bug, allowing a malicious user with read-only repository access to leak sensitive files from Argo CD's repo-server. A malicious Argo CD user who has been granted `get` access for a repository containing a Helm chart can craft an API request to the `/api/v1/repositories/{repo_url}/appdetails` endpoint to leak the contents of out-of-bounds files from the repo-server. The malicious payload would reference an out-of-bounds file, and the contents of that file would be returned as part of the response. Contents from a non-YAML file may be returned as part of an error message. The attacker would have to know or guess the location of the target file. Sensitive files which could be leaked include files from other Applications' source repositories or any secrets which have been mounted as files on the repo-server. This vulnerability is patched in Argo CD versions 2.1.11, 2.2.6, and 2.3.0. The patches prevent path traversal and limit access to users who either A) have been granted Application `create` privileges or B) have been granted Application `get` privileges and are requesting details for a `repo_url` that has already been used for the given Application. There are currently no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-27925: Zimbra Collaboration (aka ZCS) 8.8.15 and 9.0 has mboximport functionality that receives a ZIP archive and extracts files from it.

Such an alteration could lead to arbitrary code execution.\n\n\nInjection problems encompass a wide variety of issues -- all mitigated in very different ways. For this reason, the most effective way to discuss these weaknesses is to note the distinct features which classify them as injection weaknesses. The most important issue to note is that all injection problems share one thing in common -- i.e., they allow for the injection of control plane data into the user-controlled data plane. This means that the execution of the process may be altered by sending code in through legitimate data channels, using no other mechanism. While buffer overflows, and many other flaws, involve the use of some further issue to gain execution, injection problems need only for the data to be parsed. The most classic instantiations of this category of weakness are SQL injection and format string vulnerabilities.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2023-29374: Math component in an LLM framework translates user input into a Python expression that is input into the Python exec() method, allowing code execution - one variant of a \"prompt injection\" attack.\n\n- CVE-2024-5565: Python-based library uses an LLM prompt containing user input to dynamically generate code that is then fed as input into the Python exec() method, allowing code execution - one variant of a \"prompt injection\" attack.\n\n- CVE-2024-4181: Framework for LLM applications allows eval injection via a crafted response from a hosting provider.\n\n- CVE-2022-2054: Python compiler uses eval() to execute malicious strings as Python code.\n\n- CVE-2021-22204: Chain: regex in EXIF processor code does not correctly determine where a string ends (CWE-625), enabling eval injection (CWE-95), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2020-8218: \"Code injection\" in VPN product, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2008-5071: Eval injection in PHP program.\n\n- CVE-2002-1750: Eval injection in Perl program.\n\n- CVE-2008-5305: Eval injection in Perl program using an ID that should only contain hyphens and numbers.\n\n- CVE-2002-1752: Direct code injection into Perl eval function.\n\n- CVE-2002-1753: Eval injection in Perl program.\n\n- CVE-2005-1527: Direct code injection into Perl eval function.\n\n- CVE-2005-2837: Direct code injection into Perl eval function.\n\n- CVE-2005-1921: MFV. code injection into PHP eval statement using nested constructs that should not be nested.\n\n- CVE-2005-2498: MFV. code injection into PHP eval statement using nested constructs that should not be nested.\n\n- CVE-2005-3302: Code injection into Python eval statement from a field in a formatted file.\n\n- CVE-2007-1253: Eval injection in Python program.\n\n- CVE-2001-1471: chain: Resultant eval injection.

It does so by using dynamically generated Groovy classes. A user able to control job parameters can run arbitrary code on OneDev's server by injecting arbitrary Groovy code. The ultimate result is in the injection of a static constructor that will run arbitrary code. For a full example refer to the referenced GHSA. This issue was addressed in 4.0.3 by escaping special characters such as quote from user input.\n\n- CVE-2021-21277: angular-expressions is \"angular's nicest part extracted as a standalone module for the browser and node\". In angular-expressions before version 1.1.2 there is a vulnerability which allows Remote Code Execution if you call \"expressions.compile(userControlledInput)\" where \"userControlledInput\" is text that comes from user input. The security of the package could be bypassed by using a more complex payload, using a \".constructor.constructor\" technique. In terms of impact: If running angular-expressions in the browser, an attacker could run any browser script when the application code calls expressions.compile(userControlledInput). If running angular-expressions on the server, an attacker could run any Javascript expression, thus gaining Remote Code Execution.

In version 3.6.0, if a user received a malicious file share and has it synced locally or the virtual filesystem enabled and clicked a nc://open/ link it will open the default editor for the file type of the shared file, which on Windows can also sometimes mean that a file depending on the type, e.g. \"vbs\", is being executed. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Desktop client is upgraded to version 3.6.1. As a workaround, users can block the Nextcloud Desktop client 3.6.0 by setting the `minimum.supported.desktop.version` system config to `3.6.1` on the server, so new files designed to use this attack vector are not downloaded anymore. Already existing files can still be used. Another workaround would be to enforce shares to be accepted by setting the `sharing.force_share_accept` system config to `true` on the server, so new files designed to use this attack vector are not downloaded anymore. Already existing shares can still be abused.\n\n- CVE-2022-38078: Movable Type XMLRPC API provided by Six Apart Ltd. contains a command injection vulnerability. Sending a specially crafted message by POST method to Movable Type XMLRPC API may allow arbitrary Perl script execution, and an arbitrary OS command may be executed through it.

The specific exploit requires the application to run on Tomcat as a WAR deployment. If the application is deployed as a Spring Boot executable jar, i.e. the default, it is not vulnerable to the exploit. However, the nature of the vulnerability is more general, and there may be other ways to exploit it.\n\n- CVE-2022-29171: Sourcegraph is a fast and featureful code search and navigation engine. Versions before 3.38.0 are vulnerable to Remote Code Execution in the gitserver service. The Gitolite code host integration with Phabricator allows Sourcegraph site admins to specify a `callsignCommand`, which is used to obtain the Phabricator metadata for a Gitolite repository. An administrator who is able to edit or add a Gitolite code host and has administrative access to Sourcegraph\u2019s bundled Grafana instance can change this command arbitrarily and run it remotely. This grants direct access to the infrastructure underlying the Sourcegraph installation. The attack requires: site-admin privileges on the instance of Sourcegraph, Administrative privileges on the bundled Grafana monitoring instance, Knowledge of the gitserver IP address or DNS name (if running in Kubernetes). This can be found through Grafana. The issue is patched in version 3.38.0. You may disable Gitolite code hosts. We still highly encourage upgrading regardless of workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2021-27446: The Weintek cMT product line is vulnerable to code injection, which may allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute commands with root privileges on the operation system.\n\n- CVE-2021-39908: In all versions of GitLab CE/EE starting from 0.8.0 before 14.2.6, all versions starting from 14.3 before 14.3.4, and all versions starting from 14.4 before 14.4.1 certain Unicode characters can be abused to commit malicious code into projects without being noticed in merge request or source code viewer UI.\n\n- CVE-2022-1159: Rockwell Automation Studio 5000 Logix Designer (all versions) are vulnerable when an attacker who achieves administrator access on a workstation running Studio 5000 Logix Designer could inject controller code undetectable to a user.\n\n- CVE-2022-21831: A code injection vulnerability exists in the Active Storage >= v5.2.0 that could allow an attacker to execute code via image_processing arguments.\n\n- CVE-2022-22285: A vulnerability using PendingIntent in Reminder prior to version 12.2.05.0 in Android R(11.0) and 12.3.02.1000 in Android S(12.0) allows attackers to execute privileged action by hijacking and modifying the intent.\n\n- CVE-2022-22286: A vulnerability using PendingIntent in Bixby Routines prior to version 3.1.21.8 in Android R(11.0) and 2.6.30.5 in Android Q(10.0) allows attackers to execute privileged action by hijacking and modifying the intent.\n\n- CVE-2022-23120: A code injection vulnerability in Trend Micro Deep Security and Cloud One - Workload Security Agent for Linux version 20 and below could allow an attacker to escalate privileges and run arbitrary code in the context of root. Please note: an attacker must first obtain access to the target agent in an un-activated and unconfigured state in order to exploit this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2022-23503: TYPO3 is an open source PHP based web content management system. Versions prior to 8.7.49, 9.5.38, 10.4.33, 11.5.20, and 12.1.1 are vulnerable to Code Injection. Due to the lack of separating user-submitted data from the internal configuration in the Form Designer backend module, it is possible to inject code instructions to be processed and executed via TypoScript as PHP code. The existence of individual TypoScript instructions for a particular form item and a valid backend user account with access to the form module are needed to exploit this vulnerability. This issue is patched in versions 8.7.49 ELTS, 9.5.38 ELTS, 10.4.33, 11.5.20, 12.1.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-24663: PHP Everywhere <= 2.0.3 included functionality that allowed execution of PHP Code Snippets via WordPress shortcodes, which can be used by any authenticated user.\n\n- CVE-2022-24735: Redis is an in-memory database that persists on disk. By exploiting weaknesses in the Lua script execution environment, an attacker with access to Redis prior to version 7.0.0 or 6.2.7 can inject Lua code that will execute with the (potentially higher) privileges of another Redis user. The Lua script execution environment in Redis provides some measures that prevent a script from creating side effects that persist and can affect the execution of the same, or different script, at a later time. Several weaknesses of these measures have been publicly known for a long time, but they had no security impact as the Redis security model did not endorse the concept of users or privileges. With the introduction of ACLs in Redis 6.0, these weaknesses can be exploited by a less privileged users to inject Lua code that will execute at a later time, when a privileged user executes a Lua script. The problem is fixed in Redis versions 7.0.0 and 6.2.7. An additional workaround to mitigate this problem without patching the redis-server executable, if Lua scripting is not being used, is to block access to `SCRIPT LOAD` and `EVAL` commands using ACL rules.\n\n- CVE-2022-24817: Flux2 is an open and extensible continuous delivery solution for Kubernetes. Flux2 versions between 0.1.0 and 0.29.0, helm-controller 0.1.0 to v0.19.0, and kustomize-controller 0.1.0 to v0.23.0 are vulnerable to Code Injection via malicious Kubeconfig. In multi-tenancy deployments this can also lead to privilege escalation if the controller's service account has elevated permissions. Workarounds include disabling functionality via Validating Admission webhooks by restricting users from setting the `spec.kubeConfig` field in Flux `Kustomization` and `HelmRelease` objects. Additional mitigations include applying restrictive AppArmor and SELinux profiles on the controller\u2019s pod to limit what binaries can be executed. This vulnerability is fixed in kustomize-controller v0.23.0 and helm-controller v0.19.0, both included in flux2 v0.29.0\n\n- CVE-2022-29813: In JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA before 2022.1 local code execution via custom Pandoc path was possible\n\n- CVE-2022-29814: In JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA before 2022.1 local code execution via HTML descriptions in custom JSON schemas was possible\n\n- CVE-2022-29815: In JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA before 2022.1 local code execution via workspace settings was possible\n\n- CVE-2022-29819: In JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA before 2022.1 local code execution via links in Quick Documentation was possible\n\n- CVE-2022-29821: In JetBrains Rider before 2022.1 local code execution via links in ReSharper Quick Documentation was possible\n\n- CVE-2022-30083: EllieGrid Android Application version 3.4.1 is vulnerable to Code Injection.

Other pre-existing weaknesses can turn into security vulnerabilities if they occur while operating at raised privileges.\n\n\nPrivilege management functions can behave in some less-than-obvious ways, and they have different quirks on different platforms. These inconsistencies are particularly pronounced if you are transitioning from one non-root user to another. Signal handlers and spawned processes run at the privilege of the owning process, so if a process is running as root when a signal fires or a sub-process is executed, the signal handler or sub-process will operate with root privileges.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2007-4217: FTP client program on a certain OS runs with setuid privileges and has a buffer overflow. Most clients do not need extra privileges, so an overflow is not a vulnerability for those clients.\n\n- CVE-2008-1877: Program runs with privileges and calls another program with the same privileges, which allows read of arbitrary files.\n\n- CVE-2007-5159: OS incorrectly installs a program with setuid privileges, allowing users to gain privileges.\n\n- CVE-2008-4638: Composite: application running with high privileges (CWE-250) allows user to specify a restricted file to process, which generates a parsing error that leaks the contents of the file (CWE-209).\n\n- CVE-2008-0162: Program does not drop privileges before calling another program, allowing code execution.\n\n- CVE-2008-0368: setuid root program allows creation of arbitrary files through command line argument.\n\n- CVE-2007-3931: Installation script installs some programs as setuid when they shouldn't be.\n\n- CVE-2020-3812: mail program runs as root but does not drop its privileges before attempting to access a file. Attacker can use a symlink from their home directory to a directory only readable by root, then determine whether the file exists based on the response.\n\n- CVE-2003-0908: Product launches Help functionality while running with raised privileges, allowing command execution using Windows message to access \"open file\" dialog.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-8793: OpenSMTPD before 6.6.4 allows local users to read arbitrary files (e.g., on some Linux distributions) because of a combination of an untrusted search path in makemap.c and race conditions in the offline functionality in smtpd.c.\n\n- CVE-2021-1675: Windows Print Spooler Remote Code Execution Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-0204: A sensitive information disclosure vulnerability in delta-export configuration utility (dexp) of Juniper Networks Junos OS may allow a locally authenticated shell user the ability to create and read database files generated by the dexp utility, including password hashes of local users.

When software does not validate input properly, an attacker is able to craft the input in a form that is not expected by the rest of the application. This will lead to parts of the system receiving unintended input, which may result in altered control flow, arbitrary control of a resource, or arbitrary code execution.\n\n\nInput validation is not the only technique for processing input, however. Other techniques attempt to transform potentially-dangerous input into something safe, such as filtering (CWE-790) - which attempts to remove dangerous inputs - or encoding/escaping (CWE-116), which attempts to ensure that the input is not misinterpreted when it is included in output to another component. Other techniques exist as well (see CWE-138 for more examples.)\n\n\nInput validation can be applied to:\n\n\n  - raw data - strings, numbers, parameters, file contents, etc.\n\n  - metadata - information about the raw data, such as headers or size\n\nData can be simple or structured. Structured data can be composed of many nested layers, composed of combinations of metadata and raw data, with other simple or structured data.\n\nMany properties of raw data or metadata may need to be validated upon entry into the code, such as:\n\n\n  - specified quantities such as size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, etc.\n\n  - implied or derived quantities, such as the actual size of a file instead of a specified size\n\n  - indexes, offsets, or positions into more complex data structures\n\n  - symbolic keys or other elements into hash tables, associative arrays, etc.\n\n  - well-formedness, i.e. syntactic correctness - compliance with expected syntax \n\n  - lexical token correctness - compliance with rules for what is treated as a token\n\n  - specified or derived type - the actual type of the input (or what the input appears to be)\n\n  - consistency - between individual data elements, between raw data and metadata, between references, etc.\n\n  - conformance to domain-specific rules, e.g. business logic \n\n  - equivalence - ensuring that equivalent inputs are treated the same\n\n  - authenticity, ownership, or other attestations about the input, e.g. a cryptographic signature to prove the source of the data\n\nImplied or derived properties of data must often be calculated or inferred by the code itself. Errors in deriving properties may be considered a contributing factor to improper input validation. \n\nNote that \"input validation\" has very different meanings to different people, or within different classification schemes. Caution must be used when referencing this CWE entry or mapping to it. For example, some weaknesses might involve inadvertently giving control to an attacker over an input when they should not be able to provide an input at all, but sometimes this is referred to as input validation.\n\n\nFinally, it is important to emphasize that the distinctions between input validation and output escaping are often blurred, and developers must be careful to understand the difference, including how input validation is not always sufficient to prevent vulnerabilities, especially when less stringent data types must be supported, such as free-form text. Consider a SQL injection scenario in which a person's last name is inserted into a query. The name \"O'Reilly\" would likely pass the validation step since it is a common last name in the English language. However, this valid name cannot be directly inserted into the database because it contains the \"'\" apostrophe character, which would need to be escaped or otherwise transformed. In this case, removing the apostrophe might reduce the risk of SQL injection, but it would produce incorrect behavior because the wrong name would be recorded.\n",

It is the lack of verification of these assumptions for user-controlled input that leads to injection problems. Injection problems encompass a wide variety of issues -- all mitigated in very different ways and usually attempted in order to alter the control flow of the process. For this reason, the most effective way to discuss these weaknesses is to note the distinct features that classify them as injection weaknesses. The most important issue to note is that all injection problems share one thing in common -- i.e., they allow for the injection of control plane data into the user-controlled data plane. This means that the execution of the process may be altered by sending code in through legitimate data channels, using no other mechanism. While buffer overflows, and many other flaws, involve the use of some further issue to gain execution, injection problems need only for the data to be parsed.",

            "extended_description": "\n\nThis weakness can lead to a vulnerability in environments in which the attacker does not have direct access to the operating system, such as in web applications. Alternately, if the weakness occurs in a privileged program, it could allow the attacker to specify commands that normally would not be accessible, or to call alternate commands with privileges that the attacker does not have. The problem is exacerbated if the compromised process does not follow the principle of least privilege, because the attacker-controlled commands may run with special system privileges that increases the amount of damage.\n\n\nThere are at least two subtypes of OS command injection:\n\n\n  - The application intends to execute a single, fixed program that is under its own control. It intends to use externally-supplied inputs as arguments to that program. For example, the program might use system(\"nslookup [HOSTNAME]\") to run nslookup and allow the user to supply a HOSTNAME, which is used as an argument. Attackers cannot prevent nslookup from executing. However, if the program does not remove command separators from the HOSTNAME argument, attackers could place the separators into the arguments, which allows them to execute their own program after nslookup has finished executing.\n\n  - The application accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run, as well as which commands to use. The application simply redirects this entire command to the operating system. For example, the program might use \"exec([COMMAND])\" to execute the [COMMAND] that was supplied by the user. If the COMMAND is under attacker control, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or programs. If the command is being executed using functions like exec() and CreateProcess(), the attacker might not be able to combine multiple commands together in the same line.\n\nFrom a weakness standpoint, these variants represent distinct programmer errors. In the first variant, the programmer clearly intends that input from untrusted parties will be part of the arguments in the command to be executed. In the second variant, the programmer does not intend for the command to be accessible to any untrusted party, but the programmer probably has not accounted for alternate ways in which malicious attackers can provide input.",

              "extended_description": "\n\nInput validation is a frequently-used technique for checking potentially dangerous inputs in order to ensure that the inputs are safe for processing within the code, or when communicating with other components. When software does not validate input properly, an attacker is able to craft the input in a form that is not expected by the rest of the application. This will lead to parts of the system receiving unintended input, which may result in altered control flow, arbitrary control of a resource, or arbitrary code execution.\n\n\nInput validation is not the only technique for processing input, however. Other techniques attempt to transform potentially-dangerous input into something safe, such as filtering (CWE-790) - which attempts to remove dangerous inputs - or encoding/escaping (CWE-116), which attempts to ensure that the input is not misinterpreted when it is included in output to another component. Other techniques exist as well (see CWE-138 for more examples.)\n\n\nInput validation can be applied to:\n\n\n  - raw data - strings, numbers, parameters, file contents, etc.\n\n  - metadata - information about the raw data, such as headers or size\n\nData can be simple or structured. Structured data can be composed of many nested layers, composed of combinations of metadata and raw data, with other simple or structured data.\n\nMany properties of raw data or metadata may need to be validated upon entry into the code, such as:\n\n\n  - specified quantities such as size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, etc.\n\n  - implied or derived quantities, such as the actual size of a file instead of a specified size\n\n  - indexes, offsets, or positions into more complex data structures\n\n  - symbolic keys or other elements into hash tables, associative arrays, etc.\n\n  - well-formedness, i.e. syntactic correctness - compliance with expected syntax \n\n  - lexical token correctness - compliance with rules for what is treated as a token\n\n  - specified or derived type - the actual type of the input (or what the input appears to be)\n\n  - consistency - between individual data elements, between raw data and metadata, between references, etc.\n\n  - conformance to domain-specific rules, e.g. business logic \n\n  - equivalence - ensuring that equivalent inputs are treated the same\n\n  - authenticity, ownership, or other attestations about the input, e.g. a cryptographic signature to prove the source of the data\n\nImplied or derived properties of data must often be calculated or inferred by the code itself. Errors in deriving properties may be considered a contributing factor to improper input validation. \n\nNote that \"input validation\" has very different meanings to different people, or within different classification schemes. Caution must be used when referencing this CWE entry or mapping to it. For example, some weaknesses might involve inadvertently giving control to an attacker over an input when they should not be able to provide an input at all, but sometimes this is referred to as input validation.\n\n\nFinally, it is important to emphasize that the distinctions between input validation and output escaping are often blurred, and developers must be careful to understand the difference, including how input validation is not always sufficient to prevent vulnerabilities, especially when less stringent data types must be supported, such as free-form text. Consider a SQL injection scenario in which a person's last name is inserted into a query. The name \"O'Reilly\" would likely pass the validation step since it is a common last name in the English language. However, this valid name cannot be directly inserted into the database because it contains the \"'\" apostrophe character, which would need to be escaped or otherwise transformed. In this case, removing the apostrophe might reduce the risk of SQL injection, but it would produce incorrect behavior because the wrong name would be recorded.\n",

It is the lack of verification of these assumptions for user-controlled input that leads to injection problems. Injection problems encompass a wide variety of issues -- all mitigated in very different ways and usually attempted in order to alter the control flow of the process. For this reason, the most effective way to discuss these weaknesses is to note the distinct features that classify them as injection weaknesses. The most important issue to note is that all injection problems share one thing in common -- i.e., they allow for the injection of control plane data into the user-controlled data plane. This means that the execution of the process may be altered by sending code in through legitimate data channels, using no other mechanism. While buffer overflows, and many other flaws, involve the use of some further issue to gain execution, injection problems need only for the data to be parsed.",

Alternately, if the weakness occurs in a privileged program, it could allow the attacker to specify commands that normally would not be accessible, or to call alternate commands with privileges that the attacker does not have. The problem is exacerbated if the compromised process does not follow the principle of least privilege, because the attacker-controlled commands may run with special system privileges that increases the amount of damage.\n\n\nThere are at least two subtypes of OS command injection:\n\n\n  - The application intends to execute a single, fixed program that is under its own control. It intends to use externally-supplied inputs as arguments to that program. For example, the program might use system(\"nslookup [HOSTNAME]\") to run nslookup and allow the user to supply a HOSTNAME, which is used as an argument. Attackers cannot prevent nslookup from executing. However, if the program does not remove command separators from the HOSTNAME argument, attackers could place the separators into the arguments, which allows them to execute their own program after nslookup has finished executing.\n\n  - The application accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run, as well as which commands to use. The application simply redirects this entire command to the operating system. For example, the program might use \"exec([COMMAND])\" to execute the [COMMAND] that was supplied by the user. If the COMMAND is under attacker control, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or programs. If the command is being executed using functions like exec() and CreateProcess(), the attacker might not be able to combine multiple commands together in the same line.\n\nFrom a weakness standpoint, these variants represent distinct programmer errors. In the first variant, the programmer clearly intends that input from untrusted parties will be part of the arguments in the command to be executed. In the second variant, the programmer does not intend for the command to be accessible to any untrusted party, but the programmer probably has not accounted for alternate ways in which malicious attackers can provide input.",

This data can be exported to a CSV file, which allows users to read the data using spreadsheet software such as Excel, Numbers, or Calc. This software interprets entries beginning with '=' as formulas, which are then executed by the spreadsheet software. The software's formula language often allows methods to access hyperlinks or the local command line, and frequently allows enough characters to invoke an entire script. Attackers can populate data fields which, when saved to a CSV file, may attempt information exfiltration or other malicious activity when automatically executed by the spreadsheet software.\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2019-12134: Low privileged user can trigger CSV injection through a contact form field value\n\n- CVE-2019-4521: Cloud management product allows arbitrary command execution via CSV injection\n\n- CVE-2019-17661: CSV injection in content management system via formula code in a first or last name\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-41128: Hygeia is an application for collecting and processing personal and case data in connection with communicable diseases. In affected versions all CSV Exports (Statistics & BAG MED) contain a CSV Injection Vulnerability. Users of the system are able to submit formula as exported fields which then get executed upon ingestion of the exported file. There is no validation or sanitization of these formula fields and so malicious may construct malicious code. This vulnerability has been resolved in version 1.30.4. There are no workarounds and all users are advised to upgrade their package.\n\n- CVE-2021-38873: IBM Planning Analytics 2.0 is potentially vulnerable to CSV Injection. A remote attacker could execute arbitrary commands on the system, caused by improper validation of csv file contents. IBM X-Force ID: 208396.\n\n- CVE-2021-28829: The Administration GUI component of TIBCO Software Inc.'s TIBCO Administrator - Enterprise Edition, TIBCO Administrator - Enterprise Edition, TIBCO Administrator - Enterprise Edition Distribution for TIBCO Silver Fabric, TIBCO Administrator - Enterprise Edition Distribution for TIBCO Silver Fabric, TIBCO Administrator - Enterprise Edition for z/Linux, and TIBCO Administrator - Enterprise Edition for z/Linux contains an easily exploitable vulnerability that allows a low privileged attacker with network access to execute a persistent CSV injection attack from the affected system. A successful attack using this vulnerability requires human interaction from a person other than the attacker. Affected releases are TIBCO Software Inc.'s TIBCO Administrator - Enterprise Edition: versions 5.10.2 and below, TIBCO Administrator - Enterprise Edition: versions 5.11.0 and 5.11.1, TIBCO Administrator - Enterprise Edition Distribution for TIBCO Silver Fabric: versions 5.10.2 and below, TIBCO Administrator - Enterprise Edition Distribution for TIBCO Silver Fabric: versions 5.11.0 and 5.11.1, TIBCO Administrator - Enterprise Edition for z/Linux: versions 5.10.2 and below, and TIBCO Administrator - Enterprise Edition for z/Linux: versions 5.11.0 and 5.11.1.\n\n- CVE-2021-22035: VMware vRealize Log Insight (8.x prior to 8.6) contains a CSV(Comma Separated Value) injection vulnerability in interactive analytics export function.

IBM X-Force ID: 198243.\n\n- CVE-2021-41270: Symfony/Serializer handles serializing and deserializing data structures for Symfony, a PHP framework for web and console applications and a set of reusable PHP components. Symfony versions 4.1.0 before 4.4.35 and versions 5.0.0 before 5.3.12 are vulnerable to CSV injection, also known as formula injection. In Symfony 4.1, maintainers added the opt-in `csv_escape_formulas` option in the `CsvEncoder`, to prefix all cells starting with `=`, `+`, `-` or `@` with a tab `\\\\t`. Since then, OWASP added 2 chars in that list: Tab (0x09) and Carriage return (0x0D). This makes the previous prefix char (Tab `\\\\t`) part of the vulnerable characters, and OWASP suggests using the single quote `'` for prefixing the value. Starting with versions 4.4.34 and 5.3.12, Symfony now follows the OWASP recommendations and uses the single quote `'` to prefix formulas and add the prefix to cells starting by `\\\\t`, `\\\\r` as well as `=`, `+`, `-` and `@`.\n\n- CVE-2021-41390: In Ericsson ECM before 18.0, it was observed that Security Provider Endpoint in the User Profile Management Section is vulnerable to CSV Injection.\n\n- CVE-2021-24144: Unvalidated input in the Contact Form 7 Database Addon plugin, versions before 1.2.5.6, was prone to a vulnerability that lets remote attackers inject arbitrary formulas into CSV files.\n\n- CVE-2021-39022: IBM Guardium Data Encryption (GDE) 4.0.0.0 and 5.0.0.0 saves user-provided information into a Comma-Separated Value (CSV) file, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as a command when the file is opened by spreadsheet software. IBM X-Force ID: 213858.\n\n- CVE-2021-46363: An issue in the Export function of Magnolia v6.2.3 and below allows attackers to perform Formula Injection attacks via crafted CSV/XLS files.

It is the lack of verification of these assumptions for user-controlled input that leads to injection problems. Injection problems encompass a wide variety of issues -- all mitigated in very different ways and usually attempted in order to alter the control flow of the process. For this reason, the most effective way to discuss these weaknesses is to note the distinct features that classify them as injection weaknesses. The most important issue to note is that all injection problems share one thing in common -- i.e., they allow for the injection of control plane data into the user-controlled data plane. This means that the execution of the process may be altered by sending code in through legitimate data channels, using no other mechanism. While buffer overflows, and many other flaws, involve the use of some further issue to gain execution, injection problems need only for the data to be parsed.\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2024-5184: API service using a large generative AI model allows direct prompt injection to leak hard-coded system prompts or execute other prompts.\n\n- CVE-2022-36069: Python-based dependency management tool avoids OS command injection when generating Git commands but allows injection of optional arguments with input beginning with a dash (CWE-88), potentially allowing for code execution.\n\n- CVE-1999-0067: Canonical example of OS command injection.

These special elements can carry control implications. If product does not prevent external control or influence over the inclusion of such special elements, the control flow of the program may be altered from what was intended. For example, both Unix and Windows interpret the symbol < (\"less than\") as meaning \"read input from a file\".\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2001-0677: Read arbitrary files from mail client by providing a special MIME header that is internally used to store pathnames for attachments.\n\n- CVE-2000-0703: Setuid program does not cleanse special escape sequence before sending data to a mail program, causing the mail program to process those sequences.\n\n- CVE-2003-0020: Multi-channel issue. Terminal escape sequences not filtered from log files.\n\n- CVE-2003-0083: Multi-channel issue. Terminal escape sequences not filtered from log files.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-33592: NAVER Toolbar before 4.0.30.323 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted upgrade.xml file. Special characters in filename parameter can be the cause of bypassing code signing check function.\n\n- CVE-2022-0661: The Ad Injection WordPress plugin through 1.2.0.19 does not properly sanitize the body of the adverts injected into the pages, allowing a high privileged user (Admin+) to inject arbitrary HTML or javascript even with unfiltered_html disallowed, leading to a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Further it is also possible to inject PHP code, leading to a Remote Code execution (RCE) vulnerability, even if the DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT and DISALLOW_FILE_MOD constants are both set.\n\n- CVE-2022-35651: A stored XSS and blind SSRF vulnerability was found in Moodle, occurs due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied data in the SCORM track details. A remote attacker can trick the victim to follow a specially crafted link and execute arbitrary HTML and script code in user's browser in context of vulnerable website to steal potentially sensitive information, change appearance of the web page, can perform phishing and drive-by-download attacks.\n\n- CVE-2022-36325: Affected devices do not properly sanitize data introduced by an user when rendering the web interface. This could allow an authenticated remote attacker with administrative privileges to inject code and lead to a DOM-based XSS.\n\n- CVE-2022-4029: The Simple:Press plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the 'sforum_[md5 hash of the WordPress URL]' cookie value in versions up to, and including, 6.8 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link. This would be highly complex to exploit as it would require the attacker to set the cookie a cookie for the targeted user.\n\n- CVE-2022-24720: image_processing is an image processing wrapper for libvips and ImageMagick/GraphicsMagick. Prior to version 1.12.2, using the `#apply` method from image_processing to apply a series of operations that are coming from unsanitized user input allows the attacker to execute shell commands. This method is called internally by Active Storage variants, so Active Storage is vulnerable as well. The vulnerability has been fixed in version 1.12.2 of image_processing. As a workaround, users who process based on user input should always sanitize the user input by allowing only a constrained set of operations.\n\n- CVE-2021-25296: Nagios XI version xi-5.7.5 is affected by OS command injection. The vulnerability exists in the file /usr/local/nagiosxi/html/includes/configwizards/windowswmi/windowswmi.inc.php due to improper sanitization of authenticated user-controlled input by a single HTTP request, which can lead to OS command injection on the Nagios XI server.\n\n- CVE-2021-25297: Nagios XI version xi-5.7.5 is affected by OS command injection.

Some CMS (Content Management Systems) also use templates.\n\n\nTemplate engines often have their own custom command or expression language. If an attacker can influence input into a template before it is processed, then the attacker can invoke arbitrary expressions, i.e. perform injection attacks. For example, in some template languages, an attacker could inject the expression \"{{7*7}}\" and determine if the output returns \"49\" instead. The syntax varies depending on the language.\n\n\nIn some cases, XSS-style attacks can work, which can obscure the root cause if the developer does not closely investigate the root cause of the error.\n\n\nTemplate engines can be used on the server or client, so both \"sides\" could be affected by injection. The mechanisms of attack or the affected technologies might be different, but the mistake is fundamentally the same.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2024-34359: Chain: Python bindings for LLM library do not use a sandboxed environment when parsing a template and constructing a prompt, allowing jinja2 Server Side Template Injection and code execution - one variant of a \"prompt injection\" attack.\n\n- CVE-2017-16783: server-side template injection in content management server\n\n- CVE-2020-9437: authentication / identity management product has client-side template injection\n\n- CVE-2020-12790: Server-Side Template Injection using a Twig template\n\n- CVE-2021-21244: devops platform allows SSTI\n\n- CVE-2020-4027: bypass of Server-Side Template Injection protection mechanism with macros in Velocity templates\n\n- CVE-2020-26282: web browser proxy server allows Java EL expressions from Server-Side Template Injection\n\n- CVE-2020-1961: SSTI involving mail templates and JEXL expressions\n\n- CVE-2019-19999: product does not use a \"safe\" setting for a FreeMarker configuration, allowing SSTI\n\n- CVE-2018-20465: product allows read of sensitive database username/password variables using server-side template injection\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-25283: An issue was discovered in through SaltStack Salt before 3002.5.

In versions before 3.0.0 vault-cli features the ability for rendering templated values. When a secret starts with the prefix `!template!`, vault-cli interprets the rest of the contents of the secret as a Jinja2 template. Jinja2 is a powerful templating engine and is not designed to safely render arbitrary templates. An attacker controlling a jinja2 template rendered on a machine can trigger arbitrary code, making this a Remote Code Execution (RCE) risk. If the content of the vault can be completely trusted, then this is not a problem. Otherwise, if your threat model includes cases where an attacker can manipulate a secret value read from the vault using vault-cli, then this vulnerability may impact you. In 3.0.0, the code related to interpreting vault templated secrets has been removed entirely. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. For users unable to upgrade a workaround does exist. Using the environment variable `VAULT_CLI_RENDER=false` or the flag `--no-render` (placed between `vault-cli` and the subcommand, e.g. `vault-cli --no-render get-all`) or adding `render: false` to the vault-cli configuration yaml file disables rendering and removes the vulnerability. Using the python library, you can use: `vault_cli.get_client(render=False)` when creating your client to get a client that will not render templated secrets and thus operates securely.\n\n- CVE-2021-46063: MCMS v5.2.5 was discovered to contain a Server Side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerability via the Template Management module.\n\n- CVE-2021-40219: Bolt CMS <= 4.2 is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution.

            "matched_text": "CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\n\nType: Class\n\nStatus: Stable\n\nDescription:\n\nThe product receives input or data, but it does\n        not validate or incorrectly validates that the input has the\n        properties that are required to process the data safely and\n        correctly.\n\nExtended Details:\n\n\n\nInput validation is a frequently-used technique for checking potentially dangerous inputs in order to ensure that the inputs are safe for processing within the code, or when communicating with other components. When software does not validate input properly, an attacker is able to craft the input in a form that is not expected by the rest of the application. This will lead to parts of the system receiving unintended input, which may result in altered control flow, arbitrary control of a resource, or arbitrary code execution.\n\n\nInput validation is not the only technique for processing input, however. Other techniques attempt to transform potentially-dangerous input into something safe, such as filtering (CWE-790) - which attempts to remove dangerous inputs - or encoding/escaping (CWE-116), which attempts to ensure that the input is not misinterpreted when it is included in output to another component. Other techniques exist as well (see CWE-138 for more examples.)\n\n\nInput validation can be applied to:\n\n\n  - raw data - strings, numbers, parameters, file contents, etc.\n\n  - metadata - information about the raw data, such as headers or size\n\nData can be simple or structured. Structured data can be composed of many nested layers, composed of combinations of metadata and raw data, with other simple or structured data.\n\nMany properties of raw data or metadata may need to be validated upon entry into the code, such as:\n\n\n  - specified quantities such as size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, etc.\n\n  - implied or derived quantities, such as the actual size of a file instead of a specified size\n\n  - indexes, offsets, or positions into more complex data structures\n\n  - symbolic keys or other elements into hash tables, associative arrays, etc.\n\n  - well-formedness, i.e. syntactic correctness - compliance with expected syntax \n\n  - lexical token correctness - compliance with rules for what is treated as a token\n\n  - specified or derived type - the actual type of the input (or what the input appears to be)\n\n  - consistency - between individual data elements, between raw data and metadata, between references, etc.\n\n  - conformance to domain-specific rules, e.g. business logic \n\n  - equivalence - ensuring that equivalent inputs are treated the same\n\n  - authenticity, ownership, or other attestations about the input, e.g. a cryptographic signature to prove the source of the data\n\nImplied or derived properties of data must often be calculated or inferred by the code itself. Errors in deriving properties may be considered a contributing factor to improper input validation. \n\nNote that \"input validation\" has very different meanings to different people, or within different classification schemes. Caution must be used when referencing this CWE entry or mapping to it. For example, some weaknesses might involve inadvertently giving control to an attacker over an input when they should not be able to provide an input at all, but sometimes this is referred to as input validation.\n\n\nFinally, it is important to emphasize that the distinctions between input validation and output escaping are often blurred, and developers must be careful to understand the difference, including how input validation is not always sufficient to prevent vulnerabilities, especially when less stringent data types must be supported, such as free-form text. Consider a SQL injection scenario in which a person's last name is inserted into a query. The name \"O'Reilly\" would likely pass the validation step since it is a common last name in the English language. However, this valid name cannot be directly inserted into the database because it contains the \"'\" apostrophe character, which would need to be escaped or otherwise transformed. In this case, removing the apostrophe might reduce the risk of SQL injection, but it would produce incorrect behavior because the wrong name would be recorded.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2024-37032: Large language model (LLM) management tool does not validate the format of a digest value (CWE-1287) from a private, untrusted model registry, enabling relative path traversal (CWE-23), a.k.a.

The implementation of `tf.raw_ops.ReverseSequence` allows for stack overflow and/or `CHECK`-fail based denial of service. The implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/5b3b071975e01f0d250c928b2a8f901cd53b90a7/tensorflow/core/kernels/reverse_sequence_op.cc#L114-L118) fails to validate that `seq_dim` and `batch_dim` arguments are valid. Negative values for `seq_dim` can result in stack overflow or `CHECK`-failure, depending on the version of Eigen code used to implement the operation. Similar behavior can be exhibited by invalid values of `batch_dim`. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0.

An attacker can read arbitrary `.md` files from the server's filesystem due to an improper input validation, which results in the ability to perform a relative path traversal. To verify if you are affected, you can try to open the following URL: `http://localhost:3000/..%2F..%2FREADME#` (replace `http://localhost:3000` with your instance's base-URL e.g. `https://demo.hedgedoc.org/..%2F..%2FREADME#`). If you see a README page being rendered, you run an affected version. The attack works due the fact that the internal router passes the url-encoded alias to the `noteController.showNote`-function. This function passes the input directly to findNote() utility function, that will pass it on the the parseNoteId()-function, that tries to make sense out of the noteId/alias and check if a note already exists and if so, if a corresponding file on disk was updated. If no note exists the note creation-function is called, which pass this unvalidated alias, with a `.md` appended, into a path.join()-function which is read from the filesystem in the follow up routine and provides the pre-filled content of the new note. This allows an attacker to not only read arbitrary `.md` files from the filesystem, but also observes changes to them. The usefulness of this attack can be considered limited, since mainly markdown files are use the file-ending `.md` and all markdown files contained in the hedgedoc project, like the README, are public anyway. If other protections such as a chroot or container or proper file permissions are in place, this attack's usefulness is rather limited. On a reverse-proxy level one can force a URL-decode, which will prevent this attack because the router will not accept such a path.\n\n- CVE-2021-43555: mySCADA myDESIGNER Versions 8.20.0 and prior fails to properly validate contents of an imported project file, which may make the product vulnerable to a path traversal payload.

Helm is a tool for managing Charts. Charts are packages of pre-configured Kubernetes resources. In Helm from version 3.0 and before version 3.5.2, there a few cases where data loaded from potentially untrusted sources was not properly sanitized. When a SemVer in the `version` field of a chart is invalid, in some cases Helm allows the string to be used \"as is\" without sanitizing. Helm fails to properly sanitized some fields present on Helm repository `index.yaml` files. Helm does not properly sanitized some fields in the `plugin.yaml` file for plugins In some cases, Helm does not properly sanitize the fields in the `Chart.yaml` file. By exploiting these attack vectors, core maintainers were able to send deceptive information to a terminal screen running the `helm` command, as well as obscure or alter information on the screen. In some cases, we could send codes that terminals used to execute higher-order logic, like clearing a terminal screen. Further, during evaluation, the Helm maintainers discovered a few other fields that were not properly sanitized when read out of repository index files. This fix remedies all such cases, and once again enforces SemVer2 policies on version fields. All users of the Helm 3 should upgrade to the fixed version 3.5.2 or later. Those who use Helm as a library should verify that they either sanitize this data on their own, or use the proper Helm API calls to sanitize the data.\n\n- CVE-2021-22331: There is a JavaScript injection vulnerability in certain Huawei smartphones.

Although the web server does not run as the root user, ZyXEL devices include a setuid utility that can be leveraged to run any command with root privileges. As such, it should be assumed that exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to remote code execution with root privileges. By sending a specially-crafted HTTP POST or GET request to a vulnerable ZyXEL device, a remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on the device. This may happen by directly connecting to a device if it is directly exposed to an attacker. However, there are ways to trigger such crafted requests even if an attacker does not have direct connectivity to a vulnerable devices. For example, simply visiting a website can result in the compromise of any ZyXEL device that is reachable from the client system. Affected products include: NAS326 before firmware V5.21(AAZF.7)C0 NAS520 before firmware V5.21(AASZ.3)C0 NAS540 before firmware V5.21(AATB.4)C0 NAS542 before firmware V5.21(ABAG.4)C0 ZyXEL has made firmware updates available for NAS326, NAS520, NAS540, and NAS542 devices. Affected models that are end-of-support: NSA210, NSA220, NSA220+, NSA221, NSA310, NSA310S, NSA320, NSA320S, NSA325 and NSA325v2\n\n- CVE-2020-1040: A remote code execution vulnerability exists when Hyper-V RemoteFX vGPU on a host server fails to properly validate input from an authenticated user on a guest operating system, aka 'Hyper-V RemoteFX vGPU Remote Code Execution Vulnerability'.

In affected versions the Admin CP's Settings management module does not validate setting types correctly on insertion and update, making it possible to add settings of supported type `php` with PHP code, executed on on _Change Settings_ pages. This results in a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability. The vulnerable module requires Admin CP access with the `Can manage settings?` permission. MyBB's Settings module, which allows administrators to add, edit, and delete non-default settings, stores setting data in an options code string ($options_code; mybb_settings.optionscode database column) that identifies the setting type and its options, separated by a new line character (\\\\n). In MyBB 1.2.0, support for setting type php was added, for which the remaining part of the options code is PHP code executed on Change Settings pages (reserved for plugins and internal use). MyBB 1.8.30 resolves this issue. There are no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-24816: JAI-EXT is an open-source project which aims to extend the Java Advanced Imaging (JAI) API. Programs allowing Jiffle script to be provided via network request can lead to a Remote Code Execution as the Jiffle script is compiled into Java code via Janino, and executed. In particular, this affects the downstream GeoServer project. Version 1.2.22 will contain a patch that disables the ability to inject malicious code into the resulting script. Users unable to upgrade may negate the ability to compile Jiffle scripts from the final application, by removing janino-x.y.z.jar from the classpath.\n\n- CVE-2022-24828: Composer is a dependency manager for the PHP programming language. Integrators using Composer code to call `VcsDriver::getFileContent` can have a code injection vulnerability if the user can control the `$file` or `$identifier` argument. This leads to a vulnerability on packagist.org for example where the composer.json's `readme` field can be used as a vector for injecting parameters into hg/Mercurial via the `$file` argument, or git via the `$identifier` argument if you allow arbitrary data there (Packagist does not, but maybe other integrators do). Composer itself should not be affected by the vulnerability as it does not call `getFileContent` with arbitrary data into `$file`/`$identifier`. To the best of our knowledge this was not abused, and the vulnerability has been patched on packagist.org and Private Packagist within a day of the vulnerability report.\n\n- CVE-2021-41144: OpenMage LTS is an e-commerce platform.

In client_golang prior to version 1.11.1, HTTP server is susceptible to a Denial of Service through unbounded cardinality, and potential memory exhaustion, when handling requests with non-standard HTTP methods. In order to be affected, an instrumented software must use any of `promhttp.InstrumentHandler*` middleware except `RequestsInFlight`; not filter any specific methods (e.g GET) before middleware; pass metric with `method` label name to our middleware; and not have any firewall/LB/proxy that filters away requests with unknown `method`. client_golang version 1.11.1 contains a patch for this issue. Several workarounds are available, including removing the `method` label name from counter/gauge used in the InstrumentHandler; turning off affected promhttp handlers; adding custom middleware before promhttp handler that will sanitize the request method given by Go http.Request; and using a reverse proxy or web application firewall, configured to only allow a limited set of methods.\n\n- CVE-2022-22543: SAP NetWeaver Application Server for ABAP (Kernel) and ABAP Platform (Kernel) - versions KERNEL 7.22, 8.04, 7.49, 7.53, 7.77, 7.81, 7.85, 7.86, 7.87, KRNL64UC 8.04, 7.22, 7.22EXT, 7.49, 7.53, KRNL64NUC 7.22, 7.22EXT, 7.49, does not sufficiently validate sap-passport information, which could lead to a Denial-of-Service attack.

Charts are packages of pre-configured Kubernetes resources. Fuzz testing, provided by the CNCF, identified input to functions in the _strvals_ package that can cause an out of memory panic. The _strvals_ package contains a parser that turns strings in to Go structures. The _strvals_ package converts these strings into structures Go can work with. Some string inputs can cause array data structures to be created causing an out of memory panic. Applications that use the _strvals_ package in the Helm SDK to parse user supplied input can suffer a Denial of Service when that input causes a panic that cannot be recovered from. The Helm Client will panic with input to `--set`, `--set-string`, and other value setting flags that causes an out of memory panic. Helm is not a long running service so the panic will not affect future uses of the Helm client. This issue has been resolved in 3.9.4. SDK users can validate strings supplied by users won't create large arrays causing significant memory usage before passing them to the _strvals_ functions.\n\n- CVE-2022-24299: Improper input validation vulnerability in pfSense CE and pfSense Plus (pfSense CE software versions prior to 2.6.0 and pfSense Plus software versions prior to 22.01) allows a remote attacker with the privilege to change OpenVPN client or server settings to execute an arbitrary command.\n\n- CVE-2022-24382: Improper input validation in firmware for some Intel(R) NUCs may allow a privileged user to potentially enable escalation of privilege via local access.\n\n- CVE-2022-24415: Dell BIOS contains an improper input validation vulnerability.

It has been discovered that TYPO3 CMS is susceptible to host spoofing due to improper validation of the HTTP Host header. TYPO3 uses the HTTP Host header, for example, to generate absolute URLs during the frontend rendering process. Since the host header itself is provided by the client, it can be forged to any value, even in a name-based virtual hosts environment. This vulnerability is the same as described in TYPO3-CORE-SA-2014-001 (CVE-2014-3941). A regression, introduced during TYPO3 v11 development, led to this situation. The already existing setting $GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['SYS']['trustedHostsPattern'] (used as an effective mitigation strategy in previous TYPO3 versions) was not evaluated anymore, and reintroduced the vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2021-41138: Frontier is Substrate's Ethereum compatibility layer. In the newly introduced signed Frontier-specific extrinsic for `pallet-ethereum`, a large part of transaction validation logic was only called in transaction pool validation, but not in block execution. Malicious validators can take advantage of this to put invalid transactions into a block. The attack is limited in that the signature is always validated, and the majority of the validation is done again in the subsequent `pallet-evm` execution logic. However, do note that a chain ID replay attack was possible. In addition, spamming attacks are of main concerns, while they are limited by Substrate block size limits and other factors. The issue is patched in commit `146bb48849e5393004be5c88beefe76fdf009aba`.\n\n- CVE-2021-4120: snapd 2.54.2 fails to perform sufficient validation of snap content interface and layout paths, resulting in the ability for snaps to inject arbitrary AppArmor policy rules via malformed content interface and layout declarations and hence escape strict snap confinement.

By crafting a special `GET` request containing a valid form state, a form can be submitted without invoking any validators. Form state is secured with an HMAC that is still verified. That means that this issue can only be exploited if Form Finishers cause side effects even if no form values have been sent. Form Finishers can be adjusted in a way that they only execute an action if the submitted form contains some expected data. Alternatively a custom Finisher can be added as first finisher. This regression was introduced with https://github.com/neos/form/commit/049d415295be8d4a0478ccba97dba1bb81649567\n\n- CVE-2021-26316: Failure to validate the communication buffer and communication service in the BIOS may allow an attacker to tamper with the buffer resulting in potential SMM (System Management Mode) arbitrary code execution.\n\n- CVE-2022-31041: Open Forms is an application for creating and publishing smart forms. Open Forms supports file uploads as one of the form field types. These fields can be configured to allow only certain file extensions to be uploaded by end users (e.g. only PDF / Excel / ...). The input validation of uploaded files is insufficient in versions prior to 1.0.9 and 1.1.1. Users could alter or strip file extensions to bypass this validation. This results in files being uploaded to the server that are of a different file type than indicated by the file name extension. These files may be downloaded (manually or automatically) by staff and/or other applications for further processing. Malicious files can therefore find their way into internal/trusted networks. Versions 1.0.9 and 1.1.1 contain patches for this issue. As a workaround, an API gateway or intrusion detection solution in front of open-forms may be able to scan for and block malicious content before it reaches the Open Forms application.\n\n- CVE-2022-29206: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning.

By using special elements such as \"..\" and \"/\" separators, attackers can escape outside of the restricted location to access files or directories that are elsewhere on the system. One of the most common special elements is the \"../\" sequence, which in most modern operating systems is interpreted as the parent directory of the current location. This is referred to as relative path traversal. Path traversal also covers the use of absolute pathnames such as \"/usr/local/bin\" to access unexpected files. This is referred to as absolute path traversal.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2024-37032: Large language model (LLM) management tool does not validate the format of a digest value (CWE-1287) from a private, untrusted model registry, enabling relative path traversal (CWE-23), a.k.a.

A path traversal vulnerability exists in versions prior to 15.3.18, 15.5.3, and 16.0.0. Using a specially prepared ZIP file, it is possible to overwrite any file that is writable by the application server user (e.g. the tomcat user). Depending on the configuration this can be limited to files of the OpenOlat user data directory, however, if not properly set up, the attack could also be used to overwrite application server config files, java code or even operating system files. The attack could be used to corrupt or modify any OpenOlat file such as course structures, config files or temporary test data. Those attack would require in-depth knowledge of the installation and thus more theoretical. If the app server configuration allows the execution of jsp files and the path to the context is known, it is also possible to execute java code. If the app server runs with the same user that is used to deploy the OpenOlat code or has write permissions on the OpenOlat code files and the path to the context is know, code injection is possible. The attack requires an OpenOlat user account to upload a ZIP file and trigger the unzip method. It can not be exploited by unregistered users. The problem is fixed in versions 15.3.18, 15.5.3 and 16.0.0. There are no known workarounds aside from upgrading.\n\n- CVE-2020-19146: Improper Access Control in Jfinal CMS v4.7.1 and earlier allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via the 'TemplatePath' parameter in the component 'jfinal_cms/admin/folder/list'.\n\n- CVE-2020-19147: Improper Access Control in Jfinal CMS v4.7.1 and earlier allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive infromation via the 'getFolder()' function in the component '/modules/filemanager/FileManager.java'.\n\n- CVE-2020-26806: admin/file.do in ObjectPlanet Opinio before 7.15 allows Unrestricted File Upload of executable JSP files, resulting in remote code execution, because filePath can have directory traversal and fileContent can be valid JSP code.\n\n- CVE-2021-20034: An improper access control vulnerability in SMA100 allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to bypass the path traversal checks and delete an arbitrary file potentially resulting in a reboot to factory default settings.\n\n- CVE-2021-23428: This affects all versions of package elFinder.NetCore.

The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input validation of URLs in HTTP requests processed by an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request containing directory traversal character sequences to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view arbitrary files within the web services file system on the targeted device. The web services file system is enabled when the affected device is configured with either WebVPN or AnyConnect features. This vulnerability cannot be used to obtain access to ASA or FTD system files or underlying operating system (OS) files.\n\n- CVE-2020-11652: An issue was discovered in SaltStack Salt before 2019.2.4 and 3000 before 3000.2. The salt-master process ClearFuncs class allows access to some methods that improperly sanitize paths. These methods allow arbitrary directory access to authenticated users.\n\n- CVE-2020-1631: A vulnerability in the HTTP/HTTPS service used by J-Web, Web Authentication, Dynamic-VPN (DVPN), Firewall Authentication Pass-Through with Web-Redirect, and Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP) allows an unauthenticated attacker to perform local file inclusion (LFI) or path traversal. Using this vulnerability, an attacker may be able to inject commands into the httpd.log, read files with 'world' readable permission file or obtain J-Web session tokens. In the case of command injection, as the HTTP service runs as user 'nobody', the impact of this command injection is limited. (CVSS score 5.3, vector CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N) In the case of reading files with 'world' readable permission, in Junos OS 19.3R1 and above, the unauthenticated attacker would be able to read the configuration file. (CVSS score 5.9, vector CVSS:3.1/ AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N) If J-Web is enabled, the attacker could gain the same level of access of anyone actively logged into J-Web. If an administrator is logged in, the attacker could gain administrator access to J-Web. (CVSS score 8.8, vector CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) This issue only affects Juniper Networks Junos OS devices with HTTP/HTTPS services enabled. Junos OS devices with HTTP/HTTPS services disabled are not affected. If HTTP/HTTPS services are enabled, the following command will show the httpd processes: user@device> show system processes | match http 5260 - S 0:00.13 /usr/sbin/httpd-gk -N 5797 - I 0:00.10 /usr/sbin/httpd --config /jail/var/etc/httpd.conf To summarize: If HTTP/HTTPS services are disabled, there is no impact from this vulnerability. If HTTP/HTTPS services are enabled and J-Web is not in use, this vulnerability has a CVSS score of 5.9 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N). If J-Web is enabled, this vulnerability has a CVSS score of 8.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H). Juniper SIRT has received a single report of this vulnerability being exploited in the wild. Out of an abundance of caution, we are notifying customers so they can take appropriate actions. Indicators of Compromise: The /var/log/httpd.log may have indicators that commands have injected or files being accessed. The device administrator can look for these indicators by searching for the string patterns \"=*;*&\" or \"*%3b*&\" in /var/log/httpd.log, using the following command: user@device> show log httpd.log | match \"=*;*&|=*%3b*&\" If this command returns any output, it might be an indication of malicious attempts or simply scanning activities. Rotated logs should also be reviewed, using the following command: user@device> show log httpd.log.0.gz | match \"=*;*&|=*%3b*&\" user@device> show log httpd.log.1.gz | match \"=*;*&|=*%3b*&\" Note that a skilled attacker would likely remove these entries from the local log file, thus effectively eliminating any reliable signature that the device had been attacked. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS 12.3 versions prior to 12.3R12-S16; 12.3X48 versions prior to 12.3X48-D101, 12.3X48-D105; 14.1X53 versions prior to 14.1X53-D54; 15.1 versions prior to 15.1R7-S7; 15.1X49 versions prior to 15.1X49-D211, 15.1X49-D220; 16.1 versions prior to 16.1R7-S8; 17.2 versions prior to 17.2R3-S4; 17.3 versions prior to 17.3R3-S8; 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R2-S11, 17.4R3-S2; 18.1 versions prior to 18.1R3-S10; 18.2 versions prior to 18.2R2-S7, 18.2R3-S4; 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R2-S4, 18.3R3-S2; 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R1-S7, 18.4R3-S2 ; 18.4 version 18.4R2 and later versions; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R1-S5, 19.1R3-S1; 19.1 version 19.1R2 and later versions; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R2; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R2-S3, 19.3R3; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R1-S2, 19.4R2; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R1-S1, 20.1R2.\n\n- CVE-2020-4430: IBM Data Risk Manager 2.0.1, 2.0.2, 2.0.3, and 2.0.4 could allow a remote authenticated attacker to traverse directories on the system.

Argo CD starting with version 1.3.0 but before versions 2.1.11, 2.2.6, and 2.3.0 is vulnerable to a path traversal bug, compounded by an improper access control bug, allowing a malicious user with read-only repository access to leak sensitive files from Argo CD's repo-server. A malicious Argo CD user who has been granted `get` access for a repository containing a Helm chart can craft an API request to the `/api/v1/repositories/{repo_url}/appdetails` endpoint to leak the contents of out-of-bounds files from the repo-server. The malicious payload would reference an out-of-bounds file, and the contents of that file would be returned as part of the response. Contents from a non-YAML file may be returned as part of an error message. The attacker would have to know or guess the location of the target file. Sensitive files which could be leaked include files from other Applications' source repositories or any secrets which have been mounted as files on the repo-server. This vulnerability is patched in Argo CD versions 2.1.11, 2.2.6, and 2.3.0. The patches prevent path traversal and limit access to users who either A) have been granted Application `create` privileges or B) have been granted Application `get` privileges and are requesting details for a `repo_url` that has already been used for the given Application. There are currently no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-27925: Zimbra Collaboration (aka ZCS) 8.8.15 and 9.0 has mboximport functionality that receives a ZIP archive and extracts files from it.

For this reason, the most effective way to discuss these weaknesses is to note the distinct features which classify them as injection weaknesses. The most important issue to note is that all injection problems share one thing in common -- i.e., they allow for the injection of control plane data into the user-controlled data plane. This means that the execution of the process may be altered by sending code in through legitimate data channels, using no other mechanism. While buffer overflows, and many other flaws, involve the use of some further issue to gain execution, injection problems need only for the data to be parsed. The most classic instantiations of this category of weakness are SQL injection and format string vulnerabilities.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2023-29374: Math component in an LLM framework translates user input into a Python expression that is input into the Python exec() method, allowing code execution - one variant of a \"prompt injection\" attack.\n\n- CVE-2024-5565: Python-based library uses an LLM prompt containing user input to dynamically generate code that is then fed as input into the Python exec() method, allowing code execution - one variant of a \"prompt injection\" attack.\n\n- CVE-2024-4181: Framework for LLM applications allows eval injection via a crafted response from a hosting provider.\n\n- CVE-2022-2054: Python compiler uses eval() to execute malicious strings as Python code.\n\n- CVE-2021-22204: Chain: regex in EXIF processor code does not correctly determine where a string ends (CWE-625), enabling eval injection (CWE-95), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2020-8218: \"Code injection\" in VPN product, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2008-5071: Eval injection in PHP program.\n\n- CVE-2002-1750: Eval injection in Perl program.\n\n- CVE-2008-5305: Eval injection in Perl program using an ID that should only contain hyphens and numbers.\n\n- CVE-2002-1752: Direct code injection into Perl eval function.\n\n- CVE-2002-1753: Eval injection in Perl program.\n\n- CVE-2005-1527: Direct code injection into Perl eval function.\n\n- CVE-2005-2837: Direct code injection into Perl eval function.\n\n- CVE-2005-1921: MFV. code injection into PHP eval statement using nested constructs that should not be nested.\n\n- CVE-2005-2498: MFV. code injection into PHP eval statement using nested constructs that should not be nested.\n\n- CVE-2005-3302: Code injection into Python eval statement from a field in a formatted file.\n\n- CVE-2007-1253: Eval injection in Python program.\n\n- CVE-2001-1471: chain: Resultant eval injection.

This, combined with the missing authorization vulnerability (CVE-2022-3400), makes it possible for authenticated attackers with minimal permissions, such as a subscriber, can edit any page, post, or template on the vulnerable WordPress website and inject a code execution block that can be used to achieve remote code execution.\n\n- CVE-2022-41882: The Nextcloud Desktop Client is a tool to synchronize files from Nextcloud Server with your computer. In version 3.6.0, if a user received a malicious file share and has it synced locally or the virtual filesystem enabled and clicked a nc://open/ link it will open the default editor for the file type of the shared file, which on Windows can also sometimes mean that a file depending on the type, e.g. \"vbs\", is being executed. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Desktop client is upgraded to version 3.6.1. As a workaround, users can block the Nextcloud Desktop client 3.6.0 by setting the `minimum.supported.desktop.version` system config to `3.6.1` on the server, so new files designed to use this attack vector are not downloaded anymore. Already existing files can still be used. Another workaround would be to enforce shares to be accepted by setting the `sharing.force_share_accept` system config to `true` on the server, so new files designed to use this attack vector are not downloaded anymore. Already existing shares can still be abused.\n\n- CVE-2022-38078: Movable Type XMLRPC API provided by Six Apart Ltd. contains a command injection vulnerability. Sending a specially crafted message by POST method to Movable Type XMLRPC API may allow arbitrary Perl script execution, and an arbitrary OS command may be executed through it.

The specific exploit requires the application to run on Tomcat as a WAR deployment. If the application is deployed as a Spring Boot executable jar, i.e. the default, it is not vulnerable to the exploit. However, the nature of the vulnerability is more general, and there may be other ways to exploit it.\n\n- CVE-2022-29171: Sourcegraph is a fast and featureful code search and navigation engine. Versions before 3.38.0 are vulnerable to Remote Code Execution in the gitserver service. The Gitolite code host integration with Phabricator allows Sourcegraph site admins to specify a `callsignCommand`, which is used to obtain the Phabricator metadata for a Gitolite repository. An administrator who is able to edit or add a Gitolite code host and has administrative access to Sourcegraph\u2019s bundled Grafana instance can change this command arbitrarily and run it remotely. This grants direct access to the infrastructure underlying the Sourcegraph installation. The attack requires: site-admin privileges on the instance of Sourcegraph, Administrative privileges on the bundled Grafana monitoring instance, Knowledge of the gitserver IP address or DNS name (if running in Kubernetes). This can be found through Grafana. The issue is patched in version 3.38.0. You may disable Gitolite code hosts. We still highly encourage upgrading regardless of workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2021-27446: The Weintek cMT product line is vulnerable to code injection, which may allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute commands with root privileges on the operation system.\n\n- CVE-2021-39908: In all versions of GitLab CE/EE starting from 0.8.0 before 14.2.6, all versions starting from 14.3 before 14.3.4, and all versions starting from 14.4 before 14.4.1 certain Unicode characters can be abused to commit malicious code into projects without being noticed in merge request or source code viewer UI.\n\n- CVE-2022-1159: Rockwell Automation Studio 5000 Logix Designer (all versions) are vulnerable when an attacker who achieves administrator access on a workstation running Studio 5000 Logix Designer could inject controller code undetectable to a user.\n\n- CVE-2022-21831: A code injection vulnerability exists in the Active Storage >= v5.2.0 that could allow an attacker to execute code via image_processing arguments.\n\n- CVE-2022-22285: A vulnerability using PendingIntent in Reminder prior to version 12.2.05.0 in Android R(11.0) and 12.3.02.1000 in Android S(12.0) allows attackers to execute privileged action by hijacking and modifying the intent.\n\n- CVE-2022-22286: A vulnerability using PendingIntent in Bixby Routines prior to version 3.1.21.8 in Android R(11.0) and 2.6.30.5 in Android Q(10.0) allows attackers to execute privileged action by hijacking and modifying the intent.\n\n- CVE-2022-23120: A code injection vulnerability in Trend Micro Deep Security and Cloud One - Workload Security Agent for Linux version 20 and below could allow an attacker to escalate privileges and run arbitrary code in the context of root. Please note: an attacker must first obtain access to the target agent in an un-activated and unconfigured state in order to exploit this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2022-23503: TYPO3 is an open source PHP based web content management system. Versions prior to 8.7.49, 9.5.38, 10.4.33, 11.5.20, and 12.1.1 are vulnerable to Code Injection. Due to the lack of separating user-submitted data from the internal configuration in the Form Designer backend module, it is possible to inject code instructions to be processed and executed via TypoScript as PHP code. The existence of individual TypoScript instructions for a particular form item and a valid backend user account with access to the form module are needed to exploit this vulnerability. This issue is patched in versions 8.7.49 ELTS, 9.5.38 ELTS, 10.4.33, 11.5.20, 12.1.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-24663: PHP Everywhere <= 2.0.3 included functionality that allowed execution of PHP Code Snippets via WordPress shortcodes, which can be used by any authenticated user.\n\n- CVE-2022-24735: Redis is an in-memory database that persists on disk. By exploiting weaknesses in the Lua script execution environment, an attacker with access to Redis prior to version 7.0.0 or 6.2.7 can inject Lua code that will execute with the (potentially higher) privileges of another Redis user. The Lua script execution environment in Redis provides some measures that prevent a script from creating side effects that persist and can affect the execution of the same, or different script, at a later time. Several weaknesses of these measures have been publicly known for a long time, but they had no security impact as the Redis security model did not endorse the concept of users or privileges. With the introduction of ACLs in Redis 6.0, these weaknesses can be exploited by a less privileged users to inject Lua code that will execute at a later time, when a privileged user executes a Lua script. The problem is fixed in Redis versions 7.0.0 and 6.2.7. An additional workaround to mitigate this problem without patching the redis-server executable, if Lua scripting is not being used, is to block access to `SCRIPT LOAD` and `EVAL` commands using ACL rules.\n\n- CVE-2022-24817: Flux2 is an open and extensible continuous delivery solution for Kubernetes. Flux2 versions between 0.1.0 and 0.29.0, helm-controller 0.1.0 to v0.19.0, and kustomize-controller 0.1.0 to v0.23.0 are vulnerable to Code Injection via malicious Kubeconfig. In multi-tenancy deployments this can also lead to privilege escalation if the controller's service account has elevated permissions. Workarounds include disabling functionality via Validating Admission webhooks by restricting users from setting the `spec.kubeConfig` field in Flux `Kustomization` and `HelmRelease` objects. Additional mitigations include applying restrictive AppArmor and SELinux profiles on the controller\u2019s pod to limit what binaries can be executed. This vulnerability is fixed in kustomize-controller v0.23.0 and helm-controller v0.19.0, both included in flux2 v0.29.0\n\n- CVE-2022-29813: In JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA before 2022.1 local code execution via custom Pandoc path was possible\n\n- CVE-2022-29814: In JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA before 2022.1 local code execution via HTML descriptions in custom JSON schemas was possible\n\n- CVE-2022-29815: In JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA before 2022.1 local code execution via workspace settings was possible\n\n- CVE-2022-29819: In JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA before 2022.1 local code execution via links in Quick Documentation was possible\n\n- CVE-2022-29821: In JetBrains Rider before 2022.1 local code execution via links in ReSharper Quick Documentation was possible\n\n- CVE-2022-30083: EllieGrid Android Application version 3.4.1 is vulnerable to Code Injection.

Other pre-existing weaknesses can turn into security vulnerabilities if they occur while operating at raised privileges.\n\n\nPrivilege management functions can behave in some less-than-obvious ways, and they have different quirks on different platforms. These inconsistencies are particularly pronounced if you are transitioning from one non-root user to another. Signal handlers and spawned processes run at the privilege of the owning process, so if a process is running as root when a signal fires or a sub-process is executed, the signal handler or sub-process will operate with root privileges.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2007-4217: FTP client program on a certain OS runs with setuid privileges and has a buffer overflow. Most clients do not need extra privileges, so an overflow is not a vulnerability for those clients.\n\n- CVE-2008-1877: Program runs with privileges and calls another program with the same privileges, which allows read of arbitrary files.\n\n- CVE-2007-5159: OS incorrectly installs a program with setuid privileges, allowing users to gain privileges.\n\n- CVE-2008-4638: Composite: application running with high privileges (CWE-250) allows user to specify a restricted file to process, which generates a parsing error that leaks the contents of the file (CWE-209).\n\n- CVE-2008-0162: Program does not drop privileges before calling another program, allowing code execution.\n\n- CVE-2008-0368: setuid root program allows creation of arbitrary files through command line argument.\n\n- CVE-2007-3931: Installation script installs some programs as setuid when they shouldn't be.\n\n- CVE-2020-3812: mail program runs as root but does not drop its privileges before attempting to access a file. Attacker can use a symlink from their home directory to a directory only readable by root, then determine whether the file exists based on the response.\n\n- CVE-2003-0908: Product launches Help functionality while running with raised privileges, allowing command execution using Windows message to access \"open file\" dialog.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-8793: OpenSMTPD before 6.6.4 allows local users to read arbitrary files (e.g., on some Linux distributions) because of a combination of an untrusted search path in makemap.c and race conditions in the offline functionality in smtpd.c.\n\n- CVE-2021-1675: Windows Print Spooler Remote Code Execution Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-0204: A sensitive information disclosure vulnerability in delta-export configuration utility (dexp) of Juniper Networks Junos OS may allow a locally authenticated shell user the ability to create and read database files generated by the dexp utility, including password hashes of local users.

While OS or shell command strings are frequently discovered and targeted, developers may not realize that these other command languages might also be vulnerable to attacks.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nCommand injection: an attack-oriented phrase for this weakness. Note: often used when \"OS command injection\" (CWE-78) was intended.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-74\nChildOf -> CWE-74\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** CWE-77 is often misused when OS command injection (CWE-78) was intended instead [REF-1287].\n**Comments:** Ensure that the analysis focuses on the root-cause error that allows the execution of commands, as there are many weaknesses that can lead to this consequence. See Terminology Notes. If the weakness involves a command language besides OS shell invocation, then CWE-77 could be used.\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n**Suggested Alternatives:**\n- CWE-78: OS Command Injection\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Terminology]** \n\nThe \"command injection\" phrase carries different meanings, either as an attack or as a technical impact. The most common usage of \"command injection\" refers to the more-accurate OS command injection (CWE-78), but there are many command languages.\n\n\nIn vulnerability-focused analysis, the phrase may refer to any situation in which the adversary can execute commands of their own choosing, i.e., the focus is on the risk and/or technical impact of exploitation. Many proof-of-concept exploits focus on the ability to execute commands and may emphasize \"command injection.\" However, there are dozens of weaknesses that can allow execution of commands. That is, the ability to execute commands could be resultant from another weakness.\n\n\nTo some, \"command injection\" can include cases in which the functionality intentionally allows the user to specify an entire command, which is then executed. In this case, the root cause weakness might be related to missing or incorrect authorization, since an adversary should not be able to specify arbitrary commands, but some users or admins are allowed.\n\n\nCWE-77 and its descendants are specifically focused on behaviors in which the product is intentionally building a command to execute, and the adversary can inject separators into the command or otherwise change the command being executed.\n\n\n**[Other]** \n\nCommand injection is a common problem with wrapper programs.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-1509:** injection of sed script syntax (\"sed injection\")\n- **CVE-2024-5184:** API service using a large generative AI model allows direct prompt injection to leak hard-coded system prompts or execute other prompts.\n- **CVE-2020-11698:** anti-spam product allows injection of SNMP commands into confiuration file\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nThis weakness can lead to a vulnerability in environments in which the attacker does not have direct access to the operating system, such as in web applications. Alternately, if the weakness occurs in a privileged program, it could allow the attacker to specify commands that normally would not be accessible, or to call alternate commands with privileges that the attacker does not have. The problem is exacerbated if the compromised process does not follow the principle of least privilege, because the attacker-controlled commands may run with special system privileges that increases the amount of damage.\n\n\nThere are at least two subtypes of OS command injection:\n\n\n  - The application intends to execute a single, fixed program that is under its own control. It intends to use externally-supplied inputs as arguments to that program. For example, the program might use system(\"nslookup [HOSTNAME]\") to run nslookup and allow the user to supply a HOSTNAME, which is used as an argument. Attackers cannot prevent nslookup from executing. However, if the program does not remove command separators from the HOSTNAME argument, attackers could place the separators into the arguments, which allows them to execute their own program after nslookup has finished executing.\n\n  - The application accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run, as well as which commands to use. The application simply redirects this entire command to the operating system. For example, the program might use \"exec([COMMAND])\" to execute the [COMMAND] that was supplied by the user. If the COMMAND is under attacker control, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or programs. If the command is being executed using functions like exec() and CreateProcess(), the attacker might not be able to combine multiple commands together in the same line.\n\nFrom a weakness standpoint, these variants represent distinct programmer errors. In the first variant, the programmer clearly intends that input from untrusted parties will be part of the arguments in the command to be executed. In the second variant, the programmer does not intend for the command to be accessible to any untrusted party, but the programmer probably has not accounted for alternate ways in which malicious attackers can provide input.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nShell injection\nShell metacharacters\nOS Command Injection\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-77\nChildOf -> CWE-74\nChildOf -> CWE-77\nChildOf -> CWE-77\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-88\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Terminology]** The \"OS command injection\" phrase carries different meanings to different people. For some people, it only refers to cases in which the attacker injects command separators into arguments for an application-controlled program that is being invoked. For some people, it refers to any type of attack that can allow the attacker to execute OS commands of their own choosing. This usage could include untrusted search path weaknesses (CWE-426) that cause the application to find and execute an attacker-controlled program. Further complicating the issue is the case when argument injection (CWE-88) allows alternate command-line switches or options to be inserted into the command line, such as an \"-exec\" switch whose purpose may be to execute the subsequent argument as a command (this -exec switch exists in the UNIX \"find\" command, for example). In this latter case, however, CWE-88 could be regarded as the primary weakness in a chain with CWE-78.\n\n**[Research Gap]** More investigation is needed into the distinction between the OS command injection variants, including the role with argument injection (CWE-88). Equivalent distinctions may exist in other injection-related problems such as SQL injection.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2020-10987:** OS command injection in Wi-Fi router, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2020-10221:** Template functionality in network configuration management tool allows OS command injection, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2020-9054:** Chain: improper input validation (CWE-20) in username parameter, leading to OS command injection (CWE-78), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-1236: Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product saves user-provided information into a Comma-Separated Value (CSV) file, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as a command when the file is opened by a spreadsheet product.\n\n### Extended Description\nUser-provided data is often saved to traditional databases. This data can be exported to a CSV file, which allows users to read the data using spreadsheet software such as Excel, Numbers, or Calc. This software interprets entries beginning with '=' as formulas, which are then executed by the spreadsheet software. The software's formula language often allows methods to access hyperlinks or the local command line, and frequently allows enough characters to invoke an entire script. Attackers can populate data fields which, when saved to a CSV file, may attempt information exfiltration or other malicious activity when automatically executed by the spreadsheet software.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nCSV Injection\nFormula Injection\nExcel Macro Injection\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-74\nChildOf -> CWE-74\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

It is the lack of verification of these assumptions for user-controlled input that leads to injection problems. Injection problems encompass a wide variety of issues -- all mitigated in very different ways and usually attempted in order to alter the control flow of the process. For this reason, the most effective way to discuss these weaknesses is to note the distinct features that classify them as injection weaknesses. The most important issue to note is that all injection problems share one thing in common -- i.e., they allow for the injection of control plane data into the user-controlled data plane. This means that the execution of the process may be altered by sending code in through legitimate data channels, using no other mechanism. While buffer overflows, and many other flaws, involve the use of some further issue to gain execution, injection problems need only for the data to be parsed.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-707\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n**Comments:** Examine the children and descendants of this entry to find a more precise mapping.\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Theoretical]** Many people treat injection only as an input validation problem (CWE-20) because many people do not distinguish between the consequence/attack (injection) and the protection mechanism that prevents the attack from succeeding. However, input validation is only one potential protection mechanism (output encoding is another), and there is a chaining relationship between improper input validation and the improper enforcement of the structure of messages to other components. Other issues not directly related to input validation, such as race conditions, could similarly impact message structure.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2024-5184:** API service using a large generative AI model allows direct prompt injection to leak hard-coded system prompts or execute other prompts.\n- **CVE-2022-36069:** Python-based dependency management tool avoids OS command injection when generating Git commands but allows injection of optional arguments with input beginning with a dash (CWE-88), potentially allowing for code execution.\n- **CVE-1999-0067:** Canonical example of OS command injection. CGI program does not neutralize \"|\" metacharacter when invoking a phonebook program.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component. Without sufficient removal or quoting of SQL syntax in user-controllable inputs, the generated SQL query can cause those inputs to be interpreted as SQL instead of ordinary user data.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nSQL injection: a common attack-oriented phrase\nSQLi: a common abbreviation for \"SQL injection\"\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-943\nChildOf -> CWE-74\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

It can be primary to authentication errors.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2023-32530:** SQL injection in security product dashboard using crafted certificate fields\n- **CVE-2021-42258:** SQL injection in time and billing software, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2021-27101:** SQL injection in file-transfer system via a crafted Host header, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not properly assign, modify, track, or check privileges for an actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** CWE-269 is commonly misused. It can be conflated with \"privilege escalation,\" which is a technical impact that is listed in many low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is not useful for trend analysis.\n**Comments:** If an error or mistake allows privilege escalation, then use the CWE ID for that mistake. Avoid using CWE-269 when only phrases such as \"privilege escalation\" or \"gain privileges\" are available, as these indicate technical impact of the vulnerability - not the root cause weakness. If the root cause seems to be directly related to privileges, then examine the children of CWE-269 for additional hints, such as Execution with Unnecessary Privileges (CWE-250) or Incorrect Privilege Assignment (CWE-266).\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** The relationships between privileges, permissions, and actors (e.g. users and groups) need further refinement within the Research view. One complication is that these concepts apply to two different pillars, related to control of resources (CWE-664) and protection mechanism failures (CWE-693).\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2001-1555:** Terminal privileges are not reset when a user logs out.\n- **CVE-2001-1514:** Does not properly pass security context to child processes in certain cases, allows privilege escalation.\n- **CVE-2001-0128:** Does not properly compute roles.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nCross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:\n\n\n  1. Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.\n\n  1. The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.\n\n  1. During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.\n\n  1. A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.\n\n  1. Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.\n\n  1. This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.\n\nThere are three main kinds of XSS:\n\n  -  **Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent)**  - The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.\n\n  -  **Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent)**  - The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs. \n\n  -  **Type 0: DOM-Based XSS**  - In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible. \n\nOnce the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"\n\nIn many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nXSS: A common abbreviation for Cross-Site Scripting.\nHTML Injection: Used as a synonym of stored (Type 2) XSS.\nCSS: In the early years after initial discovery of XSS, \"CSS\" was a commonly-used acronym. However, this would cause confusion with \"Cascading Style Sheets,\" so usage of this acronym has declined significantly.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-74\nChildOf -> CWE-74\nCanPrecede -> CWE-494\nPeerOf -> CWE-352\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** \n\nThere can be a close relationship between XSS and CSRF (CWE-352). An attacker might use CSRF in order to trick the victim into submitting requests to the server in which the requests contain an XSS payload. A well-known example of this was the Samy worm on MySpace [REF-956]. The worm used XSS to insert malicious HTML sequences into a user's profile and add the attacker as a MySpace friend. MySpace friends of that victim would then execute the payload to modify their own profiles, causing the worm to propagate exponentially. Since the victims did not intentionally insert the malicious script themselves, CSRF was a root cause.\n\n\n**[Applicable Platform]** \n\nXSS flaws are very common in web applications, since they require a great deal of developer discipline to avoid them.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-25926:** Python Library Manager did not sufficiently neutralize a user-supplied search term, allowing reflected XSS.\n- **CVE-2021-25963:** Python-based e-commerce platform did not escape returned content on error pages, allowing for reflected Cross-Site Scripting attacks.\n- **CVE-2021-1879:** Universal XSS in mobile operating system, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n### Extended Description\nMost languages and protocols have their own special elements such as characters and reserved words. These special elements can carry control implications. If product does not prevent external control or influence over the inclusion of such special elements, the control flow of the program may be altered from what was intended. For example, both Unix and Windows interpret the symbol < (\"less than\") as meaning \"read input from a file\".\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-707\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This weakness can be related to interpretation conflicts or interaction errors in intermediaries (such as proxies or application firewalls) when the intermediary's model of an endpoint does not account for protocol-specific special elements.\n\n**[Relationship]** See this entry's children for different types of special elements that have been observed at one point or another. However, it can be difficult to find suitable CVE examples. In an attempt to be complete, CWE includes some types that do not have any associated observed example.\n\n**[Research Gap]** This weakness is probably under-studied for proprietary or custom formats. It is likely that these issues are fairly common in applications that use their own custom format for configuration files, logs, meta-data, messaging, etc. They would only be found by accident or with a focused effort based on an understanding of the format.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2001-0677:** Read arbitrary files from mail client by providing a special MIME header that is internally used to store pathnames for attachments.\n- **CVE-2000-0703:** Setuid program does not cleanse special escape sequence before sending data to a mail program, causing the mail program to process those sequences.\n- **CVE-2003-0020:** Multi-channel issue. Terminal escape sequences not filtered from log files.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-1336: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product uses a template engine to insert or process externally-influenced input, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements or syntax that can be interpreted as template expressions or other code directives when processed by the engine.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nMany web applications use template engines that allow developers to insert externally-influenced values into free text or messages in order to generate a full web page, document, message, etc. Such engines include Twig, Jinja2, Pug, Java Server Pages, FreeMarker, Velocity, ColdFusion, Smarty, and many others - including PHP itself. Some CMS (Content Management Systems) also use templates.\n\n\nTemplate engines often have their own custom command or expression language. If an attacker can influence input into a template before it is processed, then the attacker can invoke arbitrary expressions, i.e. perform injection attacks. For example, in some template languages, an attacker could inject the expression \"{{7*7}}\" and determine if the output returns \"49\" instead. The syntax varies depending on the language.\n\n\nIn some cases, XSS-style attacks can work, which can obscure the root cause if the developer does not closely investigate the root cause of the error.\n\n\nTemplate engines can be used on the server or client, so both \"sides\" could be affected by injection. The mechanisms of attack or the affected technologies might be different, but the mistake is fundamentally the same.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nServer-Side Template Injection / SSTI: This term is used for injection into template engines being used by a server.\nClient-Side Template Injection / CSTI: This term is used for injection into template engines being used by a client.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-94\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** Since expression languages are often used in templating languages, there may be some overlap with CWE-917 (Expression Language Injection). XSS (CWE-79) is also co-located with template injection.\n\n**[Maintenance]** The interrelationships and differences between CWE-917 and CWE-1336 need to be further clarified.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2024-34359:** Chain: Python bindings for LLM library do not use a sandboxed environment when parsing a template and constructing a prompt, allowing jinja2 Server Side Template Injection and code execution - one variant of a \"prompt injection\" attack.\n- **CVE-2017-16783:** server-side template injection in content management server\n- **CVE-2020-9437:** authentication / identity management product has client-side template injection\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product receives input or data, but it does\n        not validate or incorrectly validates that the input has the\n        properties that are required to process the data safely and\n        correctly.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nInput validation is a frequently-used technique for checking potentially dangerous inputs in order to ensure that the inputs are safe for processing within the code, or when communicating with other components. When software does not validate input properly, an attacker is able to craft the input in a form that is not expected by the rest of the application. This will lead to parts of the system receiving unintended input, which may result in altered control flow, arbitrary control of a resource, or arbitrary code execution.\n\n\nInput validation is not the only technique for processing input, however. Other techniques attempt to transform potentially-dangerous input into something safe, such as filtering (CWE-790) - which attempts to remove dangerous inputs - or encoding/escaping (CWE-116), which attempts to ensure that the input is not misinterpreted when it is included in output to another component. Other techniques exist as well (see CWE-138 for more examples.)\n\n\nInput validation can be applied to:\n\n\n  - raw data - strings, numbers, parameters, file contents, etc.\n\n  - metadata - information about the raw data, such as headers or size\n\nData can be simple or structured. Structured data can be composed of many nested layers, composed of combinations of metadata and raw data, with other simple or structured data.\n\nMany properties of raw data or metadata may need to be validated upon entry into the code, such as:\n\n\n  - specified quantities such as size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, etc.\n\n  - implied or derived quantities, such as the actual size of a file instead of a specified size\n\n  - indexes, offsets, or positions into more complex data structures\n\n  - symbolic keys or other elements into hash tables, associative arrays, etc.\n\n  - well-formedness, i.e. syntactic correctness - compliance with expected syntax \n\n  - lexical token correctness - compliance with rules for what is treated as a token\n\n  - specified or derived type - the actual type of the input (or what the input appears to be)\n\n  - consistency - between individual data elements, between raw data and metadata, between references, etc.\n\n  - conformance to domain-specific rules, e.g. business logic \n\n  - equivalence - ensuring that equivalent inputs are treated the same\n\n  - authenticity, ownership, or other attestations about the input, e.g. a cryptographic signature to prove the source of the data\n\nImplied or derived properties of data must often be calculated or inferred by the code itself. Errors in deriving properties may be considered a contributing factor to improper input validation. \n\nNote that \"input validation\" has very different meanings to different people, or within different classification schemes. Caution must be used when referencing this CWE entry or mapping to it. For example, some weaknesses might involve inadvertently giving control to an attacker over an input when they should not be able to provide an input at all, but sometimes this is referred to as input validation.\n\n\nFinally, it is important to emphasize that the distinctions between input validation and output escaping are often blurred, and developers must be careful to understand the difference, including how input validation is not always sufficient to prevent vulnerabilities, especially when less stringent data types must be supported, such as free-form text. Consider a SQL injection scenario in which a person's last name is inserted into a query. The name \"O'Reilly\" would likely pass the validation step since it is a common last name in the English language. However, this valid name cannot be directly inserted into the database because it contains the \"'\" apostrophe character, which would need to be escaped or otherwise transformed. In this case, removing the apostrophe might reduce the risk of SQL injection, but it would produce incorrect behavior because the wrong name would be recorded.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-707\nPeerOf -> CWE-345\nCanPrecede -> CWE-22\nCanPrecede -> CWE-41\nCanPrecede -> CWE-74\nCanPrecede -> CWE-119\nCanPrecede -> CWE-770\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** CWE-20 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available [REF-1287]. It is not useful for trend analysis. It is also a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).\n**Comments:** Consider lower-level children such as Improper Use of Validation Framework (CWE-1173) or improper validation involving specific types or properties of input such as Specified Quantity (CWE-1284); Specified Index, Position, or Offset (CWE-1285); Syntactic Correctness (CWE-1286); Specified Type (CWE-1287); Consistency within Input (CWE-1288); or Unsafe Equivalence (CWE-1289).\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n**Suggested Alternatives:**\n- CWE-1284: Specified Quantity\n- CWE-1285: Specified Index, Position, or Offset\n- CWE-1286: Syntactic Correctness\n- CWE-1287: Specified Type\n- CWE-1288: Consistency within Input\n- CWE-1289: Unsafe Equivalence\n- CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** \n\nCWE-116 and CWE-20 have a close association because, depending on the nature of the structured message, proper input validation can indirectly prevent special characters from changing the meaning of a structured message. For example, by validating that a numeric ID field should only contain the 0-9 characters, the programmer effectively prevents injection attacks.\n\n\n**[Maintenance]** As of 2020, this entry is used more often than preferred, and it is a source of frequent confusion. It is being actively modified for CWE 4.1 and subsequent versions.\n\n**[Maintenance]** Concepts such as validation, data transformation, and neutralization are being refined, so relationships between CWE-20 and other entries such as CWE-707 may change in future versions, along with an update to the Vulnerability Theory document.\n\n**[Maintenance]** Input validation - whether missing or incorrect - is such an essential and widespread part of secure development that it is implicit in many different weaknesses. Traditionally, problems such as buffer overflows and XSS have been classified as input validation problems by many security professionals. However, input validation is not necessarily the only protection mechanism available for avoiding such problems, and in some cases it is not even sufficient. The CWE team has begun capturing these subtleties in chains within the Research Concepts view (CWE-1000), but more work is needed.\n\n**[Terminology]** \n\nThe \"input validation\" term is extremely common, but it is used in many different ways. In some cases its usage can obscure the real underlying weakness or otherwise hide chaining and composite relationships.\n\n\nSome people use \"input validation\" as a general term that covers many different neutralization techniques for ensuring that input is appropriate, such as filtering, canonicalization, and escaping. Others use the term in a more narrow context to simply mean \"checking if an input conforms to expectations without changing it.\" CWE uses this more narrow interpretation.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2024-37032:** Large language model (LLM) management tool does not validate the format of a digest value (CWE-1287) from a private, untrusted model registry, enabling relative path traversal (CWE-23), a.k.a. Probllama\n- **CVE-2022-45918:** Chain: a learning management tool debugger uses external input to locate previous session logs (CWE-73) and does not properly validate the given path (CWE-20), allowing for filesystem path traversal using \"../\" sequences (CWE-24)\n- **CVE-2021-30860:** Chain: improper input validation (CWE-20) leads to integer overflow (CWE-190) in mobile OS, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n",

This data can be exported to a CSV file, which allows users to read the data using spreadsheet software such as Excel, Numbers, or Calc. This software interprets entries beginning with '=' as formulas, which are then executed by the spreadsheet software. The software's formula language often allows methods to access hyperlinks or the local command line, and frequently allows enough characters to invoke an entire script. Attackers can populate data fields which, when saved to a CSV file, may attempt information exfiltration or other malicious activity when automatically executed by the spreadsheet software.\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2019-12134: Low privileged user can trigger CSV injection through a contact form field value\n\n- CVE-2019-4521: Cloud management product allows arbitrary command execution via CSV injection\n\n- CVE-2019-17661: CSV injection in content management system via formula code in a first or last name\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-41128: Hygeia is an application for collecting and processing personal and case data in connection with communicable diseases. In affected versions all CSV Exports (Statistics & BAG MED) contain a CSV Injection Vulnerability. Users of the system are able to submit formula as exported fields which then get executed upon ingestion of the exported file. There is no validation or sanitization of these formula fields and so malicious may construct malicious code. This vulnerability has been resolved in version 1.30.4. There are no workarounds and all users are advised to upgrade their package.\n\n- CVE-2021-38873: IBM Planning Analytics 2.0 is potentially vulnerable to CSV Injection. A remote attacker could execute arbitrary commands on the system, caused by improper validation of csv file contents. IBM X-Force ID: 208396.\n\n- CVE-2021-28829: The Administration GUI component of TIBCO Software Inc.'s TIBCO Administrator - Enterprise Edition, TIBCO Administrator - Enterprise Edition, TIBCO Administrator - Enterprise Edition Distribution for TIBCO Silver Fabric, TIBCO Administrator - Enterprise Edition Distribution for TIBCO Silver Fabric, TIBCO Administrator - Enterprise Edition for z/Linux, and TIBCO Administrator - Enterprise Edition for z/Linux contains an easily exploitable vulnerability that allows a low privileged attacker with network access to execute a persistent CSV injection attack from the affected system. A successful attack using this vulnerability requires human interaction from a person other than the attacker. Affected releases are TIBCO Software Inc.'s TIBCO Administrator - Enterprise Edition: versions 5.10.2 and below, TIBCO Administrator - Enterprise Edition: versions 5.11.0 and 5.11.1, TIBCO Administrator - Enterprise Edition Distribution for TIBCO Silver Fabric: versions 5.10.2 and below, TIBCO Administrator - Enterprise Edition Distribution for TIBCO Silver Fabric: versions 5.11.0 and 5.11.1, TIBCO Administrator - Enterprise Edition for z/Linux: versions 5.10.2 and below, and TIBCO Administrator - Enterprise Edition for z/Linux: versions 5.11.0 and 5.11.1.\n\n- CVE-2021-22035: VMware vRealize Log Insight (8.x prior to 8.6) contains a CSV(Comma Separated Value) injection vulnerability in interactive analytics export function. An authenticated malicious actor with non-administrative privileges may be able to embed untrusted data prior to exporting a CSV sheet through Log Insight which could be executed in user's environment.\n\n- CVE-2021-20509: IBM Maximo Asset Management 7.6.0 and 7.6.1 is potentially vulnerable to CSV Injection. A remote attacker could execute arbitrary commands on the system, caused by improper validation of csv file contents. IBM X-Force ID: 198243.\n\n- CVE-2021-41270: Symfony/Serializer handles serializing and deserializing data structures for Symfony, a PHP framework for web and console applications and a set of reusable PHP components. Symfony versions 4.1.0 before 4.4.35 and versions 5.0.0 before 5.3.12 are vulnerable to CSV injection, also known as formula injection. In Symfony 4.1, maintainers added the opt-in `csv_escape_formulas` option in the `CsvEncoder`, to prefix all cells starting with `=`, `+`, `-` or `@` with a tab `\\\\t`. Since then, OWASP added 2 chars in that list: Tab (0x09) and Carriage return (0x0D). This makes the previous prefix char (Tab `\\\\t`) part of the vulnerable characters, and OWASP suggests using the single quote `'` for prefixing the value. Starting with versions 4.4.34 and 5.3.12, Symfony now follows the OWASP recommendations and uses the single quote `'` to prefix formulas and add the prefix to cells starting by `\\\\t`, `\\\\r` as well as `=`, `+`, `-` and `@`.\n\n- CVE-2021-41390: In Ericsson ECM before 18.0, it was observed that Security Provider Endpoint in the User Profile Management Section is vulnerable to CSV Injection.\n\n- CVE-2021-24144: Unvalidated input in the Contact Form 7 Database Addon plugin, versions before 1.2.5.6, was prone to a vulnerability that lets remote attackers inject arbitrary formulas into CSV files.\n\n- CVE-2021-39022: IBM Guardium Data Encryption (GDE) 4.0.0.0 and 5.0.0.0 saves user-provided information into a Comma-Separated Value (CSV) file, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as a command when the file is opened by spreadsheet software. IBM X-Force ID: 213858.\n\n- CVE-2021-46363: An issue in the Export function of Magnolia v6.2.3 and below allows attackers to perform Formula Injection attacks via crafted CSV/XLS files.

It is the lack of verification of these assumptions for user-controlled input that leads to injection problems. Injection problems encompass a wide variety of issues -- all mitigated in very different ways and usually attempted in order to alter the control flow of the process. For this reason, the most effective way to discuss these weaknesses is to note the distinct features that classify them as injection weaknesses. The most important issue to note is that all injection problems share one thing in common -- i.e., they allow for the injection of control plane data into the user-controlled data plane. This means that the execution of the process may be altered by sending code in through legitimate data channels, using no other mechanism. While buffer overflows, and many other flaws, involve the use of some further issue to gain execution, injection problems need only for the data to be parsed.\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2024-5184: API service using a large generative AI model allows direct prompt injection to leak hard-coded system prompts or execute other prompts.\n\n- CVE-2022-36069: Python-based dependency management tool avoids OS command injection when generating Git commands but allows injection of optional arguments with input beginning with a dash (CWE-88), potentially allowing for code execution.\n\n- CVE-1999-0067: Canonical example of OS command injection.

Note: Software versions which have reached End of Technical Support (EoTS) are not evaluated.\n\n- CVE-2022-35954: The GitHub Actions ToolKit provides a set of packages to make creating actions easier. The `core.exportVariable` function uses a well known delimiter that attackers can use to break out of that specific variable and assign values to other arbitrary variables. Workflows that write untrusted values to the `GITHUB_ENV` file may cause the path or other environment variables to be modified without the intention of the workflow or action author. Users should upgrade to `@actions/core v1.9.1`. If you are unable to upgrade the `@actions/core` package, you can modify your action to ensure that any user input does not contain the delimiter `_GitHubActionsFileCommandDelimeter_` before calling `core.exportVariable`.\n\n- CVE-2022-46265: A vulnerability has been identified in Polarion ALM (All versions < V2304.0).

Sensitive user data (bank account details, password Hash) can be extracted via Ransack query injection. Every deployment of travel-support-program below the patched version is affected. The travel-support-program uses the Ransack library to implement search functionality. In its default configuration, Ransack will allow for query conditions based on properties of associated database objects [1]. The `*_start`, `*_end` or `*_cont` search matchers [2] can then be abused to exfiltrate sensitive string values of associated database objects via character-by-character brute-force (A match is indicated by the returned JSON not being empty). A single bank account number can be extracted with <200 requests, a password hash can be extracted with ~1200 requests, all within a few minutes. The problem has been patched in commit d22916275c51500b4004933ff1b0a69bc807b2b7.

These special elements can carry control implications. If product does not prevent external control or influence over the inclusion of such special elements, the control flow of the program may be altered from what was intended. For example, both Unix and Windows interpret the symbol < (\"less than\") as meaning \"read input from a file\".\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2001-0677: Read arbitrary files from mail client by providing a special MIME header that is internally used to store pathnames for attachments.\n\n- CVE-2000-0703: Setuid program does not cleanse special escape sequence before sending data to a mail program, causing the mail program to process those sequences.\n\n- CVE-2003-0020: Multi-channel issue. Terminal escape sequences not filtered from log files.\n\n- CVE-2003-0083: Multi-channel issue. Terminal escape sequences not filtered from log files.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-33592: NAVER Toolbar before 4.0.30.323 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted upgrade.xml file. Special characters in filename parameter can be the cause of bypassing code signing check function.\n\n- CVE-2022-0661: The Ad Injection WordPress plugin through 1.2.0.19 does not properly sanitize the body of the adverts injected into the pages, allowing a high privileged user (Admin+) to inject arbitrary HTML or javascript even with unfiltered_html disallowed, leading to a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Further it is also possible to inject PHP code, leading to a Remote Code execution (RCE) vulnerability, even if the DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT and DISALLOW_FILE_MOD constants are both set.\n\n- CVE-2022-35651: A stored XSS and blind SSRF vulnerability was found in Moodle, occurs due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied data in the SCORM track details. A remote attacker can trick the victim to follow a specially crafted link and execute arbitrary HTML and script code in user's browser in context of vulnerable website to steal potentially sensitive information, change appearance of the web page, can perform phishing and drive-by-download attacks.\n\n- CVE-2022-36325: Affected devices do not properly sanitize data introduced by an user when rendering the web interface. This could allow an authenticated remote attacker with administrative privileges to inject code and lead to a DOM-based XSS.\n\n- CVE-2022-4029: The Simple:Press plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the 'sforum_[md5 hash of the WordPress URL]' cookie value in versions up to, and including, 6.8 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link. This would be highly complex to exploit as it would require the attacker to set the cookie a cookie for the targeted user.\n\n- CVE-2022-24720: image_processing is an image processing wrapper for libvips and ImageMagick/GraphicsMagick. Prior to version 1.12.2, using the `#apply` method from image_processing to apply a series of operations that are coming from unsanitized user input allows the attacker to execute shell commands. This method is called internally by Active Storage variants, so Active Storage is vulnerable as well. The vulnerability has been fixed in version 1.12.2 of image_processing. As a workaround, users who process based on user input should always sanitize the user input by allowing only a constrained set of operations.\n\n- CVE-2021-25296: Nagios XI version xi-5.7.5 is affected by OS command injection. The vulnerability exists in the file /usr/local/nagiosxi/html/includes/configwizards/windowswmi/windowswmi.inc.php due to improper sanitization of authenticated user-controlled input by a single HTTP request, which can lead to OS command injection on the Nagios XI server.\n\n- CVE-2021-25297: Nagios XI version xi-5.7.5 is affected by OS command injection.

This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series and EX Series: All versions prior to 19.2R1-S9, 19.2R3-S5; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R3-S6; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R3-S8; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R3-S4; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R3-S4; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R3-S3; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R3-S2, 20.4R3-S3; 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R3-S1; 21.2 versions prior to 21.2R2-S2, 21.2R3; 21.3 versions prior to 21.3R2, 21.3R3; 21.4 versions prior to 21.4R1-S1, 21.4R2.\n\n- CVE-2022-3047: Insufficient policy enforcement in Extensions API in Google Chrome prior to 105.0.5195.52 allowed an attacker who convinced a user to install a malicious extension to bypass downloads policy via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2022-21705: Octobercms is a self-hosted CMS platform based on the Laravel PHP Framework. In affected versions user input was not properly sanitized before rendering. An authenticated user with the permissions to create, modify and delete website pages can exploit this vulnerability to bypass `cms.safe_mode` / `cms.enableSafeMode` in order to execute arbitrary code. This issue only affects admin panels that rely on safe mode and restricted permissions. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must first have access to the backend area. The issue has been patched in Build 474 (v1.0.474) and v1.1.10. Users unable to upgrade should apply https://github.com/octobercms/library/commit/c393c5ce9ca2c5acc3ed6c9bb0dab5ffd61965fe to your installation manually.\n\n- CVE-2022-24039: A vulnerability has been identified in Desigo PXC4 (All versions < V02.20.142.10-10884), Desigo PXC5 (All versions < V02.20.142.10-10884). The \u201caddCell\u201d JavaScript function fails to properly sanitize user-controllable input before including it into the generated XML body of the XLS report document, such that it is possible to inject arbitrary content (e.g., XML tags) into the generated file. An attacker with restricted privileges, by poisoning any of the content used to generate XLS reports, could be able to leverage the application to deliver malicious files against higher-privileged users and obtain Remote Code Execution (RCE) against the administrator\u2019s workstation.\n\n- CVE-2022-35948: undici is an HTTP/1.1 client, written from scratch for Node.js.`=< undici@5.8.0` users are vulnerable to _CRLF Injection_ on headers when using unsanitized input as request headers, more specifically, inside the `content-type` header.

Some CMS (Content Management Systems) also use templates.\n\n\nTemplate engines often have their own custom command or expression language. If an attacker can influence input into a template before it is processed, then the attacker can invoke arbitrary expressions, i.e. perform injection attacks. For example, in some template languages, an attacker could inject the expression \"{{7*7}}\" and determine if the output returns \"49\" instead. The syntax varies depending on the language.\n\n\nIn some cases, XSS-style attacks can work, which can obscure the root cause if the developer does not closely investigate the root cause of the error.\n\n\nTemplate engines can be used on the server or client, so both \"sides\" could be affected by injection. The mechanisms of attack or the affected technologies might be different, but the mistake is fundamentally the same.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2024-34359: Chain: Python bindings for LLM library do not use a sandboxed environment when parsing a template and constructing a prompt, allowing jinja2 Server Side Template Injection and code execution - one variant of a \"prompt injection\" attack.\n\n- CVE-2017-16783: server-side template injection in content management server\n\n- CVE-2020-9437: authentication / identity management product has client-side template injection\n\n- CVE-2020-12790: Server-Side Template Injection using a Twig template\n\n- CVE-2021-21244: devops platform allows SSTI\n\n- CVE-2020-4027: bypass of Server-Side Template Injection protection mechanism with macros in Velocity templates\n\n- CVE-2020-26282: web browser proxy server allows Java EL expressions from Server-Side Template Injection\n\n- CVE-2020-1961: SSTI involving mail templates and JEXL expressions\n\n- CVE-2019-19999: product does not use a \"safe\" setting for a FreeMarker configuration, allowing SSTI\n\n- CVE-2018-20465: product allows read of sensitive database username/password variables using server-side template injection\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-25283: An issue was discovered in through SaltStack Salt before 3002.5.

In versions before 3.0.0 vault-cli features the ability for rendering templated values. When a secret starts with the prefix `!template!`, vault-cli interprets the rest of the contents of the secret as a Jinja2 template. Jinja2 is a powerful templating engine and is not designed to safely render arbitrary templates. An attacker controlling a jinja2 template rendered on a machine can trigger arbitrary code, making this a Remote Code Execution (RCE) risk. If the content of the vault can be completely trusted, then this is not a problem. Otherwise, if your threat model includes cases where an attacker can manipulate a secret value read from the vault using vault-cli, then this vulnerability may impact you. In 3.0.0, the code related to interpreting vault templated secrets has been removed entirely. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. For users unable to upgrade a workaround does exist. Using the environment variable `VAULT_CLI_RENDER=false` or the flag `--no-render` (placed between `vault-cli` and the subcommand, e.g. `vault-cli --no-render get-all`) or adding `render: false` to the vault-cli configuration yaml file disables rendering and removes the vulnerability. Using the python library, you can use: `vault_cli.get_client(render=False)` when creating your client to get a client that will not render templated secrets and thus operates securely.\n\n- CVE-2021-46063: MCMS v5.2.5 was discovered to contain a Server Side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerability via the Template Management module.\n\n- CVE-2021-40219: Bolt CMS <= 4.2 is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution.

When software does not validate input properly, an attacker is able to craft the input in a form that is not expected by the rest of the application. This will lead to parts of the system receiving unintended input, which may result in altered control flow, arbitrary control of a resource, or arbitrary code execution.\n\n\nInput validation is not the only technique for processing input, however. Other techniques attempt to transform potentially-dangerous input into something safe, such as filtering (CWE-790) - which attempts to remove dangerous inputs - or encoding/escaping (CWE-116), which attempts to ensure that the input is not misinterpreted when it is included in output to another component. Other techniques exist as well (see CWE-138 for more examples.)\n\n\nInput validation can be applied to:\n\n\n  - raw data - strings, numbers, parameters, file contents, etc.\n\n  - metadata - information about the raw data, such as headers or size\n\nData can be simple or structured. Structured data can be composed of many nested layers, composed of combinations of metadata and raw data, with other simple or structured data.\n\nMany properties of raw data or metadata may need to be validated upon entry into the code, such as:\n\n\n  - specified quantities such as size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, etc.\n\n  - implied or derived quantities, such as the actual size of a file instead of a specified size\n\n  - indexes, offsets, or positions into more complex data structures\n\n  - symbolic keys or other elements into hash tables, associative arrays, etc.\n\n  - well-formedness, i.e. syntactic correctness - compliance with expected syntax \n\n  - lexical token correctness - compliance with rules for what is treated as a token\n\n  - specified or derived type - the actual type of the input (or what the input appears to be)\n\n  - consistency - between individual data elements, between raw data and metadata, between references, etc.\n\n  - conformance to domain-specific rules, e.g. business logic \n\n  - equivalence - ensuring that equivalent inputs are treated the same\n\n  - authenticity, ownership, or other attestations about the input, e.g. a cryptographic signature to prove the source of the data\n\nImplied or derived properties of data must often be calculated or inferred by the code itself. Errors in deriving properties may be considered a contributing factor to improper input validation. \n\nNote that \"input validation\" has very different meanings to different people, or within different classification schemes. Caution must be used when referencing this CWE entry or mapping to it. For example, some weaknesses might involve inadvertently giving control to an attacker over an input when they should not be able to provide an input at all, but sometimes this is referred to as input validation.\n\n\nFinally, it is important to emphasize that the distinctions between input validation and output escaping are often blurred, and developers must be careful to understand the difference, including how input validation is not always sufficient to prevent vulnerabilities, especially when less stringent data types must be supported, such as free-form text. Consider a SQL injection scenario in which a person's last name is inserted into a query. The name \"O'Reilly\" would likely pass the validation step since it is a common last name in the English language. However, this valid name cannot be directly inserted into the database because it contains the \"'\" apostrophe character, which would need to be escaped or otherwise transformed. In this case, removing the apostrophe might reduce the risk of SQL injection, but it would produce incorrect behavior because the wrong name would be recorded.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2024-37032: Large language model (LLM) management tool does not validate the format of a digest value (CWE-1287) from a private, untrusted model registry, enabling relative path traversal (CWE-23), a.k.a.

Continued receipt and processing of these packets will sustain the partial DoS. The overlayd daemon handles Overlay OAM packets, such as ping and traceroute, sent to the overlay. The service runs as root by default and listens for UDP connections on port 4789. This issue results from improper buffer size validation, which can lead to a buffer overflow. Unauthenticated attackers can send specially crafted packets to trigger this vulnerability, resulting in possible remote code execution. overlayd runs by default in MX Series, ACX Series, and QFX Series platforms. The SRX Series does not support VXLAN and is therefore not vulnerable to this issue. Other platforms are also vulnerable if a Virtual Extensible LAN (VXLAN) overlay network is configured.

The implementation of `tf.raw_ops.ReverseSequence` allows for stack overflow and/or `CHECK`-fail based denial of service. The implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/5b3b071975e01f0d250c928b2a8f901cd53b90a7/tensorflow/core/kernels/reverse_sequence_op.cc#L114-L118) fails to validate that `seq_dim` and `batch_dim` arguments are valid. Negative values for `seq_dim` can result in stack overflow or `CHECK`-failure, depending on the version of Eigen code used to implement the operation. Similar behavior can be exhibited by invalid values of `batch_dim`. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2021-29610: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.

The implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/eccb7ec454e6617738554a255d77f08e60ee0808/tensorflow/core/kernels/linalg/banded_triangular_solve_op.cc#L269-L278) calls `ValidateInputTensors` for input validation but fails to validate that the two tensors are not empty. Furthermore, since `OP_REQUIRES` macro only stops execution of current function after setting `ctx->status()` to a non-OK value, callers of helper functions that use `OP_REQUIRES` must check value of `ctx->status()` before continuing. This doesn't happen in this op's implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/eccb7ec454e6617738554a255d77f08e60ee0808/tensorflow/core/kernels/linalg/banded_triangular_solve_op.cc#L219), hence the validation that is present is also not effective.

To verify if you are affected, you can try to open the following URL: `http://localhost:3000/..%2F..%2FREADME#` (replace `http://localhost:3000` with your instance's base-URL e.g. `https://demo.hedgedoc.org/..%2F..%2FREADME#`). If you see a README page being rendered, you run an affected version. The attack works due the fact that the internal router passes the url-encoded alias to the `noteController.showNote`-function. This function passes the input directly to findNote() utility function, that will pass it on the the parseNoteId()-function, that tries to make sense out of the noteId/alias and check if a note already exists and if so, if a corresponding file on disk was updated. If no note exists the note creation-function is called, which pass this unvalidated alias, with a `.md` appended, into a path.join()-function which is read from the filesystem in the follow up routine and provides the pre-filled content of the new note. This allows an attacker to not only read arbitrary `.md` files from the filesystem, but also observes changes to them. The usefulness of this attack can be considered limited, since mainly markdown files are use the file-ending `.md` and all markdown files contained in the hedgedoc project, like the README, are public anyway. If other protections such as a chroot or container or proper file permissions are in place, this attack's usefulness is rather limited. On a reverse-proxy level one can force a URL-decode, which will prevent this attack because the router will not accept such a path.\n\n- CVE-2021-43555: mySCADA myDESIGNER Versions 8.20.0 and prior fails to properly validate contents of an imported project file, which may make the product vulnerable to a path traversal payload.

Helm is a tool for managing Charts. Charts are packages of pre-configured Kubernetes resources. In Helm from version 3.0 and before version 3.5.2, there a few cases where data loaded from potentially untrusted sources was not properly sanitized. When a SemVer in the `version` field of a chart is invalid, in some cases Helm allows the string to be used \"as is\" without sanitizing. Helm fails to properly sanitized some fields present on Helm repository `index.yaml` files. Helm does not properly sanitized some fields in the `plugin.yaml` file for plugins In some cases, Helm does not properly sanitize the fields in the `Chart.yaml` file. By exploiting these attack vectors, core maintainers were able to send deceptive information to a terminal screen running the `helm` command, as well as obscure or alter information on the screen. In some cases, we could send codes that terminals used to execute higher-order logic, like clearing a terminal screen. Further, during evaluation, the Helm maintainers discovered a few other fields that were not properly sanitized when read out of repository index files. This fix remedies all such cases, and once again enforces SemVer2 policies on version fields. All users of the Helm 3 should upgrade to the fixed version 3.5.2 or later. Those who use Helm as a library should verify that they either sanitize this data on their own, or use the proper Helm API calls to sanitize the data.\n\n- CVE-2021-22331: There is a JavaScript injection vulnerability in certain Huawei smartphones.

ZyXEL NAS devices achieve authentication by using the weblogin.cgi CGI executable. This program fails to properly sanitize the username parameter that is passed to it. If the username parameter contains certain characters, it can allow command injection with the privileges of the web server that runs on the ZyXEL device. Although the web server does not run as the root user, ZyXEL devices include a setuid utility that can be leveraged to run any command with root privileges. As such, it should be assumed that exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to remote code execution with root privileges. By sending a specially-crafted HTTP POST or GET request to a vulnerable ZyXEL device, a remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on the device. This may happen by directly connecting to a device if it is directly exposed to an attacker. However, there are ways to trigger such crafted requests even if an attacker does not have direct connectivity to a vulnerable devices. For example, simply visiting a website can result in the compromise of any ZyXEL device that is reachable from the client system.

Charts are packages of pre-configured Kubernetes resources. Fuzz testing, provided by the CNCF, identified input to functions in the _strvals_ package that can cause an out of memory panic. The _strvals_ package contains a parser that turns strings in to Go structures. The _strvals_ package converts these strings into structures Go can work with. Some string inputs can cause array data structures to be created causing an out of memory panic. Applications that use the _strvals_ package in the Helm SDK to parse user supplied input can suffer a Denial of Service when that input causes a panic that cannot be recovered from. The Helm Client will panic with input to `--set`, `--set-string`, and other value setting flags that causes an out of memory panic. Helm is not a long running service so the panic will not affect future uses of the Helm client. This issue has been resolved in 3.9.4.

It has been discovered that TYPO3 CMS is susceptible to host spoofing due to improper validation of the HTTP Host header. TYPO3 uses the HTTP Host header, for example, to generate absolute URLs during the frontend rendering process. Since the host header itself is provided by the client, it can be forged to any value, even in a name-based virtual hosts environment. This vulnerability is the same as described in TYPO3-CORE-SA-2014-001 (CVE-2014-3941). A regression, introduced during TYPO3 v11 development, led to this situation. The already existing setting $GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['SYS']['trustedHostsPattern'] (used as an effective mitigation strategy in previous TYPO3 versions) was not evaluated anymore, and reintroduced the vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2021-41138: Frontier is Substrate's Ethereum compatibility layer. In the newly introduced signed Frontier-specific extrinsic for `pallet-ethereum`, a large part of transaction validation logic was only called in transaction pool validation, but not in block execution. Malicious validators can take advantage of this to put invalid transactions into a block. The attack is limited in that the signature is always validated, and the majority of the validation is done again in the subsequent `pallet-evm` execution logic. However, do note that a chain ID replay attack was possible. In addition, spamming attacks are of main concerns, while they are limited by Substrate block size limits and other factors. The issue is patched in commit `146bb48849e5393004be5c88beefe76fdf009aba`.\n\n- CVE-2021-4120: snapd 2.54.2 fails to perform sufficient validation of snap content interface and layout paths, resulting in the ability for snaps to inject arbitrary AppArmor policy rules via malformed content interface and layout declarations and hence escape strict snap confinement.

By crafting a special `GET` request containing a valid form state, a form can be submitted without invoking any validators. Form state is secured with an HMAC that is still verified. That means that this issue can only be exploited if Form Finishers cause side effects even if no form values have been sent. Form Finishers can be adjusted in a way that they only execute an action if the submitted form contains some expected data. Alternatively a custom Finisher can be added as first finisher. This regression was introduced with https://github.com/neos/form/commit/049d415295be8d4a0478ccba97dba1bb81649567\n\n- CVE-2021-26316: Failure to validate the communication buffer and communication service in the BIOS may allow an attacker to tamper with the buffer resulting in potential SMM (System Management Mode) arbitrary code execution.\n\n- CVE-2022-31041: Open Forms is an application for creating and publishing smart forms. Open Forms supports file uploads as one of the form field types. These fields can be configured to allow only certain file extensions to be uploaded by end users (e.g. only PDF / Excel / ...). The input validation of uploaded files is insufficient in versions prior to 1.0.9 and 1.1.1. Users could alter or strip file extensions to bypass this validation. This results in files being uploaded to the server that are of a different file type than indicated by the file name extension. These files may be downloaded (manually or automatically) by staff and/or other applications for further processing. Malicious files can therefore find their way into internal/trusted networks. Versions 1.0.9 and 1.1.1 contain patches for this issue. As a workaround, an API gateway or intrusion detection solution in front of open-forms may be able to scan for and block malicious content before it reaches the Open Forms application.\n\n- CVE-2022-29206: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning.

By using special elements such as \"..\" and \"/\" separators, attackers can escape outside of the restricted location to access files or directories that are elsewhere on the system. One of the most common special elements is the \"../\" sequence, which in most modern operating systems is interpreted as the parent directory of the current location. This is referred to as relative path traversal. Path traversal also covers the use of absolute pathnames such as \"/usr/local/bin\" to access unexpected files. This is referred to as absolute path traversal.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2024-37032: Large language model (LLM) management tool does not validate the format of a digest value (CWE-1287) from a private, untrusted model registry, enabling relative path traversal (CWE-23), a.k.a.

A path traversal vulnerability exists in versions prior to 15.3.18, 15.5.3, and 16.0.0. Using a specially prepared ZIP file, it is possible to overwrite any file that is writable by the application server user (e.g. the tomcat user). Depending on the configuration this can be limited to files of the OpenOlat user data directory, however, if not properly set up, the attack could also be used to overwrite application server config files, java code or even operating system files. The attack could be used to corrupt or modify any OpenOlat file such as course structures, config files or temporary test data. Those attack would require in-depth knowledge of the installation and thus more theoretical. If the app server configuration allows the execution of jsp files and the path to the context is known, it is also possible to execute java code. If the app server runs with the same user that is used to deploy the OpenOlat code or has write permissions on the OpenOlat code files and the path to the context is know, code injection is possible. The attack requires an OpenOlat user account to upload a ZIP file and trigger the unzip method. It can not be exploited by unregistered users. The problem is fixed in versions 15.3.18, 15.5.3 and 16.0.0. There are no known workarounds aside from upgrading.\n\n- CVE-2020-19146: Improper Access Control in Jfinal CMS v4.7.1 and earlier allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via the 'TemplatePath' parameter in the component 'jfinal_cms/admin/folder/list'.\n\n- CVE-2020-19147: Improper Access Control in Jfinal CMS v4.7.1 and earlier allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive infromation via the 'getFolder()' function in the component '/modules/filemanager/FileManager.java'.\n\n- CVE-2020-26806: admin/file.do in ObjectPlanet Opinio before 7.15 allows Unrestricted File Upload of executable JSP files, resulting in remote code execution, because filePath can have directory traversal and fileContent can be valid JSP code.\n\n- CVE-2021-20034: An improper access control vulnerability in SMA100 allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to bypass the path traversal checks and delete an arbitrary file potentially resulting in a reboot to factory default settings.\n\n- CVE-2021-23428: This affects all versions of package elFinder.NetCore.

The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input validation of URLs in HTTP requests processed by an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request containing directory traversal character sequences to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view arbitrary files within the web services file system on the targeted device. The web services file system is enabled when the affected device is configured with either WebVPN or AnyConnect features. This vulnerability cannot be used to obtain access to ASA or FTD system files or underlying operating system (OS) files.\n\n- CVE-2020-11652: An issue was discovered in SaltStack Salt before 2019.2.4 and 3000 before 3000.2. The salt-master process ClearFuncs class allows access to some methods that improperly sanitize paths. These methods allow arbitrary directory access to authenticated users.\n\n- CVE-2020-1631: A vulnerability in the HTTP/HTTPS service used by J-Web, Web Authentication, Dynamic-VPN (DVPN), Firewall Authentication Pass-Through with Web-Redirect, and Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP) allows an unauthenticated attacker to perform local file inclusion (LFI) or path traversal. Using this vulnerability, an attacker may be able to inject commands into the httpd.log, read files with 'world' readable permission file or obtain J-Web session tokens. In the case of command injection, as the HTTP service runs as user 'nobody', the impact of this command injection is limited. (CVSS score 5.3, vector CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N) In the case of reading files with 'world' readable permission, in Junos OS 19.3R1 and above, the unauthenticated attacker would be able to read the configuration file. (CVSS score 5.9, vector CVSS:3.1/ AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N) If J-Web is enabled, the attacker could gain the same level of access of anyone actively logged into J-Web. If an administrator is logged in, the attacker could gain administrator access to J-Web. (CVSS score 8.8, vector CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) This issue only affects Juniper Networks Junos OS devices with HTTP/HTTPS services enabled. Junos OS devices with HTTP/HTTPS services disabled are not affected. If HTTP/HTTPS services are enabled, the following command will show the httpd processes: user@device> show system processes | match http 5260 - S 0:00.13 /usr/sbin/httpd-gk -N 5797 - I 0:00.10 /usr/sbin/httpd --config /jail/var/etc/httpd.conf To summarize: If HTTP/HTTPS services are disabled, there is no impact from this vulnerability. If HTTP/HTTPS services are enabled and J-Web is not in use, this vulnerability has a CVSS score of 5.9 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N). If J-Web is enabled, this vulnerability has a CVSS score of 8.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H). Juniper SIRT has received a single report of this vulnerability being exploited in the wild. Out of an abundance of caution, we are notifying customers so they can take appropriate actions. Indicators of Compromise: The /var/log/httpd.log may have indicators that commands have injected or files being accessed. The device administrator can look for these indicators by searching for the string patterns \"=*;*&\" or \"*%3b*&\" in /var/log/httpd.log, using the following command: user@device> show log httpd.log | match \"=*;*&|=*%3b*&\" If this command returns any output, it might be an indication of malicious attempts or simply scanning activities. Rotated logs should also be reviewed, using the following command: user@device> show log httpd.log.0.gz | match \"=*;*&|=*%3b*&\" user@device> show log httpd.log.1.gz | match \"=*;*&|=*%3b*&\" Note that a skilled attacker would likely remove these entries from the local log file, thus effectively eliminating any reliable signature that the device had been attacked. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS 12.3 versions prior to 12.3R12-S16; 12.3X48 versions prior to 12.3X48-D101, 12.3X48-D105; 14.1X53 versions prior to 14.1X53-D54; 15.1 versions prior to 15.1R7-S7; 15.1X49 versions prior to 15.1X49-D211, 15.1X49-D220; 16.1 versions prior to 16.1R7-S8; 17.2 versions prior to 17.2R3-S4; 17.3 versions prior to 17.3R3-S8; 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R2-S11, 17.4R3-S2; 18.1 versions prior to 18.1R3-S10; 18.2 versions prior to 18.2R2-S7, 18.2R3-S4; 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R2-S4, 18.3R3-S2; 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R1-S7, 18.4R3-S2 ; 18.4 version 18.4R2 and later versions; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R1-S5, 19.1R3-S1; 19.1 version 19.1R2 and later versions; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R2; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R2-S3, 19.3R3; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R1-S2, 19.4R2; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R1-S1, 20.1R2.\n\n- CVE-2020-4430: IBM Data Risk Manager 2.0.1, 2.0.2, 2.0.3, and 2.0.4 could allow a remote authenticated attacker to traverse directories on the system.

Argo CD starting with version 1.3.0 but before versions 2.1.11, 2.2.6, and 2.3.0 is vulnerable to a path traversal bug, compounded by an improper access control bug, allowing a malicious user with read-only repository access to leak sensitive files from Argo CD's repo-server. A malicious Argo CD user who has been granted `get` access for a repository containing a Helm chart can craft an API request to the `/api/v1/repositories/{repo_url}/appdetails` endpoint to leak the contents of out-of-bounds files from the repo-server. The malicious payload would reference an out-of-bounds file, and the contents of that file would be returned as part of the response. Contents from a non-YAML file may be returned as part of an error message. The attacker would have to know or guess the location of the target file. Sensitive files which could be leaked include files from other Applications' source repositories or any secrets which have been mounted as files on the repo-server. This vulnerability is patched in Argo CD versions 2.1.11, 2.2.6, and 2.3.0. The patches prevent path traversal and limit access to users who either A) have been granted Application `create` privileges or B) have been granted Application `get` privileges and are requesting details for a `repo_url` that has already been used for the given Application. There are currently no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-27925: Zimbra Collaboration (aka ZCS) 8.8.15 and 9.0 has mboximport functionality that receives a ZIP archive and extracts files from it.

For this reason, the most effective way to discuss these weaknesses is to note the distinct features which classify them as injection weaknesses. The most important issue to note is that all injection problems share one thing in common -- i.e., they allow for the injection of control plane data into the user-controlled data plane. This means that the execution of the process may be altered by sending code in through legitimate data channels, using no other mechanism. While buffer overflows, and many other flaws, involve the use of some further issue to gain execution, injection problems need only for the data to be parsed. The most classic instantiations of this category of weakness are SQL injection and format string vulnerabilities.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2023-29374: Math component in an LLM framework translates user input into a Python expression that is input into the Python exec() method, allowing code execution - one variant of a \"prompt injection\" attack.\n\n- CVE-2024-5565: Python-based library uses an LLM prompt containing user input to dynamically generate code that is then fed as input into the Python exec() method, allowing code execution - one variant of a \"prompt injection\" attack.\n\n- CVE-2024-4181: Framework for LLM applications allows eval injection via a crafted response from a hosting provider.\n\n- CVE-2022-2054: Python compiler uses eval() to execute malicious strings as Python code.\n\n- CVE-2021-22204: Chain: regex in EXIF processor code does not correctly determine where a string ends (CWE-625), enabling eval injection (CWE-95), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2020-8218: \"Code injection\" in VPN product, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2008-5071: Eval injection in PHP program.\n\n- CVE-2002-1750: Eval injection in Perl program.\n\n- CVE-2008-5305: Eval injection in Perl program using an ID that should only contain hyphens and numbers.\n\n- CVE-2002-1752: Direct code injection into Perl eval function.\n\n- CVE-2002-1753: Eval injection in Perl program.\n\n- CVE-2005-1527: Direct code injection into Perl eval function.\n\n- CVE-2005-2837: Direct code injection into Perl eval function.\n\n- CVE-2005-1921: MFV. code injection into PHP eval statement using nested constructs that should not be nested.\n\n- CVE-2005-2498: MFV. code injection into PHP eval statement using nested constructs that should not be nested.\n\n- CVE-2005-3302: Code injection into Python eval statement from a field in a formatted file.\n\n- CVE-2007-1253: Eval injection in Python program.\n\n- CVE-2001-1471: chain: Resultant eval injection.

It does so by using dynamically generated Groovy classes. A user able to control job parameters can run arbitrary code on OneDev's server by injecting arbitrary Groovy code. The ultimate result is in the injection of a static constructor that will run arbitrary code. For a full example refer to the referenced GHSA. This issue was addressed in 4.0.3 by escaping special characters such as quote from user input.\n\n- CVE-2021-21277: angular-expressions is \"angular's nicest part extracted as a standalone module for the browser and node\". In angular-expressions before version 1.1.2 there is a vulnerability which allows Remote Code Execution if you call \"expressions.compile(userControlledInput)\" where \"userControlledInput\" is text that comes from user input. The security of the package could be bypassed by using a more complex payload, using a \".constructor.constructor\" technique. In terms of impact: If running angular-expressions in the browser, an attacker could run any browser script when the application code calls expressions.compile(userControlledInput). If running angular-expressions on the server, an attacker could run any Javascript expression, thus gaining Remote Code Execution.

In version 3.6.0, if a user received a malicious file share and has it synced locally or the virtual filesystem enabled and clicked a nc://open/ link it will open the default editor for the file type of the shared file, which on Windows can also sometimes mean that a file depending on the type, e.g. \"vbs\", is being executed. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Desktop client is upgraded to version 3.6.1. As a workaround, users can block the Nextcloud Desktop client 3.6.0 by setting the `minimum.supported.desktop.version` system config to `3.6.1` on the server, so new files designed to use this attack vector are not downloaded anymore. Already existing files can still be used. Another workaround would be to enforce shares to be accepted by setting the `sharing.force_share_accept` system config to `true` on the server, so new files designed to use this attack vector are not downloaded anymore. Already existing shares can still be abused.\n\n- CVE-2022-38078: Movable Type XMLRPC API provided by Six Apart Ltd. contains a command injection vulnerability. Sending a specially crafted message by POST method to Movable Type XMLRPC API may allow arbitrary Perl script execution, and an arbitrary OS command may be executed through it.

The specific exploit requires the application to run on Tomcat as a WAR deployment. If the application is deployed as a Spring Boot executable jar, i.e. the default, it is not vulnerable to the exploit. However, the nature of the vulnerability is more general, and there may be other ways to exploit it.\n\n- CVE-2022-29171: Sourcegraph is a fast and featureful code search and navigation engine. Versions before 3.38.0 are vulnerable to Remote Code Execution in the gitserver service. The Gitolite code host integration with Phabricator allows Sourcegraph site admins to specify a `callsignCommand`, which is used to obtain the Phabricator metadata for a Gitolite repository. An administrator who is able to edit or add a Gitolite code host and has administrative access to Sourcegraph\u2019s bundled Grafana instance can change this command arbitrarily and run it remotely. This grants direct access to the infrastructure underlying the Sourcegraph installation. The attack requires: site-admin privileges on the instance of Sourcegraph, Administrative privileges on the bundled Grafana monitoring instance, Knowledge of the gitserver IP address or DNS name (if running in Kubernetes). This can be found through Grafana. The issue is patched in version 3.38.0. You may disable Gitolite code hosts. We still highly encourage upgrading regardless of workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2021-27446: The Weintek cMT product line is vulnerable to code injection, which may allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute commands with root privileges on the operation system.\n\n- CVE-2021-39908: In all versions of GitLab CE/EE starting from 0.8.0 before 14.2.6, all versions starting from 14.3 before 14.3.4, and all versions starting from 14.4 before 14.4.1 certain Unicode characters can be abused to commit malicious code into projects without being noticed in merge request or source code viewer UI.\n\n- CVE-2022-1159: Rockwell Automation Studio 5000 Logix Designer (all versions) are vulnerable when an attacker who achieves administrator access on a workstation running Studio 5000 Logix Designer could inject controller code undetectable to a user.\n\n- CVE-2022-21831: A code injection vulnerability exists in the Active Storage >= v5.2.0 that could allow an attacker to execute code via image_processing arguments.\n\n- CVE-2022-22285: A vulnerability using PendingIntent in Reminder prior to version 12.2.05.0 in Android R(11.0) and 12.3.02.1000 in Android S(12.0) allows attackers to execute privileged action by hijacking and modifying the intent.\n\n- CVE-2022-22286: A vulnerability using PendingIntent in Bixby Routines prior to version 3.1.21.8 in Android R(11.0) and 2.6.30.5 in Android Q(10.0) allows attackers to execute privileged action by hijacking and modifying the intent.\n\n- CVE-2022-23120: A code injection vulnerability in Trend Micro Deep Security and Cloud One - Workload Security Agent for Linux version 20 and below could allow an attacker to escalate privileges and run arbitrary code in the context of root. Please note: an attacker must first obtain access to the target agent in an un-activated and unconfigured state in order to exploit this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2022-23503: TYPO3 is an open source PHP based web content management system. Versions prior to 8.7.49, 9.5.38, 10.4.33, 11.5.20, and 12.1.1 are vulnerable to Code Injection. Due to the lack of separating user-submitted data from the internal configuration in the Form Designer backend module, it is possible to inject code instructions to be processed and executed via TypoScript as PHP code. The existence of individual TypoScript instructions for a particular form item and a valid backend user account with access to the form module are needed to exploit this vulnerability. This issue is patched in versions 8.7.49 ELTS, 9.5.38 ELTS, 10.4.33, 11.5.20, 12.1.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-24663: PHP Everywhere <= 2.0.3 included functionality that allowed execution of PHP Code Snippets via WordPress shortcodes, which can be used by any authenticated user.\n\n- CVE-2022-24735: Redis is an in-memory database that persists on disk. By exploiting weaknesses in the Lua script execution environment, an attacker with access to Redis prior to version 7.0.0 or 6.2.7 can inject Lua code that will execute with the (potentially higher) privileges of another Redis user. The Lua script execution environment in Redis provides some measures that prevent a script from creating side effects that persist and can affect the execution of the same, or different script, at a later time. Several weaknesses of these measures have been publicly known for a long time, but they had no security impact as the Redis security model did not endorse the concept of users or privileges. With the introduction of ACLs in Redis 6.0, these weaknesses can be exploited by a less privileged users to inject Lua code that will execute at a later time, when a privileged user executes a Lua script. The problem is fixed in Redis versions 7.0.0 and 6.2.7. An additional workaround to mitigate this problem without patching the redis-server executable, if Lua scripting is not being used, is to block access to `SCRIPT LOAD` and `EVAL` commands using ACL rules.\n\n- CVE-2022-24817: Flux2 is an open and extensible continuous delivery solution for Kubernetes. Flux2 versions between 0.1.0 and 0.29.0, helm-controller 0.1.0 to v0.19.0, and kustomize-controller 0.1.0 to v0.23.0 are vulnerable to Code Injection via malicious Kubeconfig. In multi-tenancy deployments this can also lead to privilege escalation if the controller's service account has elevated permissions. Workarounds include disabling functionality via Validating Admission webhooks by restricting users from setting the `spec.kubeConfig` field in Flux `Kustomization` and `HelmRelease` objects. Additional mitigations include applying restrictive AppArmor and SELinux profiles on the controller\u2019s pod to limit what binaries can be executed. This vulnerability is fixed in kustomize-controller v0.23.0 and helm-controller v0.19.0, both included in flux2 v0.29.0\n\n- CVE-2022-29813: In JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA before 2022.1 local code execution via custom Pandoc path was possible\n\n- CVE-2022-29814: In JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA before 2022.1 local code execution via HTML descriptions in custom JSON schemas was possible\n\n- CVE-2022-29815: In JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA before 2022.1 local code execution via workspace settings was possible\n\n- CVE-2022-29819: In JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA before 2022.1 local code execution via links in Quick Documentation was possible\n\n- CVE-2022-29821: In JetBrains Rider before 2022.1 local code execution via links in ReSharper Quick Documentation was possible\n\n- CVE-2022-30083: EllieGrid Android Application version 3.4.1 is vulnerable to Code Injection.

Other pre-existing weaknesses can turn into security vulnerabilities if they occur while operating at raised privileges.\n\n\nPrivilege management functions can behave in some less-than-obvious ways, and they have different quirks on different platforms. These inconsistencies are particularly pronounced if you are transitioning from one non-root user to another. Signal handlers and spawned processes run at the privilege of the owning process, so if a process is running as root when a signal fires or a sub-process is executed, the signal handler or sub-process will operate with root privileges.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2007-4217: FTP client program on a certain OS runs with setuid privileges and has a buffer overflow. Most clients do not need extra privileges, so an overflow is not a vulnerability for those clients.\n\n- CVE-2008-1877: Program runs with privileges and calls another program with the same privileges, which allows read of arbitrary files.\n\n- CVE-2007-5159: OS incorrectly installs a program with setuid privileges, allowing users to gain privileges.\n\n- CVE-2008-4638: Composite: application running with high privileges (CWE-250) allows user to specify a restricted file to process, which generates a parsing error that leaks the contents of the file (CWE-209).\n\n- CVE-2008-0162: Program does not drop privileges before calling another program, allowing code execution.\n\n- CVE-2008-0368: setuid root program allows creation of arbitrary files through command line argument.\n\n- CVE-2007-3931: Installation script installs some programs as setuid when they shouldn't be.\n\n- CVE-2020-3812: mail program runs as root but does not drop its privileges before attempting to access a file. Attacker can use a symlink from their home directory to a directory only readable by root, then determine whether the file exists based on the response.\n\n- CVE-2003-0908: Product launches Help functionality while running with raised privileges, allowing command execution using Windows message to access \"open file\" dialog.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-8793: OpenSMTPD before 6.6.4 allows local users to read arbitrary files (e.g., on some Linux distributions) because of a combination of an untrusted search path in makemap.c and race conditions in the offline functionality in smtpd.c.\n\n- CVE-2021-1675: Windows Print Spooler Remote Code Execution Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-0204: A sensitive information disclosure vulnerability in delta-export configuration utility (dexp) of Juniper Networks Junos OS may allow a locally authenticated shell user the ability to create and read database files generated by the dexp utility, including password hashes of local users.

          "extended_description": "\n\nInput validation is a frequently-used technique for checking potentially dangerous inputs in order to ensure that the inputs are safe for processing within the code, or when communicating with other components. When software does not validate input properly, an attacker is able to craft the input in a form that is not expected by the rest of the application. This will lead to parts of the system receiving unintended input, which may result in altered control flow, arbitrary control of a resource, or arbitrary code execution.\n\n\nInput validation is not the only technique for processing input, however. Other techniques attempt to transform potentially-dangerous input into something safe, such as filtering (CWE-790) - which attempts to remove dangerous inputs - or encoding/escaping (CWE-116), which attempts to ensure that the input is not misinterpreted when it is included in output to another component. Other techniques exist as well (see CWE-138 for more examples.)\n\n\nInput validation can be applied to:\n\n\n  - raw data - strings, numbers, parameters, file contents, etc.\n\n  - metadata - information about the raw data, such as headers or size\n\nData can be simple or structured. Structured data can be composed of many nested layers, composed of combinations of metadata and raw data, with other simple or structured data.\n\nMany properties of raw data or metadata may need to be validated upon entry into the code, such as:\n\n\n  - specified quantities such as size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, etc.\n\n  - implied or derived quantities, such as the actual size of a file instead of a specified size\n\n  - indexes, offsets, or positions into more complex data structures\n\n  - symbolic keys or other elements into hash tables, associative arrays, etc.\n\n  - well-formedness, i.e. syntactic correctness - compliance with expected syntax \n\n  - lexical token correctness - compliance with rules for what is treated as a token\n\n  - specified or derived type - the actual type of the input (or what the input appears to be)\n\n  - consistency - between individual data elements, between raw data and metadata, between references, etc.\n\n  - conformance to domain-specific rules, e.g. business logic \n\n  - equivalence - ensuring that equivalent inputs are treated the same\n\n  - authenticity, ownership, or other attestations about the input, e.g. a cryptographic signature to prove the source of the data\n\nImplied or derived properties of data must often be calculated or inferred by the code itself. Errors in deriving properties may be considered a contributing factor to improper input validation. \n\nNote that \"input validation\" has very different meanings to different people, or within different classification schemes. Caution must be used when referencing this CWE entry or mapping to it. For example, some weaknesses might involve inadvertently giving control to an attacker over an input when they should not be able to provide an input at all, but sometimes this is referred to as input validation.\n\n\nFinally, it is important to emphasize that the distinctions between input validation and output escaping are often blurred, and developers must be careful to understand the difference, including how input validation is not always sufficient to prevent vulnerabilities, especially when less stringent data types must be supported, such as free-form text. Consider a SQL injection scenario in which a person's last name is inserted into a query. The name \"O'Reilly\" would likely pass the validation step since it is a common last name in the English language. However, this valid name cannot be directly inserted into the database because it contains the \"'\" apostrophe character, which would need to be escaped or otherwise transformed. In this case, removing the apostrophe might reduce the risk of SQL injection, but it would produce incorrect behavior because the wrong name would be recorded.\n",

It is the lack of verification of these assumptions for user-controlled input that leads to injection problems. Injection problems encompass a wide variety of issues -- all mitigated in very different ways and usually attempted in order to alter the control flow of the process. For this reason, the most effective way to discuss these weaknesses is to note the distinct features that classify them as injection weaknesses. The most important issue to note is that all injection problems share one thing in common -- i.e., they allow for the injection of control plane data into the user-controlled data plane. This means that the execution of the process may be altered by sending code in through legitimate data channels, using no other mechanism. While buffer overflows, and many other flaws, involve the use of some further issue to gain execution, injection problems need only for the data to be parsed.",

          "extended_description": "\n\nThis weakness can lead to a vulnerability in environments in which the attacker does not have direct access to the operating system, such as in web applications. Alternately, if the weakness occurs in a privileged program, it could allow the attacker to specify commands that normally would not be accessible, or to call alternate commands with privileges that the attacker does not have. The problem is exacerbated if the compromised process does not follow the principle of least privilege, because the attacker-controlled commands may run with special system privileges that increases the amount of damage.\n\n\nThere are at least two subtypes of OS command injection:\n\n\n  - The application intends to execute a single, fixed program that is under its own control. It intends to use externally-supplied inputs as arguments to that program. For example, the program might use system(\"nslookup [HOSTNAME]\") to run nslookup and allow the user to supply a HOSTNAME, which is used as an argument. Attackers cannot prevent nslookup from executing. However, if the program does not remove command separators from the HOSTNAME argument, attackers could place the separators into the arguments, which allows them to execute their own program after nslookup has finished executing.\n\n  - The application accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run, as well as which commands to use. The application simply redirects this entire command to the operating system. For example, the program might use \"exec([COMMAND])\" to execute the [COMMAND] that was supplied by the user. If the COMMAND is under attacker control, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or programs. If the command is being executed using functions like exec() and CreateProcess(), the attacker might not be able to combine multiple commands together in the same line.\n\nFrom a weakness standpoint, these variants represent distinct programmer errors. In the first variant, the programmer clearly intends that input from untrusted parties will be part of the arguments in the command to be executed. In the second variant, the programmer does not intend for the command to be accessible to any untrusted party, but the programmer probably has not accounted for alternate ways in which malicious attackers can provide input.",
