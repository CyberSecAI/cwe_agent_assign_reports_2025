The crux of the issue is that hfsc is assuming that checking for cl->qdisc->q.qlen == 0 guarantees that it hasnt inserted the class in the vttree or eltree (which is not true for the netem duplicate case). This patch checks the n_active class variable to make sure that the code wont insert the class in the vttree or eltree twice, catering for the reentrant case.
