    "enhanced_query": "# Vulnerability Description\n\n    The Contact Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to **missing file type validation** in the contact form upload feature in all versions up to, and including, 8.6.4. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected sites server which may make remote code execution possible in specific configurations where the first extension is processed over the final. This vulnerability also requires successfully exploiting a **race condition** in order to exploit.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'missing file type validation'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1.

CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements (Score: 492.93)\n\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component....\n\n## ROOTCAUSE: 'race condition'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1.
