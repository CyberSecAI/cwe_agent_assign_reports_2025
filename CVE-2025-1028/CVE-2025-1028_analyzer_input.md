# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-1028

# Vulnerability Description

    The Contact Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to **missing file type validation** in the contact form upload feature in all versions up to, and including, 8.6.4. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected sites server which may make remote code execution possible in specific configurations where the first extension is processed over the final. This vulnerability also requires successfully exploiting a **race condition** in order to exploit.
