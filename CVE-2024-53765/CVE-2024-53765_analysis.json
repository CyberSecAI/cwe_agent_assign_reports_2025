The specific impact varies case by case.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\nThe vulnerability is exploitable through CSRF attacks.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\nThe attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into performing an action. Unauthenticated users can initiate the attack, targeting authenticated users.",

Because there is no CSRF protection, an attacker can trick a user into performing actions they did not intend to, such as submitting malicious input. This leads to Stored **XSS** (CWE-79) because the application does not properly neutralize the user-controllable input before placing it in the output.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states the presence of a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability that leads to Stored **XSS**. The primary root cause is the **lack of CSRF protection**, which is best represented by CWE-352. The **XSS** vulnerability is a secondary weakness resulting from the **lack of input neutralization**, mapped to CWE-79.\n\nThe evidence for CWE-352 is the explicit mention of \"Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability\" and the **lack of CSRF protection**.\n\nThe evidence for CWE-79 is the presence of \"Stored **XSS**\" and the description implying that the application doesn't neutralize user input, which is then displayed on a web page.\n\nCWE-80 (Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)) was considered, but CWE-79 is a more general and appropriate fit since the description doesn't specify the neutralization failure to be specific to HTML tags.\n\nCWE-116 (Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output) was considered, but CWE-79 is a better fit because the core issue is the improper neutralization of input before being placed in a web page, not necessarily a general encoding/escaping problem.",
