Affected by this issue is the function cgi_audio_search/cgi_create_playlist/cgi_get_album_all_tracks/cgi_get_alltracks_editlist/cgi_get_artist_all_album/cgi_get_genre_all_tracks/cgi_get_tracks_list/cgi_set_airplay_content/cgi_write_playlist of the file /cgi-bin/myMusic.cgi. The manipulation leads to **command injection**. The attack may be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. NOTE This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer. NOTE Vendor was contacted early and confirmed that the product is end-of-life. It should be retired and replaced.",

  "reference_content": "The provided content relates to command injection vulnerabilities affecting D-Link NAS devices. Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:\n\n**CVE-2024-7922** is not mentioned in the provided text. However, the content describes a command injection vulnerability affecting D-Link NAS devices, specifically the DNS-320/320L/321/323/325/327L models, which may be related to this CVE.\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n- The vulnerability stems from a command injection flaw in the `cgi_create_playlist` function within the `/cgi-bin/myMusic.cgi` file.\n- The `artist` variable, passed via a POST request, is used in a `sprintf` function to construct a command, which is then executed by the `system` command.\n- The `SpecSymbol2BackSlash` function, intended to sanitize special characters, fails to do so, enabling command execution through crafted input.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- Command injection vulnerability in the `myMusic.cgi` file, specifically in the handling of the `artist` parameter within the `cgi_create_playlist` function.\n- Insufficient input sanitization. The `SpecSymbol2BackSlash` function fails to prevent the execution of arbitrary commands.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- Remote attackers can execute arbitrary system commands on the affected devices.\n- This could lead to complete device compromise, including data theft, malware installation, denial of service, and other malicious activities.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- The vulnerability is exploitable through a specially crafted POST request to the `/cgi-bin/myMusic.cgi` endpoint.\n- The attacker needs to include malicious commands within the `artist` parameter of the POST request.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the vulnerable device.\n- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.\n- The attacker needs to know the vulnerable endpoint and parameters.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The D-Link security advisory (SAP10383) confirms that several D-Link NAS devices, including those listed above, are affected by command injection vulnerabilities. It attributes one such vulnerability to the \"BuaaIOTTeam\", which also published the technical details about `/cgi-bin/myMusic.cgi`.\n- These devices have reached their End of Life (EOL)/End of Service Life (EOS) and D-Link is no longer providing security patches or support.\n- D-Link recommends that users retire and replace these devices.\n- The VulDB entry [275108] is likely related to this vulnerability and mentions `/cgi-bin/myMusic.cgi`.\n\nThe provided content gives more specific information than the CVE description placeholder, detailing the vulnerable file and function, the attack vector, and impact. It also confirms the affected models and their end-of-life status.",

The key phrase \"**command injection**\" in the Vulnerability Description and the description of the `cgi_create_playlist` function being vulnerable to command injection due to insufficient sanitization solidify this assessment. The Retriever Results also strongly support CWE-78 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')) as the primary CWE.
