## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE Content

This content **relates** to a potential vulnerability, but it's a report *about* a vulnerability, not the CVE description itself. It details a SQL injection vulnerability in the "Sales and Inventory System V1.0" by campcodes. It provides more detail than a typical CVE description would.

Here's a breakdown of the extracted information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient user input validation of the 'cid' parameter in the `/pages/cash_transaction.php` file. The application directly uses the 'cid' parameter in SQL queries without proper sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   SQL Injection

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Unauthorized database access
*   Sensitive data leakage
*   Data tampering
*   Comprehensive system control
*   Service interruption

**Attack vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is exploitable via the 'cid' parameter in a POST request to `/pages/cash_transaction.php`.
*   No login or authorization is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to send a crafted POST request to the vulnerable endpoint. No authentication is required.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   **Use prepared statements and parameter binding:** This separates SQL code from user input.
*   **Input validation and filtering:**  Strictly validate and filter user input.
*   **Minimize database user permissions:** Use accounts with the least necessary privileges.
*   **Regular security audits:** Conduct regular code and system security audits.

**Payload Examples (provided for exploitation):**

*   Boolean-based blind SQL injection payload
*   Error-based SQL injection payload
*   Time-based blind SQL injection payload

The content also includes screenshots demonstrating the use of `sqlmap` to identify databases.
