  "query": "A vulnerability was found in GNU Binutils 2.43. It has been rated as critical. Affected by this issue is the function bfd_putl64 of the file bfd/libbfd.c of the component ld. The manipulation leads to memory corruption. The attack may be launched remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation is known to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. Upgrading to version 2.44 is able to address this issue. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component. The code maintainer explains, that [t]his bug has been fixed at some point between the 2.43 and 2.44 releases.",
