## Vulnerability Description
An **integer overflow** in Nethermind Juno before v.12.05 within the Sierra bytecode decompression logic within the cairo-lang-starknet-classes library could allow remote attackers to trigger an infinite loop (and high CPU usage) by submitting a malicious Declare v2/v3 transaction. This results in a denial-of-service condition for affected Starknet full-node implementations.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **integer overflow**
- **impact:** denial of service and high CPU usage and infinite loop
- **vector:** malicious Declare v2/v3 transaction
- **attacker:** remote attackers
- **product:** Nethermind Juno
- **version:** before v.12.05
- **component:** Sierra bytecode decompression logic within the cairo-lang-starknet-classes library

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-29072 related content

Here's an analysis of the provided content, focusing on information relevant to CVE-2025-29072 (PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval).

**1. Community Forum Post (community.starknet.io)**

This content *is* relevant. It details a potential full node vulnerability in Starknet discovered by Guanxing Wen of CertiK.

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Integer overflow in the Sierra bytecode decompression logic of Cairo classes when handling v2 or v3 Declare transactions.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of proper overflow checks in full node implementations.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Full CPU saturation of affected nodes, potentially leading to shutdowns, service stalls, or halting interaction between nodes and Dapps.
*   **Attack vectors:** Crafting a malicious Declare transaction with a carefully chosen overflow value.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Ability to create and submit malicious Declare transactions to the network. No specific privileges are required.
*   **Mitigation or fix:** Implementing strict overflow settings and additional guardrails around integer handling in full node implementations. Updated build instructions were disseminated to node operators.
*   **More detail than CVE description:** Yes, this provides a detailed technical explanation of the vulnerability, timeline of events, and mitigation steps.

**2. GitHub Commit (github.com)**

This content *is* relevant. It shows a commit to the Juno project (a Starknet client) that addresses a compilation error related to overflow checks.

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The commit enables `overflow-checks` in the release profile of the `Cargo.toml` file. This addresses the integer overflow issue described in the community forum post.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of overflow checks during compilation.
*   **Impact of exploitation:**  The commit aims to prevent the integer overflow vulnerability that could lead to CPU saturation.
*   **Attack vectors:**  The same as described in the community forum post - malicious Declare transactions.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Same as above.
*   **Mitigation or fix:** Enabling `overflow-checks` during compilation.
*   **More detail than CVE description:** Yes, this provides the specific code change made to address the vulnerability. The commit message explicitly links to the related issue (#2297) and mentions the fix for the Starknet compilation error.

**Summary:**

Both sources describe the same vulnerability: an integer overflow in Starknet full nodes that could be exploited by malicious Declare transactions. The community forum post provides a high-level overview, while the GitHub commit shows the specific code change made to mitigate the issue.
