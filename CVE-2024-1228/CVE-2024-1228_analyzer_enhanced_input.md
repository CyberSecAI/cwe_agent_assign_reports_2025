## Vulnerability Description
Use of **hard-coded password** to the patients database allows an attacker to retrieve sensitive data stored in the database. The password is the same among all Eurosoft Przychodnia installations. This issue affects Eurosoft Przychodnia software before version 20240417.001 (from that version vulnerability is fixed).

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **hard-coded password**
- **impact:** retrieve sensitive data
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** Eurosoft Przychodnia
- **version:** before 20240417.001
- **component:** patients database

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-1228

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of a hard-coded, identical password across all installations of the Eurosoft Przychodnia software. This shared password provides unauthorized access to the patient database.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials:** The primary weakness is the presence of a hard-coded password within the software, making it easily discoverable and exploitable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Data Exposure:** An attacker can gain access to sensitive patient data stored in the database, potentially leading to privacy violations and data breaches.
- **Unauthorized Access:** The hard-coded credentials allow unauthorized access to the application's database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by connecting to the database from a network, including the public internet.
- **Direct Database Access:** The hard-coded password allows direct access to the database if the attacker has the ability to make a connection to the database server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** An attacker needs network access to the database server. This could be through a compromised network, a public-facing database server, or by being on the internal network where the server is located.
- **Database Connection Knowledge:** An attacker needs to know how to connect to the database server being used by the software, but no software specific knowledge is needed outside of the database type and connection string.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects Eurosoft Przychodnia software versions prior to 20240417.001. Version 20240417.001 contains the fix.
- The same vulnerability (use of hardcoded credentials) was found in other medical software products:
   - drEryk Gabinet (CVE-2024-3699)
   - Simple Care (CVE-2024-3700)
- CERT Polska recommends that database access be restricted to local or private network connections (VPN) with multi-factor authentication, and that software vendors implement mechanisms that require users to set a strong password during initial configuration.
