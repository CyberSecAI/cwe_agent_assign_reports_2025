The root cause is that files and directories are accessible when they should not be.|\n| CWE-200 | Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor | 0.8 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary. The impact is exposure of sensitive information |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship influencing the decision is that CWE-552 (Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties) directly leads to CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor). CWE-552 is the root cause, while CWE-200 is the impact. The abstraction levels (Base and Class, respectively) are appropriate.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe552[\"CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe200 -->|RESULT| cwe552\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe552 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **files and directories being accessible to external parties** (CWE-552), which then leads to the **exposure of sensitive information to unauthorized actors** (CWE-200).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis strongly supports the selection of CWE-552 as the primary weakness, with CWE-200 as a secondary impact. The evidence clearly indicates that the Awesome Support WordPress plugin allows unauthorized access to files and directories, resulting in the exposure of sensitive data.\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to extract sensitive data stored insecurely in the /wp-content/uploads/awesome-support directory which can contain file attachments included in support tickets.\" This directly supports CWE-552 because the rootcause is the files and directories are accessible when they should not be. It supports CWE-200 because the impact is **sensitive information exposure**.\n\nThe graph relationships reinforced the understanding that allowing unauthorized access to files (CWE-552) leads to the exposure of sensitive information (CWE-200). The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-552 being a Base-level weakness and CWE-200 being a Class-level impact.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25
