## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## CVE-2025-2374 Analysis - Relevant Content Found

The following information is extracted from the provided content, relating to a SQL injection vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The `mobilenumber` parameter in `profile.php` is not filtered, allowing direct execution of time-based SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   SQL Injection

**Impact of exploitation:**

The impact is not explicitly stated, but SQL injection vulnerabilities can lead to data breaches, modification, or deletion, and potentially compromise the entire database.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is exploitable through the `mobilenumber` parameter in the `profile.php` file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to submit a crafted input to the `mobilenumber` parameter. This likely requires access to the profile editing functionality.

**Mitigation or fix:**

1.  **Use prepared statements and parameter binding:** This separates SQL code from user input.
2.  **Input validation and filtering:** Strictly validate and filter user input to ensure it conforms to the expected format.
3.  **Regular security audits:** Conduct regular code and system security audits.
