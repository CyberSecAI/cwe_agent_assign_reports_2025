  "description": "A vulnerability was found in code-projects Simple Car Rental System 1.0. It has been classified as critical. Affected is an unknown function of the file /book_car.php. The manipulation of the argument fname/id_no/gender/email/phone/location leads to **sql injection**. It is possible to launch the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The initial researcher advisory only mentions the parameter fname to be affected. Further analysis indicates that other arguments might be affected as well.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-11632\n\n**Vulnerability Description:**\nThe provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the `book_car.php` file of the \"Simple Car Rental System In PHP With Source Code\" project.\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization or validation of the `fname` parameter in the `book_car.php` file. This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code into the parameter, which is then directly used in SQL queries without being properly escaped or parameterized.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, where user-supplied input is not sanitized, allowing attackers to manipulate database queries.\n- **Lack of Input Validation:** The application fails to validate and sanitize the `fname` parameter, making it vulnerable to injection attacks.\n- **Direct Use of User Input in SQL Queries:** The application directly incorporates user-provided data into SQL queries without employing prepared statements or parameter binding.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Unauthorized Database Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database.\n- **Sensitive Data Leakage:** Attackers can retrieve sensitive information stored in the database.\n- **Data Tampering:** Attackers can modify or delete data in the database.\n- **Comprehensive System Control:** In severe cases, attackers might be able to gain control over the entire system.\n- **Service Interruption:** Attackers can disrupt the normal operation of the application or even cause a denial of service.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is exploited through an HTTP POST request to the `book_car.php` file.\n- **`fname` Parameter:** The attack vector is the `fname` parameter in the POST request, where malicious SQL code is injected.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server hosting the vulnerable application.\n- **Understanding of SQL:** A basic understanding of SQL syntax is required to craft the malicious SQL injection payloads.\n- **Ability to Send HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the server with the malicious payload.\n- **No Login Required:** The vulnerability is accessible without requiring login credentials.\n\n**Technical Details:**\n- The vulnerability is time-based blind SQL injection.\n- The provided payload `fname=123' AND (SELECT 3129 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))kxLQ) AND 'esew'='esew` demonstrates a time-based injection using `SLEEP(5)`.\n- The attacker can extract database information using `sqlmap`\n\n**Suggested Repair:**\n1. **Use Prepared Statements and Parameter Binding:** This prevents SQL injection by treating user input as data and not SQL code.\n2. **Input Validation and Filtering:** Implement strict validation and filtering of user inputs to ensure they match expected formats.\n3. **Minimize Database User Permissions:** Use database accounts with only necessary permissions for the application.\n4. **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits to identify and fix potential vulnerabilities.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The vulnerable system is \"Simple Car Rental System In PHP With Source Code\" version 1.0.\n- The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a POST request to the `book_car.php` file with a crafted `fname` parameter.",

The vulnerability description clearly states the presence of SQL injection due to the **improper neutralization** of input. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship influencing the decision is the direct match between the vulnerability description and CWE-89, which represents the root cause of the issue. While other CWEs like CWE-79 (Cross-Site Scripting) and CWE-113 (HTTP Request/Response Splitting) were considered due to their presence in the retriever results and graph relationships, they do not accurately represent the core vulnerability described, which is specifically SQL Injection.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe113[\"CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\"]\n\n    cwe89 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe79 -->|PEEROF| cwe89\n    cwe113 -->|PEEROF| cwe89\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe89 primary\n    class cwe74,cwe78,cwe79,cwe113 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward:\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Improper neutralization** of special elements in SQL commands (CWE-89) due to **lack of input validation**.\n2.  **Impact:** The potential for unauthorized database access, sensitive data leakage, data tampering, and comprehensive system control.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is primarily based on the provided evidence, which clearly indicates an **SQL injection** vulnerability. The vulnerability description key phrases and the CVE reference links content summary both point to CWE-89 as the most appropriate classification.\n\nThe evidence includes the vulnerability description stating \"**sql injection**\" due to manipulation of arguments, and the CVE reference links content summary stating the **root cause** as the **lack of proper sanitization** of the `fname` parameter, leading to the ability to inject malicious SQL code.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the consideration of other CWEs, but the direct match and clear evidence supporting CWE-89 outweighed these considerations.\n\nCWE-89 is selected as the optimal level of specificity because it accurately describes the weakness at its root cause.
