  "query": "A vulnerability was found in code-projects Simple Car Rental System 1.0. It has been classified as critical. Affected is an unknown function of the file /book_car.php. The manipulation of the argument fname/id_no/gender/email/phone/location leads to sql injection. It is possible to launch the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The initial researcher advisory only mentions the parameter fname to be affected. Further analysis indicates that other arguments might be affected as well.",
