## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-11632

**Vulnerability Description:**
The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the `book_car.php` file of the "Simple Car Rental System In PHP With Source Code" project.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization or validation of the `fname` parameter in the `book_car.php` file. This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code into the parameter, which is then directly used in SQL queries without being properly escaped or parameterized.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, where user-supplied input is not sanitized, allowing attackers to manipulate database queries.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The application fails to validate and sanitize the `fname` parameter, making it vulnerable to injection attacks.
- **Direct Use of User Input in SQL Queries:** The application directly incorporates user-provided data into SQL queries without employing prepared statements or parameter binding.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Database Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database.
- **Sensitive Data Leakage:** Attackers can retrieve sensitive information stored in the database.
- **Data Tampering:** Attackers can modify or delete data in the database.
- **Comprehensive System Control:** In severe cases, attackers might be able to gain control over the entire system.
- **Service Interruption:** Attackers can disrupt the normal operation of the application or even cause a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is exploited through an HTTP POST request to the `book_car.php` file.
- **`fname` Parameter:** The attack vector is the `fname` parameter in the POST request, where malicious SQL code is injected.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
- **Understanding of SQL:** A basic understanding of SQL syntax is required to craft the malicious SQL injection payloads.
- **Ability to Send HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the server with the malicious payload.
- **No Login Required:** The vulnerability is accessible without requiring login credentials.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is time-based blind SQL injection.
- The provided payload `fname=123' AND (SELECT 3129 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))kxLQ) AND 'esew'='esew` demonstrates a time-based injection using `SLEEP(5)`.
- The attacker can extract database information using `sqlmap`

**Suggested Repair:**
1. **Use Prepared Statements and Parameter Binding:** This prevents SQL injection by treating user input as data and not SQL code.
2. **Input Validation and Filtering:** Implement strict validation and filtering of user inputs to ensure they match expected formats.
3. **Minimize Database User Permissions:** Use database accounts with only necessary permissions for the application.
4. **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits to identify and fix potential vulnerabilities.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerable system is "Simple Car Rental System In PHP With Source Code" version 1.0.
- The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a POST request to the `book_car.php` file with a crafted `fname` parameter.
