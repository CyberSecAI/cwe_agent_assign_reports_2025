The Retriever Results also suggest other Class and Base level CWEs such as CWE-771, CWE-119, CWE-444, and CWE-471. Since CWE-400 is a class level, it may have more specific Base-level children that would be more appropriate.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe400 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an unspecified flaw that leads to **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption**, resulting in a Denial of Service.\n  - Unspecified Flaw --> CWE-400 --> Denial of Service\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nBased on the provided information, the vulnerability is classified as CWE-400 (**Uncontrolled Resource Consumption**). The primary evidence for this classification is the statement \"Denial of Service\" which can be achieved when there is **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption**.
