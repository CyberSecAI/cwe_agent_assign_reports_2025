Since the sound card drivers probe happens before the card registration, accessing any of the members of a dummy component during probe will result in undefined behavior. This can be observed in the mt8188 and mt8195 machine sound drivers. By omitting a dai link subnode in the sound cards node in the Devicetree, the default uninitialized dummy codec is used, and when its dai_name pointer gets passed to strcmp() it results in a null pointer dereference and a kernel panic. In addition to that, set_card_codec_info() in the generic helpers file, mtk-soundcard-driver.c, will populate a dai link with a dummy codec when a dai link node is present in DT but with no codec property. The result is that at probe time, a dummy codec can either be uninitialized with num_codecs = 0, or be an initialized dummy codec, with num_codecs = 1 and dai_name = snd-soc-dummy-dai. In order to accommodate for both situations, check that num_codecs is not zero before accessing the codecs fields but still check for the codecs dai name against snd-soc-dummy-dai as needed. While at it, also drop the check that dai_name is not null in the mt8192 driver, introduced in commit 4d4e1b6319e5 (ASoC mediatek mt8192 Check existence of dai_name before dereferencing), as it is actually redundant given the preceding num_codecs != 0 check.",
