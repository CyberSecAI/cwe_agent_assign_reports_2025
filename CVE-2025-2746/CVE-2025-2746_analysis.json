  "reference_content": "Here's an analysis of the content, focusing on the provided CVE description:\n\n**1. Does the content relate to the CVE specified based on the official description?**\n\nBased on the provided content from `labs.watchtowr.com_e6758cec_20250624_165838.html` and `github.com_7fcee159_20250624_165837.html`, the content directly relates to a **Kentico Xperience CMS Staging Service Authentication Bypass**, making it potentially relevant, even though a CVE isn't yet assigned.  Specifically, the article details vulnerabilities identified by WatchTowr Labs that lead to authentication bypass and subsequent remote code execution.\n\n**2. If the content does not relate to this CVE, respond with \"UNRELATED\"**\n\nNOINFO\n\n**3. If no useful vulnerability information is found, respond with \"NOINFO\"**\n\nNOINFO\n\n**4. For relevant content, extract it if exists**\n\nThe content describes and analyzes vulnerabilities (WT-2025-0006, WT-2025-0011, and WT-2025-0007) in the Kentico Xperience CMS Staging Service. While a specific CVE ID isn't assigned in the content, the article outlines the details of authentication bypasses, a post-authentication RCE, and a path traversal vulnerability, which directly align with the potential impact of a vulnerability.\n\n*   **Root cause of vulnerability:**\n    *   WT-2025-0006: The `AuthenticateToken` method in the `WebServiceAuthorization` class returns an empty string for an invalid username, allowing bypass.\n    *   WT-2025-0011: A logical flaw in the obsolete Microsoft Web Service Enhancement 3.0 library (WSE3) leads to authentication bypass when the `Password` tag is omitted, and the `_passwordOption` remains as `SendNone`.\n    *   WT-2025-0007: Path traversal vulnerability within the `CheckAndEnsureFilePath` method when creating a new media file upload. Specifically `librarySubFolderPath` isn\u2019t verified against path traversal sequences.\n\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n    *   Authentication bypass in the Kentico Xperience CMS Staging Service (WT-2025-0006 and WT-2025-0011).\n    *   Post-authentication Remote Code Execution (WT-2025-0007) via path traversal.\n\n*   **Impact of exploitation:**\n    *   Full administrative access to the Kentico Xperience CMS.\n    *   Remote Code Execution, leading to complete system compromise.\n\n*   **Attack vectors:**\n    *   Exploiting the Staging Service API.\n    *   Crafting malicious SOAP requests to bypass authentication (WT-2025-0006 & WT-2025-0011).\n    *   Uploading a webshell via path traversal using the media file upload functionality (WT-2025-0007).\n\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n    *   Network access to the target Kentico Xperience CMS instance.\n    *   The Staging Service must be enabled and configured with username/password authentication.\n    *   For WT-2025-0011 (versions 13.0.173 to 13.0.177), knowledge of a valid Staging Service username is required.\n\n*   **Mitigation or fix:**\n    *   WT-2025-0006: Fixed in Kentico Xperience 13.0.173 by throwing an exception when an invalid username is provided.\n    *   WT-2025-0011 & WT-2025-0007: Fixed in Kentico Xperience 13.0.178 (details not given).\n    *   The article recommends not using the obsolete Microsoft Web Services Enhancement 3.0 for anything.\n\n**More Detail than Official CVE Description:** The content provides significantly more detail than a typical CVE description. It includes:\n\n*   Detailed technical analysis of the vulnerabilities.\n*   Code snippets.\n*   Proof-of-concept (PoC) request examples (SOAP requests).\n*   Attack flow.\n*   Timeline of the disclosure and patching process.",

The vulnerability description indicates that the **password handling of empty SHA1 usernames** is the root cause.\n\nBased on the Retriever Results and Complete CWE Specifications, CWE-288 \"Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel\" is the best fit because the Staging Sync Server is providing an alternate path that does not require authentication due to the **password handling of empty SHA1 usernames**. This matches the description of CWE-288.\n\nCWE-306 \"Missing Authentication for Critical Function\" was considered because there is an **authentication bypass vulnerability** due to the Staging Sync Server **password handling of empty SHA1 usernames**. However, the description says that there is a failure in password handling, which implies that authentication was expected.\n\nCWE-289 \"Authentication Bypass by Alternate Name\" was considered but the root cause is not due to an alternate name.\n\nThe selection of CWE-288 is at the optimal level of specificity because it is a Base CWE and accurately describes the **authentication bypass vulnerability** due to the Staging Sync Server **password handling of empty SHA1 usernames**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product requires authentication, but the product has an alternate path or channel that does not require authentication.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-204: Observable Response Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product provides different responses to incoming requests in a way that reveals internal state information to an unauthorized actor outside of the intended control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
