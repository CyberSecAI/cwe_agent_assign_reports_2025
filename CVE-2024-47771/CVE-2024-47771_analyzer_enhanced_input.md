## Vulnerability Description
Element Desktop is a Matrix client for desktop platforms. Element Desktop versions 1.11.70 through 1.11.80 contain a vulnerability which can, under specially crafted conditions, lead to the access token becoming exposed to third parties. At least one vector has been identified internally, involving malicious widgets, but other vectors may exist. Users are strongly advised to upgrade to version 1.11.81 to remediate the issue. As a workaround, avoid granting permissions to untrusted widgets.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** access token exposed to third parties
- **vector:** malicious widgets
- **product:** Element Desktop
- **version:** 1.11.70 through 1.11.80

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-47771:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how Element Desktop handles authenticated media requests. Specifically, it involves how access tokens are passed when accessing media, potentially exposing them to third parties under specific conditions. The core issue lies in how the application rewrites URLs and adds authorization headers for media requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Access Token Exposure:** The primary weakness is the potential for access tokens to be exposed to malicious third parties. The mechanism for rewriting media URLs and attaching authorization headers was flawed.
- **Insecure Media URL Handling:** The application modifies media URLs late in the request lifecycle (similar to a service worker), which is insecure and error-prone.
- **Insufficient Origin Validation:** There was insufficient validation of the origin of requests to ensure they were indeed going to the legitimate homeserver.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Access Token Theft:** Attackers could gain access to a user's access token, enabling them to impersonate the user and perform actions on their account.
- **Data Exposure:** With access to a user's token, attackers could potentially access private conversations and data associated with the user's account.
- **Account Compromise:** Complete account compromise is possible depending on the scope of the exposed token.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Widgets:** The vulnerability can be exploited via malicious widgets, which can be crafted to trigger the conditions necessary for token exposure.
- **Other Potential Vectors:** The description notes that while malicious widgets are one identified vector, "other vectors may exist", suggesting the possibility of other attack methods.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Create Malicious Widgets:** Attackers must have the ability to create or inject malicious widgets into the Element Desktop client.
- **User Interaction:** The user needs to interact with or grant permission to the malicious widget.
- **Network Position:** The attacker does not need to be on the same network, this is a network based attack vector.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Element Desktop versions 1.11.70 through 1.11.80.
*   The issue is fixed in version 1.11.81.
*   The fix involves moving the check for the homeserver URL to where the access token is added, doing IPC communication sparingly to reduce the chance of token leaks and ensuring the origin of request matches the homeserver instead of relying solely on hostname.

* The fix includes the following changes to `media-auth.ts`:
   -  Checking the request URL before modification
   - Ensuring the origin matches the homeserver origin rather than only checking hostname
   - Moving the `getHomeserverUrl` check to before the Authorization header is added
   - Adding `try...catch` blocks when creating URL objects

* The fix includes the following changes to `preload.ts`:
    - Adding the `serverSupportedVersions` to the list of electron channels.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* 🔍 *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* 🔍 *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion – CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### 🔸 CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ✅ *“A user created with the ‘guest’ role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ✅ *“The backup service runs as root but only needs read access.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ⚠️ This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### 🔸 CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ✅ *“User can access another user’s invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.”*

## Mapping Examples – Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *“User can escalate privileges to admin.”*
> ❌ Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged – only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ✅ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**

| “Unauthorized read/write to file”           | Permission control issue              | CWE-285                                      |
| “Can access resource without correct role”  | Incorrect or missing permission check | CWE-285, 862, 863                            |

## Good Mapping Examples – Privileges & Permissions

* ✅ **CWE-266**: *“When a new user registers, the system assigns them admin role due to a missing role validation.”*
* ✅ **CWE-250**: *“Installer runs with system-level privileges but doesn't require them to install files in the user directory.”*
* ✅ **CWE-284**: *“Inconsistent access rules between UI and backend for sensitive endpoints.”*
* ✅ **CWE-285**: *“Authorization logic fails to restrict access to finance reports based on department.”*
