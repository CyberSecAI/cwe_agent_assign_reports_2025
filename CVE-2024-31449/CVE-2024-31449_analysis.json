CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) can precede CWE-119. CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) is a broad weakness class, but is appropriate here to represent the **improper handling of edge cases** that led to the overflow.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe121[\"CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    cwe190[\"CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n\n    cwe121 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe190 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe119\n    cwe121 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe20\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe121 primary\n    class cwe119,cwe190,cwe20 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper handling of edge cases (specifically INT_MIN)**, potentially involving an **integer overflow**, leading to a **stack buffer overflow**, which ultimately results in the potential for **remote code execution**.\n\n`Improper handling of INT_MIN -> Integer Overflow (Potential) -> Stack Buffer Overflow -> Remote Code Execution`\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe primary vulnerability is a **stack buffer overflow** (CWE-121) in the bit library of Redis. The root cause is due to the function not properly handling the `INT_MIN` value. The **improper handling of edge cases** can be generalized to **improper input validation** (CWE-20). The integer overflow (CWE-190) may be an intermediate step in the vulnerability chain, although the description focuses more on the final buffer overflow. The evidence provided clearly points to a stack buffer overflow due to an edge case in the input, therefore CWE-121 is the most specific and appropriate primary mapping.\n\nThe selection is based on the following evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE Reference Links Content Summary:\n\n*   \"Redis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk. An authenticated user may use a specially crafted Lua script to trigger a **stack buffer overflow** in the bit library, which may potentially lead to remote code execution.\"\n*   \"**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by a **stack buffer overflow** in the `bit.tohex` function of the Lua bit library used in Redis.
