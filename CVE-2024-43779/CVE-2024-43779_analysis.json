Here's a breakdown:\n\n*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Disabled vault items remain visible through the ClearML API, although they are hidden in the web app.\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information disclosure. Authenticated users can retrieve disabled vault items.\n*   **Impact of exploitation:** Sensitive credentials or other information could be leaked.\n*   **Attack vectors:** A specially crafted HTTP GET request to the API endpoint https://app.clearml.[somedomain.com]/api/v2.30/users.get\\_vaults.\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An authenticated ClearML user.\n*   **Mitigation or fix:** Modify the API to exclude disabled global vault items from the response.\n*   **More detail than the official CVE description:** Yes, the content provides specific details on the API endpoint, the impact, and a proof of concept.",

Specifically, CWE-200 is a class-level CWE, while CWE-497 and CWE-201 are base-level CWEs. Given the specificity of the vulnerability description, choosing a base-level CWE is preferable, but the evidence supporting CWE-497 and CWE-201 is weaker than CWE-200, making CWE-200 the primary candidate.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe497[\"CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    \n    cwe497 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe201 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe497,cwe201 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **failure to properly restrict access to disabled vault items**, leading to **information disclosure**.

The vulnerability allows authenticated users to retrieve disabled vault items through a specially crafted HTTP request, potentially leaking sensitive credentials.\n\nCWE-200 is a Class-level CWE, and while it is generally better to choose a Base-level CWE, the evidence provided supports this classification more strongly than the other, more specific, CWEs.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-200 is commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error.
