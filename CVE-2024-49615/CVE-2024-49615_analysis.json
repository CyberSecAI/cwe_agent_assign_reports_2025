The specific impact will depend on the actions available within the plugin.\n- **Attack vectors:** The attack is performed by crafting a malicious request and tricking an authenticated user into sending it.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious page. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.",

This is triggered via **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** (CWE-352) due to the **lack of CSRF protection**. The CSRF (CWE-352) allows an attacker to trick a user into unintentionally triggering the **SQL Injection** (CWE-89). CWE-352 can precede CWE-89 in this context.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    \n    cwe352 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe89\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe89 primary\n    class cwe352 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the **lack of CSRF protection**, leading to a CSRF vulnerability.
