# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-497 | Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere | 0.8 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-200 | Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor | 0.6 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7
*   **Evidence Strength:** LOW

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE selected is CWE-497, which is a Base level CWE. CWE-200 is a Class-level CWE and a parent of CWE-497. The vulnerability description describes **inclusion of sensitive information in source code**, which aligns well with CWE-497.mermaid

## Vulnerability Chain
The chain of events is as follows:
1.  **Root Cause:** CWE-497 (Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere) due to **inclusion of sensitive information in source code**.
2.  Impact: Sensitive information is accessible to unauthorized actors.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis considered CWE-200 due to the phrase "inclusion of sensitive information". However, upon closer inspection, CWE-497, "Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere", is a more precise Base level CWE that better captures the essence of the vulnerability. The vulnerability description explicitly states **inclusion of sensitive information in source code**, making it available to unauthorized users who can view the source code. Since the CVE Reference Links Content Summary is "UNRELATED" there is not much additional evidence to go on.
