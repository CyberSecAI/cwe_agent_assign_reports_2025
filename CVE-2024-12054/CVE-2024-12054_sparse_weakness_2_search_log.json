  "query": "ZF Roll Stability Support Plus (RSSPlus) is vulnerable to an authentication bypass vulnerability targeting deterministic RSSPlus SecurityAccess service seeds, which may allow an attacker to remotely (proximal/adjacent with RF equipment or via pivot from J2497 telematics devices) call diagnostic functions intended for workshop or repair scenarios. This can impact system availability, potentially degrading performance or erasing software, however the vehicle remains in a safe vehicle state.",
