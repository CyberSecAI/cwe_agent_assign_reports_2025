  "description": "Gradio is an open-source Python package designed for quick prototyping. This vulnerability is related to ****CORS origin validation****, where the **Gradio server fails to validate the request origin when a cookie is present**. This allows an attackers website to make unauthorized requests to a local Gradio server. Potentially, attackers can upload files, steal authentication tokens, and access user data if the victim visits a malicious website while logged into Gradio. This impacts users who have deployed Gradio locally and use basic authentication. Users are advised to upgrade to `gradio>4.44` to address this issue. As a workaround, users can manually enforce stricter **CORS origin validation** by modifying the `CustomCORSMiddleware` class in their local Gradio server code. Specifically, they can bypass the condition that skips CORS validation for requests containing cookies to prevent potential exploitation.",

Several potential child CWEs such as CWE-942, CWE-1385, and CWE-784 were considered. CWE-942 and CWE-1385 are both variants and are peers, while CWE-784 is more related to cookies specifically. Since the core issue is a general origin validation problem, CWE-346 serves as the best high-level representation.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe346[\"CWE-346: Origin Validation Error\"]\n    cwe942[\"CWE-942: Permissive Cross-domain Policy with Untrusted Domains\"]\n    cwe1385[\"CWE-1385: Missing Origin Validation in WebSockets\"]\n    cwe784[\"CWE-784: Reliance on Cookies without Validation and Integrity Checking in a Security Decision\"]\n    \n    cwe942 -->|CHILDOF| cwe346\n    cwe1385 -->|CHILDOF| cwe346\n    cwe784 -->|CHILDOF| cwe346\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe346 primary\n    class cwe942,cwe1385,cwe784 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **Gradio server failing to validate the request origin when a cookie is present**. This **missing origin validation** allows attackers to bypass CORS protections. This leads to the impact of attackers being able to upload files, steal authentication tokens, and access user data.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe primary weakness is that the Gradio server **fails to validate the request origin when a cookie is present**. This is a **CORS origin validation** issue. The vulnerability description and CVE summary both highlight this **missing validation** as the root cause.\n\nCWE-346 (Origin Validation Error) is a Class-level CWE that generally describes the problem.\nThe vulnerability description states \"**Gradio server fails to validate the request origin when a cookie is present**\".\nCWE-346 description: \"The product does not properly verify that the source of data or communication is valid.\"\n\nCWE-942 (Permissive Cross-domain Policy with Untrusted Domains) is a Variant-level CWE that describes the weakness of having untrusted domains.\nThe vulnerability description states \"attackers website to make unauthorized requests to a local Gradio server\".\nCWE-942 description: \"The product implements a cross-domain policy that is too permissive, allowing untrusted domains to interact with the product in unexpected or dangerous ways.\"\n\nCWE-1385 (Missing Origin Validation in WebSockets) is a Variant-level CWE.\nThe vulnerability description states \"Gradio server fails to validate the request origin when a cookie is present\".\nCWE-1385 description: \"The web server does not validate the origin of WebSocket requests.\"\n\nCWE-784 (Reliance on Cookies without Validation and Integrity Checking in a Security Decision) is a Variant-level CWE.\nThe vulnerability description states \"**Gradio server fails to validate the request origin when a cookie is present**\".\nCWE-784 description: \"The product uses the existence of a cookie to make a security decision, but it does not validate or check the integrity of the cookie.\"\n\nThe selection is based on the provided evidence. CWE-346 is the most appropriate because the root cause is related to \"**CORS origin validation**, where the **Gradio server fails to validate the request origin when a cookie is present**\". The other CWE's are either too specific or do not exactly match the vulnerability description.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-346: Origin Validation Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly verify that the source of data or communication is valid.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-451: User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe user interface (UI) does not properly represent critical information to the user, allowing the information - or its source - to be obscured or spoofed.
