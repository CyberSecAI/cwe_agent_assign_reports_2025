This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Trimble SketchUp Pro. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of PSD files embedded in SKP files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.

Specifically, the issue occurs during the parsing process of PSD data.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\\n\\n*   **Out-of-bounds read:** The lack of validation allows an attacker to craft a malicious PSD file that, when parsed, causes the software to read past the end of an allocated buffer. This is a memory corruption issue.\\n\\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\\n\\n*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary impact is the disclosure of sensitive information from the application's memory.\\n*   **Potential for further exploitation:** The advisory mentions that this out-of-bounds read vulnerability can be used in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to achieve arbitrary code execution in the context of the current process.\\n\\n**Attack Vectors:**\\n\\n*   **Malicious SKP file:** An attacker can embed a specially crafted PSD file within an SKP file.\\n*   **User Interaction:** The user must open the malicious SKP file in Trimble SketchUp Pro for the vulnerability to be triggered.\\n\\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\\n\\n*   The attacker needs the ability to create a malicious SKP file with a specially crafted PSD embedded within it.\\n*   The attacker relies on the victim opening the malicious file, indicating a requirement for user interaction.\\n\\n**Additional Notes:**\\n* The vulnerability is fixed in SketchUp version 24.0.553\\n* The CVSS score is 3.3 with vector string AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N, indicating low impact and exploitability.\", similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {}, 'top_cwes_by_threshold': {}}},

    "enhanced_query": "# Vulnerability Description\n\n    Trimble SketchUp Pro SKP File Parsing **Out-Of-Bounds Read** **Information Disclosure Vulnerability**. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Trimble SketchUp Pro. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of PSD files embedded in SKP files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.
