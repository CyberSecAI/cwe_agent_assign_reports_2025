CWE-863 is a more specific type of improper authorization, where an authorization check is performed, but incorrectly. The description indicates that the authorization of LTE NAS messages is **incorrect**, leading to the vulnerability. Therefore, CWE-863 is a more precise classification than its parent, CWE-285. CWE-306 was also considered, but the vulnerability seems to be related to incorrect authorization rather than missing authentication.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe285 -->|PEEROF| cwe306\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe285,cwe306 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **incorrect authorization** of LTE NAS messages (CWE-863). This leads to the impact of downgrading to lower network generations and repeated DDOS attacks.\n\nCWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) -> Impact: Downgrading to lower network generations and repeated DDOS.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis considered CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) because the vulnerability description mentions \"**incorrect authorization of LTE NAS messages**\". However, after further review and considering the CWE specifications, CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) was selected as the primary CWE. This is because CWE-863 is a more specific child of CWE-285, indicating that an authorization check is performed, but it is done incorrectly. This aligns with the description, which states that the authorization is **incorrect**.\n\nThe CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) was also considered, but it was ruled out because the vulnerability is related to authorization rather than authentication.\n\nThe final decision to use CWE-863 was based on the evidence that the authorization check is present but **incorrect**, leading to the vulnerability. CWE-863 is at the Class level of abstraction, which is appropriate for this vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly anticipate or handle exceptional conditions that rarely occur during normal operation of the product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.\n\n\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
