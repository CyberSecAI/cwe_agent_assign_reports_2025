# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-27159

## Vulnerability Description
All the Toshiba printers contain a shell script using the same hardcoded key to encrypt logs. An attacker can decrypt the encrypted files using the hardcoded key. This vulnerability can be executed in combination with other vulnerabilities and difficult to execute alone. So, the CVSS score for this vulnerability alone is lower than the score listed in the Base Score of this vulnerability.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2024-27159:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content directly mentions CVE-2024-27159 as a vulnerability related to a hardcoded password used to encrypt logs. This aligns with the CVE description (PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval), where the vulnerability involves a hardcoded password.

**2. Extracted Information:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
    *   A hardcoded key (`1048toshibatec`) is used within a shell script (`/home/SYSROM_SRC/build/common/bin/encrypt_backup_log.sh`) for encrypting logs.
    *   Another script (`/home/SYSROM_SRC/build/common/bin/CreateDebugLog.sh`) uses this same hardcoded key and a weak MD5 digest cipher for log encryption.
    *   Python applications like `alreportmanager` and `alusermgr` also use `1048toshibatec` to encrypt files.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Hardcoded cryptographic key:** The use of the same hardcoded key across all devices creates a single point of failure.
    *   **Weak Cipher:** The usage of MD5 as the digest cipher makes the encryption weak.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker can decrypt encrypted log files or other encrypted files using the hardcoded key. This may lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, such as configuration data, credentials, or other potentially valuable data stored in the logs.

*  **Attack Vectors:**
     *   An attacker needs to have access to the encrypted log or file to decrypt it.
     *    Attackers can use other vulnerabilities, such as the file upload flaws or remote code execution, to gain access to the device and obtain the encrypted data.

*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
     *   The attacker needs to have the ability to access the file system of the affected devices to obtain the encrypted data. This can be achieved via exploiting other vulnerabilities (like path traversal, remote code execution).

**Additional Details:**
   *  The content provides specific file paths and scripts, which is more detailed than a typical CVE description. It also mentions the usage of `openssl` for encryption, and weak MD5 cipher.

   * The content provides context about how these files can be accessed through multiple vulnerabilities, and also mentions that this hardcoded password has been in use for several years.

**Summary:**

CVE-2024-27159 refers to the use of a hardcoded password in Toshiba Multi-Function Printers used for encrypting logs, allowing attackers to decrypt them and potentially expose sensitive data. It also notes usage of a weak hashing algorithm for key derivation, which contributes to the weakness.
