This affects the function setParentalRules of the file /cgi-bin/cstecgi.cgi. The manipulation of the argument desc leads to buffer overflow. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",
