  "query": "An Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the routing protocol daemon (rpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows a logically adjacent downstream RSVP neighbor to cause kernel memory exhaustion, leading to a kernel crash, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). The kernel memory leak and eventual crash will be seen when the downstream RSVP neighbor has a persistent error which will not be corrected.
