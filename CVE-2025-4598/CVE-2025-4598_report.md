# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2025-4598

## Description

A vulnerability was found in systemd-coredump. This flaw allows an attacker to force a SUID process to crash and replace it with a non-SUID binary to access the originals privileged process coredump, allowing the attacker to read sensitive data, such as /etc/shadow content, loaded by the original process. A SUID binary or process has a special type of permission, which allows the process to run with the file owners permissions, regardless of the user executing the binary. This allows the process to access more restricted data than unprivileged users or processes would be able to. An attacker can leverage this flaw by forcing a SUID process to crash and force the Linux kernel to recycle the process PID before systemd-coredump can analyze the /proc/pid/auxv file. If the attacker wins the **race condition**, they gain access to the originals SUID process coredump file. They can read sensitive content loaded into memory by the original binary, affecting data confidentiality.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-367 | Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition | 0.9 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-267 | Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions | 0.5 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-367, which is a Base level CWE that describes a TOCTOU race condition. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions a **race condition** where the state of a resource changes between the check and use, which aligns with CWE-367. The secondary CWE is CWE-267, which relates to privileges being used to perform unsafe actions. In this case, the SUID privilege allows the vulnerable process to access restricted data.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with a **race condition** (CWE-367) in systemd-coredump. This race occurs when an attacker can replace a crashed SUID process with a non-SUID process before systemd-coredump analyzes the /proc/pid/auxv file. If the attacker wins the race, they gain unauthorized access to the original SUID process's coredump file, leading to the exposure of sensitive data (e.g., /etc/shadow content). The vulnerability exploits a **privilege** (CWE-267) associated with SUID processes to access restricted data.

## Summary of Analysis
The primary assessment is based on the evidence that a **race condition** is present in the systemd-coredump utility. The vulnerability description and the CVE reference summary clearly state that a **race condition** allows a local attacker to crash a SUID program and gain read access to the resulting core dump. The Qualys Security Advisory provides detailed analysis and specifically mentions the **lack of protection against the "kill-and-replace" attack**.

The initial analysis considered CWE-362, as it is a Class-level CWE for general race conditions. However, CWE-367 is more specific, as it describes a time-of-check time-of-use race condition, which aligns more closely with the vulnerability description. Additionally, CWE-367 is a Base level CWE, which is preferred over Class level CWEs.

The graph relationships influenced the final selection by showing the parent-child relationship between CWE-362 and CWE-367. While CWE-362 is a broader category, CWE-367 provides a more precise characterization of the race condition.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-367 directly addresses the TOCTOU **race condition**, and CWE-267 highlights the role of privileges in enabling the vulnerability.

Relevant CWE Information:

**CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition**

The product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check. This can cause the product to perform invalid actions when the resource is in an unexpected state.

**CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions**

A particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.
