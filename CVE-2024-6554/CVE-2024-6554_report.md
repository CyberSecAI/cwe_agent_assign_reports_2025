# Analysis Report for CVE-2024-6554

# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-6554

## Description

The Branda - White Label WordPress, Custom Login Page Customizer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Full Path Disclosure in all versions up to, and including, 3.4.18. This is due the plugin utilizing composer without preventing direct access to the files. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve the full path of the web application, which can be used to aid other attacks. The information displayed is not useful on its own, and requires another vulnerability to be present for damage to an affected website.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Impact:** Full Path Disclosure
- **Attacker:** unauthenticated attackers
- **Product:** Branda - White Label WordPress
- **Version:** up to and including 3.4.18
- **Component:** Custom Login Page Customizer plugin

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-200 | Exposure of Sensitive Information | 1.0 | Class | Primary | Allowed-with-Review |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary identified CWE is CWE-200 [Exposure of Sensitive Information]. Given that the vulnerability specifically involves the disclosure of the full path, a more specific CWE might have been considered but was not in the provided list. Therefore, CWE-200 is the most appropriate given the details of the vulnerability. It is a Class level CWE, and there might be more specific Base level CWEs, however, they were not provided.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **root cause** of using composer without restricting direct access to the files. This leads to the **weakness** of Full Path Disclosure, and the potential **impact** of aiding other attacks.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis identified the vulnerability as Full Path Disclosure, stemming from **improper** access control to composer files, leading to exposure of sensitive path information.

The selection of CWE-200 [Exposure of Sensitive Information] is based on the fact that the vulnerability description clearly states that the plugin exposes the full server path of the web application. The exposed information, while not directly exploitable on its own, can aid other attacks, which aligns with the description of CWE-200. While there might be more specific CWEs, the provided information supports CWE-200 as the most relevant. The confidence is high because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions "Full Path Disclosure" and the reference link summary explains how direct file access leads to revealing the full server path.
