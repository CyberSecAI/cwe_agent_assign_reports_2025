## Vulnerability Description
toy-blog is a headless content management system implementation. Starting in version 0.4.3 and prior to version 0.5.0, the **administrative password was leaked** through the command line parameter. The problem was patched in version 0.5.0. As a workaround, pass `--read-bearer-token-from-stdin` to the launch arguments and feed the token from the standard input in version 0.4.14 or later. Earlier versions do not have this workaround.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **administrative password was leaked**
- **product:** toy-blog
- **version:** Starting in version 0.4.3 and prior to version 0.5.0

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2024-39314:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The administrative token (bearer token) was being passed as a command-line parameter. This exposed the token to local users who could potentially view the command-line arguments through process listings or shell history.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Exposure of Sensitive Information (CWE-214):** Passing the administrative token as a command-line argument made it visible to local users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker could gain access to the administrative token, allowing them to potentially modify or delete blog content, depending on the functionality associated with the token.
*  **Integrity Breach:** By obtaining the administrative token, the attacker can modify or delete the blog content, leading to a loss of integrity.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable by users who have local access to the system running the vulnerable application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have local access to the system where the application is running.
*   The attacker needs the ability to view command-line parameters (e.g., through process lists or command history).

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix for this issue involved removing the `--bearer-token` command-line parameter and reading the token from standard input. This is documented in the provided commit details (4d003e4) which removes the command-line option for the bearer token.
*   The advisory also mentions a temporary workaround for versions 0.4.14 and later which was the use of the `--read-bearer-token-from-stdin` flag, and then providing the token through standard in.
* The advisory states that versions prior to 0.4.14 do not have a workaround.

This information aligns with the description of CWE-214 (Credentials Management Errors) and provides specific context regarding how the vulnerability is triggered and exploited.
