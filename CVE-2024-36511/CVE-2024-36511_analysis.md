# Analysis for CVE-2024-36511

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-358 | Improperly Implemented Security Check for Standard | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE. The vulnerability description explicitly states this CWE as the root cause. |
| CWE-784 | Reliance on Cookies without Validation and Integrity Checking in a Security Decision | 0.7 | Variant | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The vulnerability allows an attacker to retrieve the initial encrypted and signed cookie, indicating a reliance on cookies without proper validation. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-358, which indicates a problem with the implementation of a security check according to a standard. CWE-784 is a variant that addresses a reliance on cookies without validation in a security decision, which is a more specific case related to the cookie security policy. CWE-358 is a base CWE which is child of CWE-573 (Missing Essential Operational Practices). CWE-784 is a variant CWE which is child of CWE-807 (Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision) and CWE-565 (Reliance on Cookies without Validation and Integrity Checking).

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with an **improperly implemented security check [CWE-358]** in the FortiADC Web Application Firewall (WAF). This leads to a bypass of the cookie security policy, allowing an attacker to retrieve the initial encrypted and signed cookie. This can be seen as a reliance on cookies without proper validation and integrity checking **[CWE-784]**. The retrieval of the cookie is the impact, allowing potential further attacks depending on the contents and usage of the cookie.

## Summary of Analysis
The primary assessment is based on the explicit statement in the vulnerability description that the root cause is an **improperly implemented security check for standard vulnerability [CWE-358]**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary section reinforces this by stating: "Root cause of vulnerability: An improperly implemented security check for CWE-358 in FortiADC Web Application Firewall (WAF) when the cookie security policy is enabled." The weakness allows retrieval of signed cookies. Therefore, CWE-784 is included to map to the cookie aspect of the vulnerability.

The relationship graph influenced the selection by showing how CWE-358 and CWE-784 are related to broader categories of weaknesses.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-358 directly addresses the root cause, while CWE-784 specifies the type of data affected by the vulnerability (cookies) and how the security is bypassed (validation and integrity checking).

Relevant CWE Information:
*   **CWE-358:** Directly stated as the root cause.
*   **CWE-784:** Captures the aspect of cookie reliance without validation.
