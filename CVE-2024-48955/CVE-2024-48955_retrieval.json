This data is not encrypted and lacks proper session authorization validation.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\\n\\n*   **Broken Access Control:** The core issue is the lack of proper authorization checks. The system doesn\\'t verify if the user requesting the data has the necessary permissions.\\n*   **Lack of Encryption:** The data returned by the endpoint, which defines the functionalities available to a user, is not encrypted.\\n*   **Missing Session Authorization:** The system does not validate the authorization of the session accessing the endpoint.\\n\\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\\n\\n*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker, even with lower privileges, can gain access to functionalities of a higher-privileged user.\\n*   **Unauthorized Access:** By copying the unencrypted data from a higher-privileged user\\'s browser, an attacker can impersonate that user and access their functionalities within the system.\\n*   **Potential Data Modification/Disclosure:** The vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access to administrative functionalities. As the attacker can access these functionalities, it can be assumed that an attacker might modify or disclose data.\\n\\n**Attack Vectors:**\\n\\n*   **Network:** The attack vector is primarily adjacent (AV:A) as the attacker needs to be in a position to intercept and/or copy unencrypted data, but could be local if the attacker already has access to a system or remote if the attacker can intercept network traffic..\\n*   **Browser Manipulation:**  An attacker copies the unencrypted data from the browser of a user with higher privileges.\\n*   **Request Manipulation:** An authenticated attacker can alter the response from the server to render the user interface, effectively injecting administrative functionalities.\\n\\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\\n\\n*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a valid user of the Netadmin IAM system.\\n*   **Access to Browser Data:** The attacker needs to be able to copy the unencrypted response data from a higher-privileged user\\'s browser or manipulate the server\\'s response.\\n*   **Network Proximity (Potentially):** The attacker may need to be on the same network or able to intercept network traffic to capture the data from a privileged user.\\n\\n**Additional Notes:**\\n\\n*   The vulnerability is described in the context of OWASP\\'s Broken Access Control definition.\\n*   The provided CVSS v3.1 vector is AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L with a base score of 7.6, which aligns with a high impact vulnerability.\\n*   The vendor is currently working on a fix that is \"Em Homologa\u00e7\u00e3o\" (in homologation/testing). The recommended mitigation is to update to a patched version once available.\\n*   CWEs mentioned include:\\n    *   CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\\n    *   CWE-862: Missing Authorization\\n    *   CWE-284: Improper Access Control\\n    *   CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key', similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [],
