  "query": "Logsign Unified SecOps Platform Authentication Bypass Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to bypass authentication on affected installations of Logsign Unified SecOps Platform. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the password reset mechanism. The issue results from the lack of restriction of excessive authentication attempts. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to reset a users password and bypass authentication on the system. Was ZDI-CAN-24164.",
