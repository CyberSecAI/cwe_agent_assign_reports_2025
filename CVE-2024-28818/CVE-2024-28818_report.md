# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-28818

## Description

An issue was discovered in Samsung Mobile Processor, Wearable Processor, and Modem Exynos 980, Exynos 990, Exynos 1080, Exynos 2100, Exynos 2200, Exynos 1280, Exynos 1380, Exynos 1330, Exynos 2400, Exynos Modem 5123, Exynos Modem 5300. The baseband software does not properly check states specified by the RRC (Radio Resource Control) module. This can lead to disclosure of sensitive information.

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **CWE-1285** | **Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input** | 0.7 | Base | Primary CWE | Allowed |
| CWE-200 | Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor | 0.3 | Class | Secondary Candidate | Discouraged |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE selected is CWE-1285 (Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input), which is a base-level CWE. The vulnerability description indicates that the baseband software **does not properly check states** specified by the RRC module. This suggests a **lack of validation** of the RRC module states.

CWE-1285 has child CWEs like CWE-129 (Improper Validation of Array Index) and CWE-781 (Improper Address Validation in IOCTL with METHOD_NEITHER I/O Control Code). While these are more specific, the description does not provide sufficient detail to pinpoint the exact type of index, position, or offset that lacks validation. Therefore, CWE-1285 is the most appropriate base-level CWE.

CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) is included as a secondary candidate because the impact of the vulnerability is the "disclosure of sensitive information." However, as CWE-200 is a class-level CWE representing the impact, and the problem stems from a **validation issue**, CWE-1285 is the better choice as the primary CWE.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **improper validation** of the RRC module states (CWE-1285). This **lack of validation** leads to an exploitable condition that results in the **disclosure of sensitive information** (CWE-200).

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is primarily based on the vulnerability description, which states that the baseband software **does not properly check states** specified by the RRC module. This directly points to a validation issue. The retriever results also highlight CWE-1285 as a relevant candidate, further supporting this assessment.

While the impact is the disclosure of sensitive information, focusing on the root cause, which is the **lack of validation**, is more accurate. The graph relationships show that CWE-1285 can precede CWE-200, which aligns with the vulnerability chain.

CWE-1285 is selected because it's a base-level CWE that specifically addresses the validation issue, while CWE-200 only describes the impact of the vulnerability.
