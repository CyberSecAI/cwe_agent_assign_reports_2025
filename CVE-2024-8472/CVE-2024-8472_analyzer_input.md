## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2024-8472:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This occurs because user-controlled input is not sufficiently sanitized or encoded before being displayed on the webpage.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Specifically, the vulnerability is a reflected XSS. The application takes input from the user, does not properly sanitize it, and then includes the unsanitized input in the response, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this XSS vulnerability could allow an attacker to retrieve the session details of an authenticated user. This could lead to account hijacking, data theft, or further malicious actions performed on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the web application's `/jobportal/index.php` file. An attacker would craft a malicious URL or request that includes XSS payload in multiple parameters of this endpoint. When a victim visits the crafted link, the malicious script will be executed within the victim's browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not require any special privileges or authenticated access to exploit this vulnerability. They would need to be able to craft a malicious URL and trick a user into clicking on that link (or otherwise trigger the request).

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is categorized as a medium severity issue with a CVSS v3.1 base score of 6.3 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L).
- The vulnerable software is Job Portal version 1.0, developed by PHPGurukul using PHP and MySQL.
- The specific location of the vulnerability is within `/jobportal/index.php` and is triggered by "multiple parameters."
