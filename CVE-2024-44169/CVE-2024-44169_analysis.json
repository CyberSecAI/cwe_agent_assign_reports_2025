CWE-416, Use After Free, is a variant where memory is accessed after it has been freed. These two can be related, where an out-of-bounds write could corrupt memory management data structures, leading to a use-after-free condition. The relationship is that CWE-787 can precede CWE-416.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe416[\"CWE-416: Use After Free\"]\n    cwe787 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe416\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe416 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a memory handling issue. This leads to an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787), which could potentially corrupt memory and lead to a use-after-free condition (CWE-416). The **impact** is an unexpected system termination.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description states, \"An app may be able to cause unexpected system termination,\" and that \"The issue was addressed with improved memory handling.\" The **weakness** described in the CVE Reference Links Content Summary also states \"An app may be able to cause unexpected system termination.\"\n\nCWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is selected as the primary CWE because it aligns with memory handling issues that can lead to system termination. The retriever results also listed CWE-787 with the highest sparse score, and graph scores indicated it is a reasonable choice. CWE-416 (Use After Free) is considered as a possible secondary weakness, which could be a consequence of memory corruption due to an out-of-bounds write.\n\nCWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) was considered but rejected because the description focuses on memory handling rather than input validation. Other CWEs such as CWE-843 (Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type) and CWE-665 (Improper Initialization) were also considered but deemed less relevant because the core issue seems to be related to writing beyond the allocated memory region.\n\nThe selection of CWE-787 and CWE-416 is based on the provided evidence and the relationships between CWEs. Both are at appropriate levels of abstraction (Base and Variant, respectively).\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n*   CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write. The product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n*   CWE-416: Use After Free. The product calls free() twice on the same memory address, potentially leading to modification of unexpected memory locations.",
