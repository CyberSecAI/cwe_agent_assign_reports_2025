It has child CWEs like CWE-789 (Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value). CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) is a parent of CWE-770. The vulnerability description mentions \"partial denial of service (partial DOS) of MySQL Server\", which aligns with resource exhaustion scenarios often associated with CWE-770. The lack of specific details in the description makes it challenging to pinpoint a more specific variant, hence the selection of the base CWE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe789[\"CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\"]\n\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    cwe789 -->|CHILDOF| cwe770\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe770 primary\n    class cwe400,cwe789 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **allocation of resources without limits or throttling** (CWE-770), which then leads to a denial-of-service condition. The root cause is **improper** resource management that allows an attacker to exhaust server resources. The impact is a partial denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment considered CWE-NVD-noinfo due to the limited information in the description. However, the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" indicates that the vulnerability leads to a partial denial of service (DOS) and the retriever results point to `Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling` (CWE-770). This is further supported by the impact of the vulnerability, which is \"unauthorized ability to cause a partial denial of service (partial DOS) of MySQL Server.\" I've chosen CWE-770 as the primary CWE because it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability, while CWE-NVD-noinfo is a placeholder due to lack of information. The decision is based on the available evidence, graph relationships, and mapping guidance. CWE-770 is at the optimal level of specificity as a base CWE, given the lack of precise details about the allocation mechanism that is missing throttling.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is **incorrect**.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product generates an error message that includes sensitive information about its environment, users, or associated data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or **incorrectly** neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.

It has child CWEs like CWE-789 (Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value). CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) is a parent of CWE-770. The vulnerability description mentions \"partial denial of service (partial DOS) of MySQL Server\", which aligns with resource exhaustion scenarios often associated with CWE-770. The lack of specific details in the description makes it challenging to pinpoint a more specific variant, hence the selection of the base CWE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe789[\"CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\"]\n\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    cwe789 -->|CHILDOF| cwe770\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe770 primary\n    class cwe400,cwe789 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **allocation of resources without limits or throttling** (CWE-770), which then leads to a denial-of-service condition. The root cause is **improper** resource management that allows an attacker to exhaust server resources. The impact is a partial denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment considered CWE-NVD-noinfo due to the limited information in the description. However, the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" indicates that the vulnerability leads to a partial denial of service (DOS) and the retriever results point to `Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling` (CWE-770). This is further supported by the impact of the vulnerability, which is \"unauthorized ability to cause a partial denial of service (partial DOS) of MySQL Server.\" I've chosen CWE-770 as the primary CWE because it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability, while CWE-NVD-noinfo is a placeholder due to lack of information. The decision is based on the available evidence, graph relationships, and mapping guidance. CWE-770 is at the optimal level of specificity as a base CWE, given the lack of precise details about the allocation mechanism that is missing throttling.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is **incorrect**.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product generates an error message that includes sensitive information about its environment, users, or associated data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or **incorrectly** neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.
