## Vulnerability Description
qdrant/qdrant version 1.9.0-dev is vulnerable to arbitrary file read and write during the snapshot recovery process. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating snapshot files to include symlinks, leading to arbitrary file read by adding a symlink that points to a desired file on the filesystem and arbitrary file write by including a symlink and a payload file in the snapshots directory structure. This vulnerability allows for the reading and writing of arbitrary files on the server, which could potentially lead to a full takeover of the system. The issue is fixed in version v1.9.0.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** arbitrary file read and write
- **vector:** manipulating snapshot files to include symlinks
- **attacker:** attackers
- **product:** qdrant/qdrant
- **version:** 1.9.0-dev

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of snapshot archives, specifically tar archives, before unpacking them. The system was previously allowing any type of entry within the tar archive, including symbolic links (symlinks).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Unvalidated Tar Archive Entries:** The primary weakness is the absence of validation for entries within the snapshot tar archive. Specifically, the system was not checking for and rejecting symlinks.
- **Potential for Path Traversal/Arbitrary File Write:** Allowing symlinks within the tar archive can lead to path traversal vulnerabilities. An attacker could craft a malicious archive containing symlinks pointing outside the intended target directory. When unpacked, these symlinks would cause files to be created or modified in unintended locations, potentially overwriting important system files, or enabling other forms of attack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Write:** A successful exploit could allow an attacker to write files to arbitrary locations on the file system. This could be used to overwrite configuration files, inject malicious code, or cause denial of service.
- **System Compromise:** By overwriting critical system files, an attacker could potentially gain full control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Snapshot Archive:** The attack vector involves crafting a malicious snapshot archive containing symlinks and then having the vulnerable system unpack this archive.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Provide a Snapshot:** The attacker needs the capability to provide a crafted snapshot archive to the system. The specific position required to provide the malicious snapshot archive will be dependent on the vulnerable software configuration and use case.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix involves adding a validation step before unpacking the tar archive, ensuring that only regular files and directories are allowed as entries.
- The code changes are across multiple files related to snapshot management for both the collection and segment components of the system, indicating the widespread impact of the vulnerability.
- The fix includes changes to the `validate_snapshot_archive` modules in both the `collection` and `segment` crates, and the corresponding usage of the validation function during snapshot restoration
- The commit message "Fix snapshot tar symlinks validation" and the associated pull request (#4033) confirm that this change is specifically addressing a symlink vulnerability in snapshot archives.
