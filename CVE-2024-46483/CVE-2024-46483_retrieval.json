  "vulnerability_info": "VulnerabilityInfo(cve_id='CVE-2024-46483', description='Xlight FTP Server <3.9.4.3 has an **integer overflow** vulnerability in the packet parsing logic of the SFTP server, which can lead to a **heap overflow** with attacker-controlled content.', key_phrases={'rootcause': '', 'weakness': ['heap overflow', 'integer overflow'], 'impact': '', 'vector': 'attacker-controlled content', 'attacker': '', 'product': 'Xlight FTP Server', 'version': '<3.9.4.3', 'component': 'packet parsing logic of the SFTP server'}, reference_content=\"Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\\n\\n**Root Cause:**\\n- The vulnerability is due to an integer overflow in the function used by Xlight SFTP server to read strings from network packets.\\n- SFTP protocol strings are prefixed with a 4-byte length. The function has insufficient validation of this length during memory allocation.\\n- Specifically, an attacker can craft a large length which results in an integer overflow, leading to a much smaller memory allocation than needed, followed by an out-of-bounds memory copy.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\\n- Integer overflow: The 4-byte length is not validated properly when allocating memory, causing an overflow.\\n- Heap overflow: When the memory is copied, the source buffer is attacker-controlled and the size is larger than the allocated buffer. This leads to an out-of-bounds write.\\n- Out-of-bounds (OOB) read on 64-bit systems: Due to the use of `size_t` for allocation on 64-bit, a large memory region is allocated (~4GB). The subsequent `memmove` still tries to copy a much larger region, resulting in an OOB read.\\n\\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\\n- Code execution: On 32-bit systems, the overflow can corrupt adjacent heap structures, potentially allowing for code execution.\\n- Denial of service (DoS): The heap corruption or OOB read can crash the SFTP server, resulting in a DoS.\\n\\n**Attack Vectors:**\\n- The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a specially formatted SFTP packet containing a string with a length that causes an integer overflow.\\n- This attack can be launched during the SSH handshake, even pre-authentication, by manipulating strings such as supported algorithms, cipher suites, username, or password.\\n\\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\\n- The attacker needs network access to the Xlight SFTP server.\\n- No authentication is required; the exploit is triggered pre-authentication during the handshake.\", similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {}, 'top_cwes_by_threshold': {}}}, similarity_summary=SimilarityInsight(consensus_cwe='', top_cwes=[], confidence_levels={}, total_samples=0), analysis='', analysis_with_relationships='', criticism='', resolution='', relevant_cwes=[{'metadata': {'doc_id': '190', 'name': 'Integer Overflow or Wraparound', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product performs a calculation that can\\n         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic\\n         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than\\n         the original value.

CWE-197: Numeric Truncation Error (Score: 258.28)\n\nTruncation errors occur when a primitive is cast to a primitive of a smaller size and data is lost in the conversion....\n\n### 4. CWE-193: Off-by-one Error (Score: 256.98)\n\nA product calculates or uses an incorrect maximum or minimum value that is 1 more, or 1 less, than the correct value....\n\n### 5. CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input (Score: 251.60)\n\nThe product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties....\n\n## COMPONENT: 'packet parsing logic of the SFTP server'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this COMPONENT:\n\n### 1. CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound (Score: 283.58)\n\nThe product performs a calculation that can\n         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic\n         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than\n         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is\n         incremented to a value that is too large to st...\n\n### 2. CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input (Score: 251.60)\n\nThe product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties....\n\n### 3. CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow') (Score: 102.85)\n\nThe product copies an input buffer to an output buffer without verifying that the size of the input buffer is less than the size of the output buffer, leading to a buffer overflow....\n\n### 4. CWE-835: Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop') (Score: 99.14)\n\nThe product contains an iteration or loop with an exit condition that cannot be reached, i.e., an infinite loop....\n\n### 5. CWE-617: Reachable Assertion (Score: 96.66)\n\nThe product contains an assert() or similar statement that can be triggered by an attacker, which leads to an application exit or other behavior that is more severe than necessary....\n\n\n    # Analysis Instructions\n    1. For each keyphrase, identify the most appropriate CWE(s) that represent the weakness.\n    2. Consider how the different keyphrases might relate to each other in the vulnerability chain.\n    3. Provide a final determination of primary CWE(s) and any secondary CWEs.\n    4.
