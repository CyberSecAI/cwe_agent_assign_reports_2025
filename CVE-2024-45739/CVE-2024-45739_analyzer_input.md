# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-45739

## Vulnerability Description
In Splunk Enterprise versions below 9.3.1, 9.2.3, and 9.1.6, the software potentially exposes plaintext passwords for local native authentication Splunk users. This exposure could happen when you configure the Splunk Enterprise AdminManager log channel at the DEBUG logging level.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** exposes plaintext passwords
- **product:** Splunk Enterprise
- **version:** below 9.3.1, 9.2.3, and 9.1.6
- **component:** AdminManager log channel

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the Splunk Enterprise `AdminManager` logging channel potentially exposing plaintext passwords for local native authentication Splunk users when the logging level is set to DEBUG.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Plaintext passwords are written to log files when the `AdminManager` log channel is set to DEBUG, exposing the credentials of Splunk users. This is a violation of the principle of least privilege, as debug logs should not contain sensitive information.
- **Insecure Default Configuration:** While debug logging is intended for troubleshooting, if it's not properly managed or disabled after use, it can lead to a security vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Compromised User Accounts:** An attacker who gains access to the log files containing the plaintext passwords can use these credentials to access Splunk Enterprise with the compromised user's privileges.
- **Potential Lateral Movement:** Depending on the compromised user's role, an attacker may be able to further compromise the Splunk instance, other systems, or sensitive data.
- **Data Breach:** Access to Splunk could enable unauthorized access to the data it indexes and analyzes.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Local File Access:** An attacker with local file system access to the Splunk server can read the log files and obtain the exposed passwords.
- **Administrative Index Access:** An attacker with administrative access to the Splunk `_internal` index can search through the log events stored there and obtain the exposed passwords.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Local File System Access:** The attacker needs the ability to read files on the Splunk server's file system (where logs are stored).
- **Splunk Administrative Access:** The attacker needs administrative access (or equivalent privileges) to the Splunk instance, specifically the ability to search the `_internal` index which stores the log events.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability exists in Splunk Enterprise versions below 9.3.1, 9.2.3, and 9.1.6.
- The advisory provides remediation steps:
    1. Upgrade Splunk Enterprise to a patched version.
    2. Change the logging level for the `AdminManager` channel to a less verbose setting.
    3. Delete the affected log file: `$SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunk/splunkd.log`
    4. Delete log entries from the `_internal` index using the command `index=_internal component=AdminManager | delete`
- A Splunk detection is also provided to find instances of sensitive information disclosure in debug log channels.
- The Splunk Security Content team has provided a detection which can be used to identify potentially sensitive data being written into the \_internal index. The detection looks for components such as REST\_Calls, AdminManager, and JSONWebToken.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control

**Authentication**:
Determines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.

* Example phrases: "user must log in", "lack of login check", "bypasses login"
* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.

  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* – used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).

**Authorization**:
Determines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do. It decides access *after* identity is verified.

* Example phrases: "unauthorized access", "regular user can access admin panel", "role checks are missing"
* CWE relevance: use CWEs like 862, 863, 285 for authorization errors:

  * **CWE-862**: *Missing Authorization* – the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all.
  * **CWE-863**: *Incorrect Authorization* – the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).
  * **CWE-285**: *Improper Authorization* – general category for any flawed authorization logic or design.

**Access Control**:
A broader term that includes both authentication and authorization. Governs how resources are protected and who can access them under what conditions.

* CWE relevance:

  * **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* – top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear.
  * This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.

## Mapping Discussion – Common Misclassification Patterns

### 1. **CWE-306 vs CWE-862**:

* **306** is about lack of **authentication** (e.g., *no login required at all*).
* **862** is about lack of **authorization** *after* authentication (e.g., *admin check missing*).
* ✅ Example CWE-306: *“An unauthenticated attacker can invoke the password reset API.”*
* ✅ Example CWE-862: *“An authenticated user without admin privileges can delete any user account.”*

### 2. **CWE-285 vs CWE-284**:

* **285** is specific to authorization flaws – it's a better choice than 284 **if** the issue involves *improper or missing role checks*.
* **284** should be reserved for general access control issues when it’s unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.

---

## Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification

**Phrase like "unauthorized access" is not enough.**

* If you **cannot determine whether identity was checked**, assume it’s **authorization** and consider 862 or 863.
* If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** → CWE-306.
* If the **access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced**, but it's not due to missing checks, consider **CWE-284**.

---

## Good Mapping Examples

* ✅ **CWE-306**: “The endpoint `/admin/deleteUser` does not require any authentication.”
* ✅ **CWE-862**: “Any logged-in user can change any other user's email without being an admin.”
* ✅ **CWE-863**: “An admin check exists but incorrectly grants access to non-admin users.”
* ✅ **CWE-285**: “Application uses a static role check that fails when roles change dynamically.”
* ✅ **CWE-284**: “Inconsistent enforcement of access rules across services with unclear policy source.”
