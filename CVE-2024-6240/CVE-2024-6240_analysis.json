  "description": "**Improper privilege management** vulnerability in Parallels Desktop Software, which affects versions earlier than 19.3.0. An attacker could add malicious code in a script and populate the BASH_ENV environment variable with the path to the malicious script, executing on application startup. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to escalate privileges on the system.",

An attacker can add malicious code to a script and set the BASH_ENV environment variable to point to it. This script then executes upon application startup.\n- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper privilege management (CWE-269). The application does not properly control the execution environment, allowing an attacker-controlled script to execute with elevated privileges.\n- **Impact of exploitation**: Privilege escalation on the system, potentially leading to full system compromise.\n- **Attack vectors**: An attacker needs to be able to modify the BASH_ENV environment variable. This likely implies some level of access, but the specific vector is not elaborated.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have the ability to modify the BASH_ENV environment variable and inject a malicious script. The specific method of achieving this is not mentioned.",

CWE-266 directly contributes to the condition where the application starts with elevated privileges, allowing the injected script to execute with those privileges.

Because of the **improper privilege management**, the application executes this script with **unnecessary privileges** (CWE-250), leading to privilege escalation. **Uncontrolled search path element** (CWE-427) is a potential factor as well.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-266 (Incorrect Privilege Assignment). The application incorrectly allows the BASH_ENV variable to influence its startup environment, leading to the execution of attacker-controlled code with elevated privileges. This assessment is strongly based on the provided evidence, particularly the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section, which states \"**Root cause of vulnerability**: **Improper privilege management** in Parallels Desktop. An attacker can add malicious code to a script and set the BASH_ENV environment variable to point to it. This script then executes upon application startup.\" The selection of CWE-266 is further supported by the keyword matches and the privilege vs. permissions guidance, which recommends CWE-266 for role misassignments.\n\nCWE-250 (Execution with Unnecessary Privileges) is considered a secondary factor, as the application's design allows it to run with higher privileges than necessary, amplifying the impact of the injected script.\n\nCWE-427 (Uncontrolled Search Path Element) is also a candidate because the application uses an environment variable to find the script. If the attacker can control the search path, it could influence which script is executed.\n\nCWE-269 (Improper Privilege Management) was considered but deemed too high-level.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-250: Execution with Unnecessary Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 2.47\n**Source**: graph\n\n**Description**:\nCWE-250: Execution with Unnecessary Privileges\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-427: Uncontrolled Search Path Element\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 2.47\n**Source**: graph\n\n**Description**:\nCWE-427: Uncontrolled Search Path Element\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.",
