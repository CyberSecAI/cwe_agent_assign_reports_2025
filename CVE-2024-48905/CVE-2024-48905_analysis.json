This endpoint can be accessed by any authenticated\nuser, regardless of their role. Since the session endpoint also returns\nsession tokens for logged-in administrators, this vulnerability can be\nused to escalate user privileges.\n\nProof of Concept (PoC):\nThe vulnerable endpoint can be accessed with any valid session at the\nfollowing two URLs:\n- /rest/sessions\n- /desk/AR/rest/sessions\nThe following two curl commands can be used to send the requests:\ncurl -b 'MM\\_SESSION=########-####-4###-####-############::ReplyDeskWeb' \\\n'https://:/rest/sessions'\ncurl -b 'JSESSIONID=########################' \\\n'https://:/desk/AR/rest/sessions'\nIt is now possible to authenticate against the application server's REST API\nby sending the received session token as the \"MM\\_SESSION\" cookie.\n\nRoot cause of vulnerability:\nIncorrect permissions for an endpoint.\n\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities present:\nSession hijacking.\n\nImpact of exploitation:\nEscalate user privileges.\n\nAttack vectors:\nAccessing the /rest/sessions or /desk/AR/rest/sessions endpoints with a valid session.\n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position:\nAuthenticated user.\n\nMitigation or fix:\nFixed.\n```",

While CWE-732 is a Class-level CWE, it directly addresses the **incorrect permission assignment** for a critical resource (the /rest/sessions endpoint). CWE-668 is broader and discouraged.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe732[\"CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe732 primary\n    class cwe668 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **Insecure Permissions** assigned to the /rest/sessions endpoint. This leads to the exposure of sensitive session tokens, which can then be used to escalate user privileges.\n\nRoot Cause: **Insecure Permissions** on /rest/sessions endpoint -> Exposure of Administrator Session Tokens -> Privilege Escalation.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The **Insecure Permissions** on the /rest/sessions endpoint were the key indicator. The provided information clearly states, \"Root cause of vulnerability: Incorrect permissions for an endpoint.\"\n\nCWE-732, \"Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource,\" directly aligns with this root cause. While CWE-668, \"Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere,\" was considered, it is a higher-level Class that doesn't capture the specific issue of incorrect permission assignments as precisely as CWE-732. The decision to use CWE-732 is further supported by the vulnerability description key phrases which call out \"**Insecure Permissions**\".\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
