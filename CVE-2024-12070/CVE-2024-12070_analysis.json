  "description": "A **Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability** exists in the file upload feature of haotian-liu/llava, specifically in Release v1.2.0 (LLaVA-1.6). The vulnerability is due to **improper handling of form-data with a large filename** in the file upload request. By sending a payload with an excessively large filename, the server becomes overwhelmed and unresponsive, leading to unavailability for legitimate users. This issue can be exploited without authentication, making it highly scalable and increasing the risk of exploitation.",

The vulnerability description indicates that the **improper handling of a large filename** leads to the **allocation of resources without limits or throttling**, causing a Denial of Service. The relationship between CWE-770 and CWE-400 is hierarchical, with CWE-770 being a more specific case of uncontrolled resource consumption. CWE-20 is related as improper input validation could lead to resource exhaustion. The abstraction levels influenced the selection by favoring the more specific Base level CWE-770 over the Class level CWE-400.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    \n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    cwe770 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe20\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe770 primary\n    class cwe400,cwe20 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper handling of form-data with a large filename** (**rootcause**), which leads to **allocation of resources without limits or throttling**, ultimately causing a **Denial of Service (DoS)**.\n\nVulnerability Chain: **Improper Handling of Large Filename** -> **Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling (CWE-770)** -> **Denial of Service**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the Denial of Service vulnerability. The vulnerability description clearly states that the **improper handling of form-data with a large filename** is the root cause. This leads to an **allocation of resources without limits or throttling**, which is best represented by CWE-770.\n\nThe choice of CWE-770 is strongly supported by the vulnerability description, which explicitly mentions the **improper handling of form-data with a large filename** leading to the server becoming overwhelmed.\n\n> *\"The vulnerability is due to **improper handling of form-data with a large filename** in the file upload request. By sending a payload with an excessively large filename, the server becomes overwhelmed and unresponsive, leading to unavailability for legitimate users.\"*\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the selection by highlighting the hierarchical relationship between CWE-770 and CWE-400, favoring the more specific Base level CWE-770.\n\nCWE-770 is selected as the primary CWE because it accurately represents the weakness of allocating resources without limits or throttling due to the **improper handling of a large filename**. This is the optimal level of specificity as it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability. CWE-400 is considered as a broader classification but is less specific than CWE-770. CWE-20 is considered, but is too general since the specific **improper handling of the filename** is known.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
