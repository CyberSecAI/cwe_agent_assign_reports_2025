However, since the description explicitly mentions memory corruption, CWE-787 was deemed more specific and appropriate.

The retriever results suggested several CWEs, including **CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write**, **CWE-415 Double Free**, and **CWE-789 Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value**. Given the limited information, it's hard to pinpoint the exact root cause, but the fix involving improved memory handling suggests a memory safety issue. I've selected CWE-787 as the primary candidate because **out-of-bounds writes** directly cause **memory corruption**. CWE-415 and CWE-789 are considered as secondary candidates because they are also memory corruption issues. The evidence is based on the CVE summary stating \"A vulnerability in the Wi-Fi component that could lead to unexpected system termination or kernel memory corruption.\" The relationships between the CWEs, especially the parent-child relation between CWE-787 and CWE-119, helped refine the selection to the more specific CWE-787.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not Selected:* Improper locking does not seem to be the rootcause, the issue is due to memory corruption.\n\n## CWE-665: Improper Initialization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not initialize or incorrectly initializes a resource, which might leave the resource in an unexpected state when it is accessed or used.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
