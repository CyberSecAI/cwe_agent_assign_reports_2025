# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-37312

## Vulnerability Description
user_oidc app is an OpenID Connect user backend for Nextcloud. **Missing access control** on the ID4me endpoint allows an attacker to register an account eventually getting access to data that is available to all registered users. It is recommended that the OpenID Connect user backend is upgraded to 3.0.0 (Nextcloud 20-23), 4.0.0 (Nexcloud 24) or 5.0.0 (Nextcloud 25-28).

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **Missing access control**
- **impact:** register an account eventually getting access to data
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** user_oidc app
- **component:** ID4me endpoint

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-37312:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing access control check on the ID4me endpoint within the Nextcloud User OIDC app. This allows access to the ID4me functionality even when the ID4me feature is disabled in the app's settings.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Missing Access Control:** The core issue is the lack of proper access control on the ID4me endpoint. This allows unauthorized access to functionality meant to be restricted when the ID4me feature is disabled.
- **Unrestricted endpoint access:** The ID4me endpoint can be reached and used even when the ID4me feature is disabled in the app.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Account Registration:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to register a new user account.
- **Access to Data:** Successfully registered accounts can gain access to data accessible to all registered users within the Nextcloud instance.
- **Low Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact:** The CVSS score indicates a low impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability. This is because the attacker gets access to what any user would see.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely over the network.
- **Adjacent Network:** CVSS indicates "Adjacent" attack vector meaning the attacker would have to be on the same network as the victim's server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Nextcloud instance.
- **No Special Privileges:** No prior privileges or user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability. The attacker can be unauthenticated.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects versions of the Nextcloud User OIDC app up to and including 1.3.6.
- Patched versions are 3.0.0, 4.0.0, and 5.0.0, depending on the Nextcloud version.
- The vulnerability is identified by the GitHub Security Advisory GHSA-vw7g-959g-vj6q
- The provided commit [https://github.com/nextcloud/user_oidc/commit/9f68a716ecd264160a7c098b8840313f1ac855f2](https://github.com/nextcloud/user_oidc/commit/9f68a716ecd264160a7c098b8840313f1ac855f2) appears to be the fix for this vulnerability, which involves adding checks to prevent ID4ME routes from being used when ID4ME is disabled.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control

**Authentication**:
Determines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.

* Example phrases: "user must log in", "lack of login check", "bypasses login"
* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.

  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* – used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).

**Authorization**:
Determines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do. It decides access *after* identity is verified.

* Example phrases: "unauthorized access", "regular user can access admin panel", "role checks are missing"
* CWE relevance: use CWEs like 862, 863, 285 for authorization errors:

  * **CWE-862**: *Missing Authorization* – the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all.
  * **CWE-863**: *Incorrect Authorization* – the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).
  * **CWE-285**: *Improper Authorization* – general category for any flawed authorization logic or design.

**Access Control**:
A broader term that includes both authentication and authorization. Governs how resources are protected and who can access them under what conditions.

* CWE relevance:

  * **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* – top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear.
  * This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.

## Mapping Discussion – Common Misclassification Patterns

### 1. **CWE-306 vs CWE-862**:

* **306** is about lack of **authentication** (e.g., *no login required at all*).
* **862** is about lack of **authorization** *after* authentication (e.g., *admin check missing*).
* ✅ Example CWE-306: *“An unauthenticated attacker can invoke the password reset API.”*
* ✅ Example CWE-862: *“An authenticated user without admin privileges can delete any user account.”*

### 2. **CWE-285 vs CWE-284**:

* **285** is specific to authorization flaws – it's a better choice than 284 **if** the issue involves *improper or missing role checks*.
* **284** should be reserved for general access control issues when it’s unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.

---

## Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification

**Phrase like "unauthorized access" is not enough.**

* If you **cannot determine whether identity was checked**, assume it’s **authorization** and consider 862 or 863.
* If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** → CWE-306.
* If the **access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced**, but it's not due to missing checks, consider **CWE-284**.

---

## Good Mapping Examples

* ✅ **CWE-306**: “The endpoint `/admin/deleteUser` does not require any authentication.”
* ✅ **CWE-862**: “Any logged-in user can change any other user's email without being an admin.”
* ✅ **CWE-863**: “An admin check exists but incorrectly grants access to non-admin users.”
* ✅ **CWE-285**: “Application uses a static role check that fails when roles change dynamically.”
* ✅ **CWE-284**: “Inconsistent enforcement of access rules across services with unclear policy source.”
