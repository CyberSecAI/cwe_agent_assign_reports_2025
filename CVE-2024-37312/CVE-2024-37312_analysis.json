  "description": "user_oidc app is an OpenID Connect user backend for Nextcloud. **Missing access control** on the ID4me endpoint allows an attacker to register an account eventually getting access to data that is available to all registered users. It is recommended that the OpenID Connect user backend is upgraded to 3.0.0 (Nextcloud 20-23), 4.0.0 (Nexcloud 24) or 5.0.0 (Nextcloud 25-28).",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-37312:\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe vulnerability stems from a missing access control check on the ID4me endpoint within the Nextcloud User OIDC app. This allows access to the ID4me functionality even when the ID4me feature is disabled in the app's settings.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n- **Missing Access Control:** The core issue is the lack of proper access control on the ID4me endpoint. This allows unauthorized access to functionality meant to be restricted when the ID4me feature is disabled.\n- **Unrestricted endpoint access:** The ID4me endpoint can be reached and used even when the ID4me feature is disabled in the app.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Unauthorized Account Registration:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to register a new user account.\n- **Access to Data:** Successfully registered accounts can gain access to data accessible to all registered users within the Nextcloud instance.\n- **Low Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact:** The CVSS score indicates a low impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability. This is because the attacker gets access to what any user would see.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Network-based:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely over the network.\n- **Adjacent Network:** CVSS indicates \"Adjacent\" attack vector meaning the attacker would have to be on the same network as the victim's server.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Nextcloud instance.\n- **No Special Privileges:** No prior privileges or user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability. The attacker can be unauthenticated.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n- The vulnerability affects versions of the Nextcloud User OIDC app up to and including 1.3.6.\n- Patched versions are 3.0.0, 4.0.0, and 5.0.0, depending on the Nextcloud version.\n- The vulnerability is identified by the GitHub Security Advisory GHSA-vw7g-959g-vj6q\n- The provided commit [https://github.com/nextcloud/user_oidc/commit/9f68a716ecd264160a7c098b8840313f1ac855f2](https://github.com/nextcloud/user_oidc/commit/9f68a716ecd264160a7c098b8840313f1ac855f2) appears to be the fix for this vulnerability, which involves adding checks to prevent ID4ME routes from being used when ID4ME is disabled.",

Since the vulnerability involves **missing access control** on an endpoint, it points towards a **missing authorization** check. While **missing authentication** could also be a contributing factor, the primary issue seems to be that even if a user is authenticated, access to the ID4me endpoint isn't properly controlled based on whether the ID4me feature is enabled.\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe306 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing access control** on the ID4me endpoint. This leads to the ability for an attacker to register an account and eventually gain access to data available to all registered users.\n\n**Missing Access Control** (CWE-862) -> Account Registration -> Access to Data\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the **root cause** of the vulnerability. The description clearly states \"**Missing access control** on the ID4me endpoint\". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this by stating, \"The vulnerability stems from a **missing access control** check on the ID4me endpoint.\"\n\nThe Retriever Results also identified CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) as a high-ranking candidate. This, combined with the analysis of the vulnerability description, led to the conclusion that CWE-862 is the most appropriate primary CWE.\n\nThe guidance provided also steered towards selecting CWE-862, emphasizing the difference between authentication and authorization, with missing authorization checks falling under CWE-862.\n\nCWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) was considered as a possible secondary CWE, because while the main issue is **missing authorization**, there might also be some **missing authentication** involved. It's possible that the endpoint should not be accessible to unauthenticated users at all, but the description and CVE summary don't explicitly state that.\n\nThe decision to select CWE-862 as the primary CWE is based on the evidence that the **root cause** is a **missing authorization** check on the ID4me endpoint, allowing unauthorized access even when the ID4me feature is disabled. This aligns with the CWE-862 description and the provided guidance.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product generates an error message that includes sensitive information about its environment, users, or associated data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
