  "description": "An **authentication bypass** vulnerability has been identified in the REST and SOAP API components of Tripwire Enterprise (TE) 9.1.0 when TE is configured to use LDAP/Active Directory SAML authentication and its optional Auto-synchronize LDAP Users, Roles, and Groups feature is enabled. This vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers to bypass authentication if a valid username is known. Exploitation of this vulnerability could allow remote attackers to gain privileged access to the APIs and lead to unauthorized information disclosure or modification.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:** An authentication bypass vulnerability exists in the REST and SOAP API components of Tripwire Enterprise (TE) 9.1.0 when configured to use LDAP/Active Directory SAML authentication with the \"Auto-synchronize LDAP Users, Roles, and Groups\" feature enabled.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n*   **Improper Authentication:** The core issue is that the authentication mechanism in the APIs is flawed when the auto-synchronization feature is enabled in conjunction with LDAP/Active Directory SAML authentication. This allows unauthenticated access to the API.\n*   **CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm:** This CWE describes the specific weakness in the authentication implementation.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n*   **Privileged Access:** Successful exploitation allows remote attackers to gain privileged access to the APIs.\n*   **Unauthorized Information Disclosure or Modification:** This access could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information or unauthorized modification of the system's configuration and data.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n*   **Remote Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely through the Tripwire Enterprise APIs.\n*   **Unauthenticated Attackers:** Attackers do not need valid credentials; they can bypass authentication.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Tripwire Enterprise APIs.\n*   **Knowledge of a Valid Username:** The attacker must know at least one valid username that exists within the system. This username can be a user synced from LDAP/AD.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n*   The vulnerability is specific to Tripwire Enterprise 9.1.0 when using LDAP/Active Directory SAML authentication with the auto-synchronization feature.\n*   Tripwire ExpertOps was not affected by this vulnerability.\n*   The vulnerability can be mitigated by disabling the \"Auto Synchronize LDAP Users, Roles, and Groups\" feature but that also disables API access.\n*   The vendor recommends upgrading to Tripwire Enterprise 9.1.1.",

This is a Base-level CWE, which is preferred for root cause analysis. CWE-287, Improper Authentication, is a Class-level CWE and a parent of CWE-306, Missing Authentication for Critical Function. While CWE-306 could be considered because it is an authentication bypass, CWE-303 is more precise because the issue is not a complete lack of authentication, but rather a flawed implementation. CWE-287 is too general and discouraged by MITRE when more specific CWEs are applicable.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe303[\"CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    \n    cwe303 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe303 primary\n    class cwe287,cwe306 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **incorrect implementation of the authentication algorithm (CWE-303)** when Tripwire Enterprise is configured to use LDAP/Active Directory SAML authentication and its optional Auto-synchronize LDAP Users, Roles, and Groups feature is enabled. This leads to an **authentication bypass**, allowing unauthenticated attackers to gain privileged access to the APIs. This privileged access can then lead to **unauthorized information disclosure and modification**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is primarily based on the provided vulnerability description and the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\". The key phrase \"authentication bypass\" initially suggested CWE-306 or CWE-287. However, the detailed description in the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" explicitly mentions \"**Improper Authentication:** The core issue is that the authentication mechanism in the APIs is flawed\" and \"**CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm:** This CWE describes the specific **weakness** in the authentication implementation.\" This direct evidence strongly supports the selection of CWE-303 as the primary root cause. The hierarchical relationships influenced the decision by confirming that while CWE-287 and CWE-306 are related, CWE-303 provides a more specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability. CWE-303 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **incorrect implementation** aspect, which is the core flaw.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-287: Improper Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: class\n**Similarity Score**: 2.55\n**Source**: graph\n\n**Description**:\nCWE-287: Improper Authentication\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry might be misused when lower-level CWE entries are likely to be applicable.
