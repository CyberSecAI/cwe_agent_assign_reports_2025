## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved padata use integer wrap around to prevent deadlock on seq_nr overflow When submitting more than 2^32 padata objects to padata_do_serial, the current sorting implementation incorrectly sorts padata objects with overflowed seq_nr, causing them to be placed before existing objects in the reorder list. This leads to a deadlock in the serialization process as padata_find_next cannot match padata->seq_nr and pd->processed because the padata instance with overflowed seq_nr will be selected next. To fix this, we use an unsigned integer wrap around to correctly sort padata objects in scenarios with **integer overflow**.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **incorrect padata sorting implementation**
- **weakness:** **integer overflow**
- **impact:** deadlock
- **vector:** submit more than 2^32 padata objects
- **product:** Linux kernel
- **component:** padata_do_serial

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-47739 (Placeholder, based on content)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from an incorrect sorting implementation within the `padata_do_serial` function of the Linux kernel's padata subsystem. Specifically, when the sequence number (`seq_nr`) of padata objects overflows (exceeds 2^32), the sorting logic fails to handle the wrap-around correctly, leading to misordering of the objects in the reorder list.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Integer Overflow:** The `seq_nr` field, used for ordering, is a 32-bit integer. When enough padata objects are submitted, the sequence number wraps around to 0.
- **Incorrect Sorting Logic:** The sorting algorithm used a simple less-than comparison (`cur->seq_nr < padata->seq_nr`) which does not handle integer wraparound, resulting in the overflowed `seq_nr` being incorrectly considered smaller than existing ones.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Deadlock:** The incorrect sorting causes padata objects with overflowed sequence numbers to be placed at the beginning of the reorder list, before existing objects with higher sequence numbers. This disrupts the serialization process as `padata_find_next` will repeatedly select the padata objects with the wrapped seq_nr and will be unable to progress leading to a deadlock.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by submitting a very large number of padata objects (more than 2^32) to `padata_do_serial`, causing the `seq_nr` to wrap around.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to submit padata objects to the padata subsystem. This may involve having some kind of privileged access to the kernel, either through a local process, a driver, or a network service which interacts with padata subsystem.

**Patch Details:**

The provided patch addresses this issue by modifying the sorting logic to consider integer wrap-around using the following comparison:

```c
if ((signed int)(cur->seq_nr - padata->seq_nr) < 0)
```
This change calculates the difference between the sequence numbers and casts the result to a signed integer, effectively handling the wrap-around correctly when comparing the sequence numbers.

This ensures that padata objects are ordered correctly in ascending sequence number even when the integer overflows.
