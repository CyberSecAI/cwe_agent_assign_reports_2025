This leads to a deadlock in the serialization process as padata_find_next cannot match padata->seq_nr and pd->processed because the padata instance with overflowed seq_nr will be selected next. To fix this, we use an unsigned integer wrap around to correctly sort padata objects in scenarios with integer overflow.",
