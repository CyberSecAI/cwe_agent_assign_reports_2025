CWE-200 is a class-level CWE, and several more specific child CWEs were considered. However, based on the limited information, it is difficult to pinpoint the exact mechanism of user enumeration. CWE-204 was considered as a more specific base CWE, but the evidence is not strong enough to confirm that the enumeration happens because of observable differences in responses. The abstraction levels were important in choosing the most appropriate CWE, favoring the higher-level CWE-200 due to a lack of detailed information.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe204[\"CWE-204: Observable Response Discrepancy\"]\n    cwe209[\"CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information\"]\n\n    cwe204 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe209 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe204 secondary\n    class cwe209 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **server misconfiguration**, which leads to user enumeration.\n- Root Cause: **server misconfiguration**\n- Impact: user enumeration\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on identifying a CWE that accurately reflects the root cause and impact of the vulnerability. The vulnerability description mentions a **server misconfiguration** leading to user enumeration. Based on the provided evidence, the most appropriate CWE is CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor), as it broadly covers the exposure of sensitive user information due to the misconfiguration.\n\nThe Retriever Results suggested several CWEs, including CWE-209 (Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information) and CWE-204 (Observable Response Discrepancy). While these are potentially related, the evidence provided does not explicitly state that the user enumeration is achieved through error messages or observable discrepancies. Therefore, CWE-200 is the most suitable choice as it directly addresses the impact of the vulnerability.\n\nThe graph relationships highlighted the hierarchical structure of CWEs, with CWE-200 being a higher-level class. While more specific CWEs like CWE-204 and CWE-209 were considered, the lack of detailed evidence supported the selection of the more general CWE-200. The decision is based on the available evidence, focusing on the **server misconfiguration** and its direct impact on exposing sensitive user information.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-204: Observable Response Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product provides different responses to incoming requests in a way that reveals internal state information to an unauthorized actor outside of the intended control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product processes an XML document that can contain XML entities with URIs that resolve to documents outside of the intended sphere of control, causing the product to embed incorrect documents into its output.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-202: Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Data Queries\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nWhen trying to keep information confidential, an attacker can often infer some of the information by using statistics.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-200 is commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error.
