  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-41113:\n\n**CVE-2024-41113**\n\n*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application uses the `eval()` function on user-provided input for the `vis_params` variable in the `pages/1_\ud83d\udcf7_Timelapse.py` file, specifically within the \"Any Earth Engine ImageCollection\" option. This allows for arbitrary code execution.\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n    *   **Unsafe use of `eval()`:** The primary weakness is using `eval()` on untrusted user input, which directly translates to arbitrary code execution.\n    *   **Lack of input sanitization/validation:** The application fails to sanitize or validate the user-provided string before passing it to `eval()`.\n*  **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the application. This could lead to:\n    *   Full control of the server.\n    *   Data exfiltration.\n    *   Denial of service.\n    *   Further attacks on other systems accessible from the server.\n*   **Attack vectors:**\n    *   The attacker would need to interact with the web application's user interface.\n    *   Specifically, they would need to access the \"Timelapse\" feature under the \"Any Earth Engine ImageCollection\" option.\n    *   They would then need to insert malicious code into the `Enter visualization parameters` text area.\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n    *   The attacker must have network access to the web application.\n    *   The attacker must be able to interact with the web interface, specifically the \"Timelapse\" tool.\n\n**Summary of related content from the provided files:**\n\n*   The file `github.com_8497f14a_20250110_213841.html` shows the vulnerable code in `pages/1_\ud83d\udcf7_Timelapse.py` that takes user input and uses `eval()`:\n    ```python\n        if bands:\n            vis_params = st.text_area(\n                \"Enter visualization parameters\",\n                \"{'bands': [\"\n                + \", \".join([f\"'{band}'\" for band in bands])\n                + \"]}\",\n            )\n        else:\n            vis_params = st.text_area(\n                \"Enter visualization parameters\",\n                \"{}\",\n            )\n        try:\n            st.session_state[\"vis_params\"] = eval(vis_params)\n    ```\n*   The file `github.com_6724fdc4_20250110_213843.html` contains the commit that fixes the vulnerability by replacing `eval()` with `json.loads()`:\n    ```diff\n    --- a/pages/1_\ud83d\udcf7_Timelapse.py\n    +++ b/pages/1_\ud83d\udcf7_Timelapse.py\n    @@ -392,7 +395,9 @@\n                 \"{}\",\n             )\n             try:\n    -            st.session_state[\"vis_params\"] = eval(vis_params)\n    +            st.session_state[\"vis_params\"] = json.loads(\n    +                vis_params.replace(\"'\", '\"')\n    +            )\n                 st.session_state[\"vis_params\"][\"palette\"] = st.session_state[\n                     \"palette\"\n                 ]\n    ```\n*   The file `securitylab.github.com_6f98c703_20250110_213843.html` describes the vulnerability (GHSL-2024-101) and provides a Proof of Concept.\n\n**Additional details from the Github Security Lab report:**\nThe report confirms that the `vis_params` variable is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) because the application uses `eval()` on user-controlled input.\n\nThis content provides more detail than the official CVE description (PLACEHOLDER).",

CWE-95 is a variant of CWE-94 (Improper Control of Generation of Code), but CWE-95 is more specific because it explicitly involves the use of `eval()`. Therefore, CWE-95 is the more appropriate choice.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe95[\"CWE-95: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection')\"]\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n    \n    cwe95 -->|CHILDOF| cwe94\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe95 primary\n    class cwe94 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain consists of the following:\n1.  The application takes user input for the `vis_params` variable without proper validation.\n2.  The application then uses the `eval()` function on this user-provided input.\n3.  This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary code, leading to remote code execution.\n\nThe root cause is the **improper use of `eval()` with user-controlled input**. The impact is remote code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, which clearly states that the application uses the `eval()` function on user-provided input, leading to remote code execution.\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"the `vis_params` variable on line 383 or line 390 in `pages/1__Timelapse.py` takes user input, which is later used in the `eval()` function on line 395, leading to remote code execution.\"\n\nThe CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms: \"The application uses the `eval()` function on user-provided input for the `vis_params` variable in the `pages/1_\ud83d\udcf7_Timelapse.py` file, specifically within the \"Any Earth Engine ImageCollection\" option. This allows for arbitrary code execution.\"\n\nCWE-95 is the most specific and appropriate CWE because it directly addresses the **improper use of `eval()`**. The other CWEs considered were either too general (e.g., CWE-94) or did not accurately reflect the specific vulnerability (e.g., CWE-78, CWE-917).\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-1286: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input that is expected to be well-formed - i.e., to comply with a certain syntax - but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input complies with the syntax.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-95: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes code syntax before using the input in a dynamic evaluation call (e.g. \"eval\").\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-451: User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe user interface (UI) does not properly represent critical information to the user, allowing the information - or its source - to be obscured or spoofed. This is often a component in phishing attacks.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product establishes a communication channel to (or from) an endpoint for privileged or protected operations, but it does not properly ensure that it is communicating with the correct endpoint.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.\n\n## CWE-917: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an expression language (EL) statement in a framework such as a Java Server Page (JSP) using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended EL statement before it is executed.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-95: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 1174.18\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes code syntax before using the input",

This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary code, leading to remote code execution.\n\nThe root cause is the **improper use of `eval()` with user-controlled input**. The impact is remote code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, which clearly states that the application uses the `eval()` function on user-provided input, leading to remote code execution.\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"the `vis_params` variable on line 383 or line 390 in `pages/1__Timelapse.py` takes user input, which is later used in the `eval()` function on line 395, leading to remote code execution.\"\n\nThe CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms: \"The application uses the `eval()` function on user-provided input for the `vis_params` variable in the `pages/1_\ud83d\udcf7_Timelapse.py` file, specifically within the \"Any Earth Engine ImageCollection\" option. This allows for arbitrary code execution.\"\n\nCWE-95 is the most specific and appropriate CWE because it directly addresses the **improper use of `eval()`**. The other CWEs considered were either too general (e.g., CWE-94) or did not accurately reflect the specific vulnerability (e.g., CWE-78, CWE-917).\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-1286: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input that is expected to be well-formed - i.e., to comply with a certain syntax - but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input complies with the syntax.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-95: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes code syntax before using the input in a dynamic evaluation call (e.g. \"eval\").\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-451: User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe user interface (UI) does not properly represent critical information to the user, allowing the information - or its source - to be obscured or spoofed. This is often a component in phishing attacks.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product establishes a communication channel to (or from) an endpoint for privileged or protected operations, but it does not properly ensure that it is communicating with the correct endpoint.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.\n\n## CWE-917: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an expression language (EL) statement in a framework such as a Java Server Page (JSP) using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended EL statement before it is executed.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-95: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 1174.18\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes code syntax before using the input\n\n\n## CWE Relationship Analysis\n\nCurrent CWEs represent these abstraction levels: .\n\n\n### Vulnerability Chain Analysis\n\n**Chain starting from CWE-116:**\n- 116 (Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output) - ROOT\n\n\n**Chain starting from CWE-94:**\n- 94 (Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')) - ROOT\n\n\n\n### CWE Relationship Diagram\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n```",
