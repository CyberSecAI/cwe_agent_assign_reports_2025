Therefore, CWE-259 is a child of CWE-798. While CWE-798 is a broader category, CWE-259 is a more precise description of the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe259[\"CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password\"]\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    \n    cwe259 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe259 primary\n    class cwe798 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward: The **hardcoded password** (CWE-259) allows attackers to log in as root, gaining unauthorized access to the system.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that there's a **hardcoded password** in `/etc/shadow` that allows attackers to log in as root. This directly corresponds to CWE-259 (Use of Hard-coded Password). CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials) is also relevant as a more general case, but CWE-259 is more specific and accurate. The retriever results also support this, with CWE-259 being the top result.\n\nThe relationship analysis shows that CWE-259 is a child of CWE-798, which means it's a more specific type of hardcoded credential. Choosing CWE-259 provides a more accurate representation of the vulnerability.\n\nThe evidence is based on the vulnerability description: \"H3C Magic B1ST v100R012 was discovered to contain a **hardcoded password** vulnerability in /etc/shadow, which allows attackers to log in as root.\"\n\nThe selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly reflects the type of
