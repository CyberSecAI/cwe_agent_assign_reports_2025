An authenticated user can cause arbitrary, unsandboxed javascript to be executed on the server. If you are using the switch task plugin, please upgrade to version 3.2.2.', key_phrases={'rootcause': ['Improper Input Validation', 'Input Validation vulnerability'], 'weakness': '', 'impact': 'arbitrary unsandboxed javascript execution', 'vector': '', 'attacker': 'authenticated user', 'product': 'Apache DolphinScheduler', 'version': '', 'component': 'switch task plugin'}, reference_content='Based on the provided content, here\\'s an analysis of CVE-2024-29831:\\n\\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\\nThe vulnerability stems from improper input validation within the Apache DolphinScheduler application, specifically related to the switch task plugin. This lack of validation allows the injection and execution of arbitrary javascript code.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\\n- **Improper Input Validation:** The core issue is that the application doesn\\'t properly sanitize or validate user-provided input, leading to the possibility of injecting malicious code.\\n- **Arbitrary Javascript Execution:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary, unsandboxed Javascript code on the server, bypassing security measures.\\n\\n**Impact of exploitation:**\\n- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The most significant impact is the ability to execute arbitrary code on the server. This could lead to:\\n    - Complete server compromise.\\n    - Data exfiltration or manipulation.\\n    - Denial of service.\\n    - Installation of malware.\\n\\n**Attack vectors:**\\n- **Authenticated User:** The attack vector requires an authenticated user of the Apache DolphinScheduler application to exploit this vulnerability via the switch task plugin.\\n\\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\\n- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to have a valid user account within the Apache DolphinScheduler system to leverage this vulnerability.\\n- **Usage of the Switch Task Plugin:** The attacker needs to interact with the vulnerable \"switch task plugin\" to inject the malicious javascript.\\n\\n**Summary:**\\nCVE-2024-29831 describes an RCE vulnerability in Apache DolphinScheduler where an authenticated user can execute arbitrary Javascript on the server via a switch task plugin due to insufficient input validation. The impact could be complete server compromise, data theft or manipulation, and denial of service.', similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {}, 'top_cwes_by_threshold': {}}}, similarity_summary=SimilarityInsight(consensus_cwe='', top_cwes=[], confidence_levels={}, total_samples=0), analysis='', analysis_with_relationships='', criticism='', resolution='', relevant_cwes=[{'metadata': {'doc_id': '20', 'name': 'Improper Input Validation', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product receives input or data, but it does\\n        not validate or incorrectly validates that the input has the\\n        properties that are required to process the data safely and\\n        correctly.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'rootcause:Improper Input Validation', 'keyphrase': 'Improper Input Validation', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'rootcause:Input Validation vulnerability', 'keyphrase': 'Input Validation vulnerability', 'type': 'rootcause'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(225.95733798360186)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '1333', 'name': 'Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product uses a regular expression with an inefficient, possibly exponential worst-case computational complexity that consumes excessive CPU cycles.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'rootcause:Improper Input Validation', 'keyphrase': 'Improper Input Validation', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'rootcause:Input Validation vulnerability', 'keyphrase': 'Input Validation vulnerability', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'product:Apache DolphinScheduler', 'keyphrase': 'Apache DolphinScheduler', 'type': 'product'}, {'id': 'component:switch task plugin', 'keyphrase': 'switch task plugin', 'type': 'component'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(224.7156138643906)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '138', 'name': 'Improper Neutralization of Special Elements', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'rootcause:Improper Input Validation', 'keyphrase': 'Improper Input Validation', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'rootcause:Input Validation vulnerability', 'keyphrase': 'Input Validation vulnerability', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'impact:arbitrary unsandboxed javascript execution', 'keyphrase': 'arbitrary unsandboxed javascript execution', 'type': 'impact'}, {'id': 'attacker:authenticated user', 'keyphrase': 'authenticated user', 'type': 'attacker'}, {'id': 'component:switch task plugin', 'keyphrase': 'switch task plugin', 'type': 'component'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(220.91794744368582)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '116', 'name': 'Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
