The **missing capability check** can be classified as **Missing Authorization (CWE-862)**. CWE-434 can be a consequence of **External Control of File Name or Path (CWE-73)**.

This leads to **unrestricted file uploads (CWE-434)**. These files can then be used to achieve **remote code execution**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability is caused by **missing file type validation and a missing capability check** in the `ibk_restore_migrate_check()` function, as indicated in the vulnerability description. This allows unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files to the server, potentially leading to remote code execution.\n\nThe primary CWE is **CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type**. This is because the core issue is the ability to upload any file type without validation. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms that the root cause is the lack of file type validation.\n\nThe secondary CWE is **CWE-862: Missing Authorization**, because the **missing capability check** allows unauthenticated users to access the vulnerable function.\n\nI am overriding the retriever results because CWE-434 and CWE-862 more accurately reflect the specific vulnerability described.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.\n\n*   Not Selected: This CWE is not relevant because the vulnerability does not involve CSRF.\n\n## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*   Selected: This CWE is selected because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions that the plugin is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to **missing file type validation**.\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.67\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*   Not Selected: While related to authorization, CWE-862 is a better fit.\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.66\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*   Not Selected: This CWE is not applicable because the vulnerability doesn't involve assumed-immutable parameters.\n\n## CWE-862: Missing Authorization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.66\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*   Selected: This CWE is selected because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions that the plugin is vulnerable due to a **missing capability check**.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.66\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
