CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) is a class-level CWE and a parent of CWE-770, representing the broader category of resource exhaustion issues. The vulnerability description directly supports CWE-770 because it involves sending large payloads that cause the server to become unresponsive due to excessive resource allocation. CWE-400 is a consequence of CWE-770.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    \n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe770 primary\n    class cwe400 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **uncontrolled allocation of resources** (CWE-770), triggered by a large payload. This leads to **uncontrolled resource consumption** (CWE-400), which ultimately renders the Iglu Server unresponsive.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the vulnerability description indicating that sending large payloads renders the server unresponsive. This aligns with CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling), where the server does not limit the resources allocated, leading to consumption and unresponsiveness (CWE-400).\n\nThe evidence supporting CWE-770 is \"sending very large payloads to a particular API endpoint of Iglu Server and can render it completely unresponsive.\"\n\nThe retriever results showed CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) as the top candidate, but CWE-770 is a more specific and accurate representation of the root cause. While CWE-400 describes the outcome, CWE-770 pinpoints the **lack of limits on resource allocation** as the underlying issue.\n\nThe final selection prioritizes CWE-770 as the primary CWE because it represents the root cause, while CWE-400 represents the impact. Both are at appropriate levels of specificity, with CWE-770 at the Base level and CWE-400 at the Class level.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.67\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.67\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web server receives a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-346: Origin Validation Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.67\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly verify that the source of data or communication is valid.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-1286: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.66\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input that is expected to be well-formed -
