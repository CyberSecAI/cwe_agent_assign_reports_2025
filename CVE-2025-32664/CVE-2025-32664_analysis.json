The impact varies case by case.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\nThe attack vector is Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\nUnauthenticated attacker.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\nNo official fix is currently available. Patchstack offers a \"vPatch\" as a mitigation.\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n*   **CVSS Score:** 7.1 (Low severity)\n*   **Affected Software:** Nepali Date Utilities Plugin\n*   **Vulnerable Versions:** <= 1.0.15\n*   **OWASP Top 10:** A1: Broken Access Control\n*   **PSID:** 3dfde5aac8ef\n*   **Reported by:** Skalucy (25 Feb 2025)\n*   **Published by:** Patchstack (09 Apr 2025)\n*   The report indicates that a patch is unnecessary, but this is unclear.",
