## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain consists of the divide by zero error. The **rootcause** is the **Divide-by-zero in pwm_mediatek_config()** due to the fact that the `!CONFIG_HAVE_CLK` version of `clk_get_rate()` returns zero.

## Summary of Analysis
The vulnerability description clearly indicates a **divide-by-zero** error. The line `do_div(resolution, clk_get_rate(pc->clk_pwms[pwm->hwpwm]))` causes a divide by zero because `clk_get_rate()` returns zero.

CWE-369 Divide By Zero is the most appropriate CWE because it directly addresses the **rootcause** of the vulnerability. The description for CWE-369 matches the vulnerability description.
