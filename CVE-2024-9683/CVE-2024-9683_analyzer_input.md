# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-9683

## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability was found in Quay, which allows successful authentication even when a truncated password version is provided. This flaw affects the authentication mechanism, reducing the overall security of password enforcement. While the risk is relatively low due to the typical length of the passwords used (73 characters), this vulnerability can still be exploited to reduce the complexity of brute-force or password-guessing attacks. The truncation of passwords weakens the overall authentication process, thereby reducing the effectiveness of password policies and potentially increasing the risk of unauthorized access in the future.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **authentication mechanism allows truncated password versions**
- **weakness:** **weak password enforcement**
- **impact:** brute-force or password-guessing attacks
- **vector:** truncated password versions
- **product:** Quay

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-9683:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from an issue in the Quay authentication mechanism where it allows successful authentication even when provided with a truncated version of the correct password.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

-   **Truncated Password Authentication:** Quay's authentication logic does not properly validate the entire password, allowing truncated versions to pass validation.
-   **Weakened Password Enforcement:** This leads to a reduction in the overall security of password enforcement, as shorter password segments become sufficient for authentication.

**Impact of exploitation:**

-   **Reduced Brute-Force Complexity:** Exploiting the truncated password authentication makes brute-force or password-guessing attacks easier as attackers would not need to guess the entire password to gain unauthorized access.
-   **Compromised Password Policies:** The vulnerability reduces the effectiveness of password policies, potentially increasing the risk of unauthorized access.

**Attack vectors:**

-   **Password Guessing/Brute-force:** An attacker can use truncated passwords to attempt to gain access by guessing a portion of the valid password.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

-   **Basic Network Access:** The attacker requires the ability to make authentication requests to the Quay system.
-   **Knowledge/Guess of Partial Password:** While not requiring the entire password, attackers need to guess or obtain a truncated segment of the password.

**Additional Details:**

- The bug report mentions that while typical passwords used may be long (73 characters), the vulnerability still weakens the authentication process by reducing password complexity.
- The vulnerability was found in Quay version 3.8.14.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control

**Authentication**:
Determines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.

* Example phrases: "user must log in", "lack of login check", "bypasses login"
* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.

  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* – used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).

**Authorization**:
Determines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do. It decides access *after* identity is verified.

* Example phrases: "unauthorized access", "regular user can access admin panel", "role checks are missing"
* CWE relevance: use CWEs like 862, 863, 285 for authorization errors:

  * **CWE-862**: *Missing Authorization* – the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all.
  * **CWE-863**: *Incorrect Authorization* – the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).
  * **CWE-285**: *Improper Authorization* – general category for any flawed authorization logic or design.

**Access Control**:
A broader term that includes both authentication and authorization. Governs how resources are protected and who can access them under what conditions.

* CWE relevance:

  * **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* – top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear.
  * This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.

## Mapping Discussion – Common Misclassification Patterns

### 1. **CWE-306 vs CWE-862**:

* **306** is about lack of **authentication** (e.g., *no login required at all*).
* **862** is about lack of **authorization** *after* authentication (e.g., *admin check missing*).
* ✅ Example CWE-306: *“An unauthenticated attacker can invoke the password reset API.”*
* ✅ Example CWE-862: *“An authenticated user without admin privileges can delete any user account.”*

### 2. **CWE-285 vs CWE-284**:

* **285** is specific to authorization flaws – it's a better choice than 284 **if** the issue involves *improper or missing role checks*.
* **284** should be reserved for general access control issues when it’s unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.

---

## Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification

**Phrase like "unauthorized access" is not enough.**

* If you **cannot determine whether identity was checked**, assume it’s **authorization** and consider 862 or 863.
* If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** → CWE-306.
* If the **access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced**, but it's not due to missing checks, consider **CWE-284**.

---

## Good Mapping Examples

* ✅ **CWE-306**: “The endpoint `/admin/deleteUser` does not require any authentication.”
* ✅ **CWE-862**: “Any logged-in user can change any other user's email without being an admin.”
* ✅ **CWE-863**: “An admin check exists but incorrectly grants access to non-admin users.”
* ✅ **CWE-285**: “Application uses a static role check that fails when roles change dynamically.”
* ✅ **CWE-284**: “Inconsistent enforcement of access rules across services with unclear policy source.”
