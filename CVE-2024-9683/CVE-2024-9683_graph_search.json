  "query": "A vulnerability was found in Quay, which allows successful authentication even when a truncated password version is provided. This flaw affects the authentication mechanism, reducing the overall security of password enforcement. While the risk is relatively low due to the typical length of the passwords used (73 characters), this vulnerability can still be exploited to reduce the complexity of brute-force or password-guessing attacks. The truncation of passwords weakens the overall authentication process, thereby reducing the effectiveness of password policies and potentially increasing the risk of unauthorized access in the future. Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-261 CWE-532 CWE-1390 CWE-836 CWE-640 CWE-330 CWE-1391 CWE-521 CWE-916",
