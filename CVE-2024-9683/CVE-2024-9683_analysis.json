  "cve_id": "CVE-2024-9683",
  "description": "A vulnerability was found in Quay, which allows successful authentication even when a truncated password version is provided. This flaw affects the authentication mechanism, reducing the overall security of password enforcement. While the risk is relatively low due to the typical length of the passwords used (73 characters), this vulnerability can still be exploited to reduce the complexity of brute-force or password-guessing attacks. The truncation of passwords weakens the overall authentication process, thereby reducing the effectiveness of password policies and potentially increasing the risk of unauthorized access in the future.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-9683:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\n- The vulnerability stems from an issue in the Quay authentication mechanism where it allows successful authentication even when provided with a truncated version of the correct password.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n-   **Truncated Password Authentication:** Quay's authentication logic does not properly validate the entire password, allowing truncated versions to pass validation.\n-   **Weakened Password Enforcement:** This leads to a reduction in the overall security of password enforcement, as shorter password segments become sufficient for authentication.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n-   **Reduced Brute-Force Complexity:** Exploiting the truncated password authentication makes brute-force or password-guessing attacks easier as attackers would not need to guess the entire password to gain unauthorized access.\n-   **Compromised Password Policies:** The vulnerability reduces the effectiveness of password policies, potentially increasing the risk of unauthorized access.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n-   **Password Guessing/Brute-force:** An attacker can use truncated passwords to attempt to gain access by guessing a portion of the valid password.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n-   **Basic Network Access:** The attacker requires the ability to make authentication requests to the Quay system.\n-   **Knowledge/Guess of Partial Password:** While not requiring the entire password, attackers need to guess or obtain a truncated segment of the password.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n- The bug report mentions that while typical passwords used may be long (73 characters), the vulnerability still weakens the authentication process by reducing password complexity.\n- The vulnerability was found in Quay version 3.8.14.",

This is best captured by CWE-287 Improper Authentication because the system is not properly validating the password. The impact of this **weakness** is that it reduces the complexity of brute-force or password-guessing attacks. The vulnerability description key phrases highlight the **rootcause** and **weakness** related to authentication.\n\nThe selection of CWE-287 is based on the fact that the authentication process is flawed by design. While the vulnerability isn't a complete bypass of authentication (CWE-306), it's still a failure to properly authenticate because it accepts truncated passwords.\n\nCWE-521 (Weak Password Requirements) is a secondary consideration. While the password length itself is not weak (73 characters), the fact that truncated versions are accepted effectively weakens the password requirements.\n\nCWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) was considered but is less appropriate because authentication is not entirely missing, but rather flawed.\n\nCWE-1390 (Weak Authentication) was considered but is a more general class and CWE-287 is more specific.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
