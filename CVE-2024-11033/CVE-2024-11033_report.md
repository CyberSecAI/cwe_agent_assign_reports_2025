# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-11033

## Description

A Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability exists in the file upload feature of binary-husky/gpt_academic version 3.83. The vulnerability is due to **improper handling of form-data with a large filename** in the file upload request. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a payload with an excessively large filename, causing the server to become overwhelmed and unavailable for legitimate users.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Component:** file upload feature
- **Rootcause:** improper handling of form-data with a large filename
- **Vector:** sending a payload with an excessively large filename
- **Product:** binary-husky/gpt_academic
- **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), become unavailable for legitimate users
- **Version:** 3.83

| CWE-1284 | Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship influencing the CWE selection is the hierarchical relationship between CWE-770 and CWE-400. CWE-770 is a base-level CWE, representing a more specific case of the class-level CWE-400. The vulnerability description strongly suggests that the **improper handling of a large filename** leads to uncontrolled allocation of resources, making CWE-770 a more accurate fit. CWE-1284 is potentially related as the large filename is not validated, however, the lack of validation leads to resource exhaustion, thus CWE-770 is a better fit as the root cause.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **improper handling of form-data with a large filename**, which leads to **uncontrolled allocation of resources** (CWE-770), and ultimately results in a **Denial of Service (DoS)**.

## Summary of Analysis
The primary CWE selected is CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling). This choice is based on the vulnerability description indicating that the **improper handling of a large filename** leads to the allocation of resources without limits, causing a denial-of-service condition. The evidence is strong, with the description explicitly mentioning the **improper handling** as the root cause. The retriever results also listed CWE-770 as the top candidate.

CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) was considered but deemed less specific. While the vulnerability does result in uncontrolled resource consumption, CWE-770 more accurately captures the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **unlimited allocation of resources**.

CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input) was also considered, as the filename size is a quantity not properly validated. However, the consequence of this **lack of validation** is resource exhaustion, thus CWE-770 better represents the root cause.

The selection of CWE-770 aligns with the MITRE mapping guidance, as it is a base-level CWE and the usage is ALLOWED.

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.66
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.66
**Source**: dense
