# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-11209

## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability was found in Apereo CAS 6.6. It has been classified as critical. This affects an unknown part of the file /login?service of the component 2FA. The manipulation leads to **improper authentication**. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **improper authentication**
- **product:** Apereo CAS
- **version:** 6.6
- **component:** /login?service of the 2FA component

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content describes a vulnerability in Apereo CAS versions 6.6.x, where an attacker can bypass multi-factor authentication (MFA) by manipulating the *execution* parameter during the login process.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application allows the reuse of an *execution* generated during the authentication process, specifically the *execution* generated after successful OTP validation. This *execution* can then be replayed, bypassing credential verification, CAPTCHA checks, and OTP entry.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of proper validation on the *execution* parameter.
- The system does not invalidate the *execution* after it has been used once, nor ties the *execution* to a single authentication attempt.
- The system is not enforcing MFA validation consistently across all entry points.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Account Takeover:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to user accounts by bypassing MFA.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers can access restricted areas or perform actions with higher privileges after successful bypass.
- **Data Breach Risk:** Attackers can view, modify, or delete sensitive data, resulting in data exposure.
- **Compliance Violation:** The vulnerability violates security regulations requiring MFA.
- **Reputational Damage:** The system is perceived as vulnerable due to the MFA bypass.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker captures a valid *execution* from a legitimate user's session.
- The attacker then resends the login request, replacing the current *execution* with the captured one.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to monitor network traffic to capture a valid *execution* from a legitimate user's authentication process (e.g. via Burp Suite or similar proxy).
- The attacker can then use the captured *execution* in subsequent login attempts.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control

**Authentication**:
Determines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.

* Example phrases: "user must log in", "lack of login check", "bypasses login"
* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.

  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* – used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).

**Authorization**:
Determines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do. It decides access *after* identity is verified.

* Example phrases: "unauthorized access", "regular user can access admin panel", "role checks are missing"
* CWE relevance: use CWEs like 862, 863, 285 for authorization errors:

  * **CWE-862**: *Missing Authorization* – the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all.
  * **CWE-863**: *Incorrect Authorization* – the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).
  * **CWE-285**: *Improper Authorization* – general category for any flawed authorization logic or design.

**Access Control**:
A broader term that includes both authentication and authorization. Governs how resources are protected and who can access them under what conditions.

* CWE relevance:

  * **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* – top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear.
  * This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.

## Mapping Discussion – Common Misclassification Patterns

### 1. **CWE-306 vs CWE-862**:

* **306** is about lack of **authentication** (e.g., *no login required at all*).
* **862** is about lack of **authorization** *after* authentication (e.g., *admin check missing*).
* ✅ Example CWE-306: *“An unauthenticated attacker can invoke the password reset API.”*
* ✅ Example CWE-862: *“An authenticated user without admin privileges can delete any user account.”*

### 2. **CWE-285 vs CWE-284**:

* **285** is specific to authorization flaws – it's a better choice than 284 **if** the issue involves *improper or missing role checks*.
* **284** should be reserved for general access control issues when it’s unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.

---

## Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification

**Phrase like "unauthorized access" is not enough.**

* If you **cannot determine whether identity was checked**, assume it’s **authorization** and consider 862 or 863.
* If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** → CWE-306.
* If the **access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced**, but it's not due to missing checks, consider **CWE-284**.

---

## Good Mapping Examples

* ✅ **CWE-306**: “The endpoint `/admin/deleteUser` does not require any authentication.”
* ✅ **CWE-862**: “Any logged-in user can change any other user's email without being an admin.”
* ✅ **CWE-863**: “An admin check exists but incorrectly grants access to non-admin users.”
* ✅ **CWE-285**: “Application uses a static role check that fails when roles change dynamically.”
* ✅ **CWE-284**: “Inconsistent enforcement of access rules across services with unclear policy source.”

| Role check is present but flawed                           | CWE-863        |
| General or ambiguous authorization failure                 | CWE-285        |
| High-level access control problem with no clear root cause | CWE-284        |
