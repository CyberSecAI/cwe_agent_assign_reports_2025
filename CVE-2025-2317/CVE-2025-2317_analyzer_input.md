# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-2317

# Vulnerability Description

    The Product Filter by WBW plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to **time-based SQL Injection** via the filtersDataBackend parameter in all versions up to, and including, 2.7.9 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.

    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis
