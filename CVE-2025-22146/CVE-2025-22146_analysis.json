  "description": "Sentry is a developer-first error tracking and performance monitoring tool. A critical vulnerability was discovered in the SAML SSO implementation of Sentry. It was reported to us via our private bug bounty program. The vulnerability allows an attacker to take over any user account by using a malicious SAML Identity Provider and another organization on the same Sentry instance. The victim email address must be known in order to exploit this vulnerability. The Sentry SaaS fix was deployed on Jan 14, 2025. For self hosted users if only a single organization is allowed `(SENTRY_SINGLE_ORGANIZATION = True)`, then no action is needed. Otherwise, users should upgrade to version 25.1.0 or higher. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",

CWE-290 (Authentication Bypass by Spoofing) is a child of CWE-287. CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key) is related to authorization bypass issues and is a child of CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization). The vulnerability involves **improper authentication** in the SAML SSO implementation. This results in an authorization bypass.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe290[\"CWE-290: Authentication Bypass by Spoofing\"]\n\n    cwe290 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe639 -->|CHILDOF| cwe863\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe287 primary\n    class cwe639 secondary\n    class cwe863 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with **improper authentication** in the SAML SSO implementation (CWE-287). This leads to an authorization bypass, allowing an attacker to take over user accounts (CWE-639).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment points to **improper authentication** as the root cause, leading to authorization bypass and account takeover. The evidence from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the root cause is **improper authentication** in the SAML SSO implementation. The vulnerability allows user impersonation. The provided link indicates CWE-287 (Improper Authentication).\n\nThe retriever results suggest several CWEs, including CWE-347, CWE-1390, CWE-863, and CWE-287. While CWE-287 is a Class-level CWE and is generally discouraged when more specific Base-level CWEs exist, none of the child CWEs of CWE-287 appear to be a better fit than CWE-287 itself.\n\nCWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key) is included as a secondary CWE because the **improper authentication** directly leads to an authorization bypass, allowing the attacker to take over user accounts.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web server receives a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
