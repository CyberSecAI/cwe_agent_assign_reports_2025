No other relationships are relevant.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe89 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain consists of a single element:\n1.  **Root Cause:** CWE-89 - Improper neutralization of special elements in an SQL command, leading directly to SQL Injection.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that the **weakness** is **SQL injection** due to improper handling of the `id` argument in `/visualizer-forneccedor.chp`.
