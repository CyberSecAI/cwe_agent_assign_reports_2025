The consequence is that remote, unauthenticated attackers can gain administrative access over the router.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary issue is the **lack of authentication** for the custom TCP service, allowing attackers to bypass security measures and gain administrative access. This aligns strongly with CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function). The **insecure permissions** (CWE-732) on the custom TCP service exacerbate the problem, making it easier for attackers to gain access once they bypass the authentication. I considered other authentication-related CWEs like CWE-287 (Improper Authentication), but CWE-306 is a more precise fit because the service lacks authentication altogether. The retriever results list both CWE-306 and CWE-732 with high relevance scores.\n\nRelevant evidence: \"Lack of authentication in the custom TCP service on port 5432 allows remote, unauthenticated attackers to gain administrative access over the router\" and \"Insecure Permissions\".\n\nCWE-287, CWE-798, CWE-284, CWE-330, CWE-1188, CWE-259, CWE-290, CWE-400 and CWE-337 were considered but not selected.
