Specifically, the vulnerability stems from the use of externally controlled input to select classes or code, leading to unsafe reflection.\n- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CWE-470, Use of Externally-Controlled Input to Select Classes or Code ('Unsafe Reflection'). This allows for object injection via insecure type resolution.\n- **Impact of exploitation:** Code execution. An attacker can execute arbitrary code by exploiting the insecure type resolution vulnerability.\n- **Attack vectors:** Object injection through insecure type resolution. The vulnerability is triggered by providing specially crafted input that can influence type resolution in an unsafe manner.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to supply input that affects the type resolution process. The exact method of providing this input might vary depending on how Telerik Reporting is integrated into an application.",

CWE-470 is a Base level CWE, indicating a specific type of vulnerability. CWE-502 (Deserialization of Untrusted Data) is considered a secondary candidate due to its relevance to object injection attacks. The relationship between CWE-470 and potential consequences like code execution helps refine the selection.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe470[\"CWE-470: Use of Externally-Controlled Input to Select Classes or Code ('Unsafe Reflection')\"]\n    cwe610[\"CWE-610: Externally Controlled Reference to a Resource in Another Sphere\"]\n    cwe502[\"CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data\"]\n    \n    cwe470 -->|CHILDOF| cwe610\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe470 primary\n    class cwe502 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **insecure type resolution** due to **externally-controlled input** used to select classes or code (**CWE-470**). This leads to object injection, which can then result in code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial analysis focused on the description of **insecure type resolution** leading to code execution. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" explicitly mentions **CWE-470** (Use of Externally-Controlled Input to Select Classes or Code ('Unsafe Reflection')) as a weakness present in the vulnerability. This aligns with the concept of **externally controlled input** being used to influence the selection of classes or code. The description strongly suggests that the **root cause** is the **insecure type resolution**, which enables object injection and subsequent code execution. Therefore, CWE-470 is the most appropriate primary CWE. CWE-502 is considered as a secondary candidate since object injection often involves deserialization issues.

CWE-470 is a Base level CWE, indicating a specific type of vulnerability. CWE-502 (Deserialization of Untrusted Data) is considered a secondary candidate due to its relevance to object injection attacks. The relationship between CWE-470 and potential consequences like code execution helps refine the selection.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe470[\"CWE-470: Use of Externally-Controlled Input to Select Classes or Code ('Unsafe Reflection')\"]\n    cwe610[\"CWE-610: Externally Controlled Reference to a Resource in Another Sphere\"]\n    cwe502[\"CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data\"]\n    \n    cwe470 -->|CHILDOF| cwe610\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe470 primary\n    class cwe502 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **insecure type resolution** due to **externally-controlled input** used to select classes or code (**CWE-470**). This leads to object injection, which can then result in code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial analysis focused on the description of **insecure type resolution** leading to code execution. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" explicitly mentions **CWE-470** (Use of Externally-Controlled Input to Select Classes or Code ('Unsafe Reflection')) as a weakness present in the vulnerability. This aligns with the concept of **externally controlled input** being used to influence the selection of classes or code. The description strongly suggests that the **root cause** is the **insecure type resolution**, which enables object injection and subsequent code execution. Therefore, CWE-470 is the most appropriate primary CWE. CWE-502 is considered as a secondary candidate since object injection often involves deserialization issues. The final decision is based on both the vulnerability description and the supporting evidence from the CVE reference links content summary.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-95: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes code syntax before using the input in a dynamic evaluation call (e.g. \"eval\").\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
