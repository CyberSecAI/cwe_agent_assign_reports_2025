  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE Report for code-projects Hospital Management System Using PHP With Source Code v1.0\n\nThis content is **RELEVANT** to a potential CVE, as it details a security vulnerability in a specific software product. It provides more detail than a standard CVE description would likely contain.\n\nHere's an extraction of the relevant information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\n*   Insufficient user input validation for the \"doctorspecilization\" parameter. The application directly uses user-supplied input in SQL queries without proper sanitization or validation.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   SQL Injection (specifically, time-based blind SQL injection)\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   Unauthorized database access\n*   Sensitive data leakage\n*   Data tampering\n*   System control\n*   Service interruption\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   POST request to `/hms/admin/doctor-specilization.php` with a malicious payload in the `doctorspecilization` parameter.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   An attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint. No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   **Use prepared statements and parameter binding:** This is the primary recommended mitigation.\n*   **Input validation and filtering:**  Strictly validate and filter user input.\n*   **Minimize database user permissions:** Limit the privileges of the database account used by the application.\n*   **Regular security audits:** Conduct regular security assessments to identify and address vulnerabilities.\n\n**Specific details:**\n\n*   **Affected Product:** Hospital Management System Using PHP With Source Code\n*   **Affected Version:** v1.0\n*   **Vulnerable File:** `doctor-specilization.php`\n*   **Payload Example:** `doctorspecilization=123' AND (SELECT 9138 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))vSBV) AND 'QECR'='QECR`\n*   **Vendor Homepage:** <https://code-projects.org/hospital-management-system-using-php-source-code/>\n*   **Software Link:** <https://download.code-projects.org/details/e13ce994-d280-4a64-90fb-f08663479bb4>",

The application directly uses user-supplied input in SQL queries without proper sanitization or validation. The retriever results also strongly suggest CWE-89 as the primary weakness. Therefore, CWE-89 is the most appropriate CWE for this vulnerability. The evidence provided is direct and clear, leading to high confidence in this assessment.
