  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-0392 Content\n\nThis content **IS RELATED** to CVE-2025-0392. It provides a detailed vulnerability report. Here's an extraction of the relevant information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation and sanitization when handling the `store_code` parameter in the `datagridGraph` method of the `GraphReportController`. Specifically, the code directly concatenates user-supplied input into a dynamic SQL query without proper filtering or escaping.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw. The `store_code` parameter is directly incorporated into the SQL query, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to:\n\n*   Access sensitive data from the database.\n*   Modify or delete data within the database.\n*   Potentially gain control of the database server.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   The attacker can send a crafted HTTP request to the `/graphReportController.do` endpoint with a malicious `store_code` parameter.\n*   The provided POC demonstrates using `sqlmap` to exploit the vulnerability.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.\n*   Authentication is required to access the backend, as demonstrated by the cookie used in the POC.\n*   Basic knowledge of SQL injection techniques is necessary.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\nThe report does not explicitly state a fix, but the root cause analysis implies that the following mitigations are necessary:\n\n*   **Input Validation:** Implement strict validation of the `store_code` parameter to ensure it only contains expected characters and values.\n*   **Parameterized Queries/Prepared Statements:** Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to separate SQL code from user-supplied data. This prevents the injection of malicious SQL code.\n*   **Escaping:** If parameterized queries are not feasible, properly escape all user-supplied data before incorporating it into the SQL query.\n\n**Additional Details (More detail than official CVE description):**\n\nThe report provides a detailed code walkthrough, pinpointing the exact locations in the Java code where the vulnerability exists:\n\n*   `org/jeecgframework/web/graphreport/controller/GraphReportController.java` (lines 303, 325)\n*   `org/jeecgframework/core/online/util/CgReportQueryParamUtil.java` (lines 39, 49, 60)\n*   `org/jeecgframework/web/graphreport/service/impl/core/GraphReportServiceImpl.java` (lines 145)\n*   `org/jeecgframework/core/common/dao/jdbc/JdbcDao.java` (line 149)\n\nThe report also includes a proof-of-concept (POC) using `sqlmap` and provides example HTTP requests with malicious payloads.",

Several other CWEs were considered, particularly those related to injection and neutralization, but CWE-89 aligns most directly with the vulnerability description.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n    cwe1336[\"CWE-1336: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n\n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe79 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe89 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe94 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe1336 -->|CHILDOF| cwe94\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe89 primary\n    class cwe78,cwe79,cwe94,cwe1336,cwe74 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper neutralization** of the `store_code` parameter leading to **SQL injection**.
