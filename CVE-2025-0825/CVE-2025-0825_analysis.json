The fix aims to address a vulnerability where an attacker could potentially inject malicious content into HTTP responses. The provided code changes include checks to validate header names and values, preventing the insertion of invalid characters that could lead to response splitting.\n*   **Mitigation or fix:** The commit introduces validation for header names and values using the `is_field_name` and `is_field_value` functions. These functions check if the provided header names and values conform to RFC specifications. The code also includes test cases to verify the fix.\n*   **More detail than the official CVE description:** The content explicitly mentions the vulnerability type (HTTP Response Splitting) and provides code-level details about the fix. The official description placeholder is missing.",

The vulnerability involves a failure to neutralize CRLF sequences. The presence of a null byte exacerbates the issue, represented by CWE-158. CWE-93 is the root cause and parent of CWE-113, while CWE-158 describes the specific condition making the CRLF injection exploitable.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe93[\"CWE-93: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')\"]\n    cwe113[\"CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\"]\n    cwe158[\"CWE-158: Improper Neutralization of Null Byte or NUL Character\"]\n\n    cwe113 -->|CHILDOF| cwe93\n    cwe158 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe93\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe93 primary\n    class cwe113,cwe158 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper neutralization of null bytes** (CWE-158) combined with **CRLF sequences** that leads to **CRLF Injection** (CWE-93). This then leads to HTTP Response Splitting (CWE-113).\n  - Root cause: CWE-158, CWE-93\n  - Impact: CWE-113\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is the **CRLF injection** (CWE-93) due to the **failure to neutralize CRLF sequences**. The vulnerability description explicitly states that the cpp-httplib library fails to filter CRLF characters. The retriever results also list CWE-93 as a potential match. Therefore, CWE-93 is the primary CWE. The **null byte** prefix is also explicitly mentioned, making CWE-158 a secondary weakness that enables the primary weakness. The **CRLF injection** leads to HTTP Response Splitting, represented by CWE-113. The graph relationships confirm that CWE-93 is a parent of CWE-113.
