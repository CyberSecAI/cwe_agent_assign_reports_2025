  "description": "BerriAI/litellm version v1.35.8 contains a vulnerability where an attacker can achieve remote code execution. The vulnerability exists in the `add_deployment` function, which decodes and decrypts environment variables from base64 and assigns them to `os.environ`. An attacker can exploit this by sending a malicious payload to the `/config/update` endpoint, which is then processed and executed by the server when the `get_secret` function is triggered. This requires the server to use Google KMS and a database to store a model.",

The **improper neutralization** of directives in this payload when processed by the `add_deployment` function, specifically during the decoding and decryption of environment variables, leads to the execution of arbitrary code. The root cause is the **lack of proper input validation** and sanitization before the dynamic evaluation takes place.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary classification is CWE-95 (Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection')) because the vulnerability description explicitly states that the `add_deployment` function decodes and decrypts environment variables from base64 and assigns them to `os.environ`, leading to remote code execution. This aligns directly with the CWE-95 description, which involves **improper neutralization** of code syntax before dynamic evaluation. The vulnerability occurs when a malicious payload is sent to the `/config/update` endpoint, processed, and executed by the server when the `get_secret` function is triggered. This is strong evidence of dynamic evaluation of untrusted input.\n\nCWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')) was considered due to its broader scope encompassing various injection vulnerabilities. However, CWE-95 is more specific as it focuses on dynamic code evaluation, making it a better fit.\n\nCWE-94 (Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')) was also considered because the vulnerability leads to code execution. However, CWE-95 is a more precise description of the root cause, which involves **improper neutralization** during dynamic evaluation rather than a general code injection scenario.\n\nThe decision is based on the provided evidence, particularly the vulnerability description's emphasis on dynamic evaluation and the **improper neutralization** of directives. The hierarchical relationships between CWEs, specifically the child-of relationship between CWE-95 and CWE-74, influenced the selection of the more specific CWE-95. The retriever results also show that CWE-95 is a strong candidate with a high score based on the description.",
