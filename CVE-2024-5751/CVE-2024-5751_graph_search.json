The vulnerability exists in the `add_deployment` function, which decodes and decrypts environment variables from base64 and assigns them to `os.environ`. An attacker can exploit this by sending a malicious payload to the `/config/update` endpoint, which is then processed and executed by the server when the `get_secret` function is triggered. This requires the server to use Google KMS and a database to store a model. Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-78 CWE-121 CWE-1336 CWE-95 CWE-94 CWE-306 CWE-863 CWE-532 CWE-1286",
