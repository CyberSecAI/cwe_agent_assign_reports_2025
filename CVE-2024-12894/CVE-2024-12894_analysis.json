  "description": "A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, was found in TreasureHuntGame TreasureHunt up to 963e0e0. Affected is an unknown function of the file TreasureHunt/acesso.php. The manipulation of the argument usuario leads to **sql injection**. It is possible to launch the attack remotely. This product is using a rolling release to provide continious delivery. Therefore, no version details for affected nor updated releases are available. The name of the patch is 8bcc649abc35b7734951be084bb522a532faac4e. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue.",

  "reference_content": "The provided content is related to CVE-2024-12894. It shows a commit that fixes a SQL injection vulnerability in `acesso.php` and `checkflag.php` files.\n\n- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability was caused by directly embedding unsanitized user-controlled input into SQL queries, specifically in the `$usuario` and `$problema` variables.\n- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL injection vulnerability.\n- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could manipulate the SQL queries by injecting malicious code, potentially allowing them to access or modify sensitive data, bypass authentication, or perform other unauthorized actions.\n- **Attack vectors**: By injecting malicious SQL code through the `usuario` and `problema` POST parameters.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP POST requests to `acesso.php` and `checkflag.php` with malicious SQL code injected in the `usuario` or `problema` parameters.\n\nThe commit replaces the vulnerable code:\n```php\n$usuario = filter_input(INPUT_POST, 'usuario');\n$sql = \"SELECT * FROM Usuario where id='$usuario'\";\n```\nwith:\n```php\n$usuario = filter_input(INPUT_POST, 'usuario', FILTER_SANITIZE_NUMBER_INT);\n$sql = \"SELECT * FROM Usuario where id=:usuario\";\n```\nand\n```php\n$problema = filter_input(INPUT_POST, 'problema');\n```\nwith:\n```php\n$problema = filter_input(INPUT_POST, 'problema', FILTER_SANITIZE_NUMBER_INT);\n```\nThis sanitizes the input to prevent the injection.\nAdditionally, it changes to use prepared statements which helps prevent injection attacks.\n\nThe provided content offers more detail than the basic CVE description.",

The **root cause** is the **improper neutralization** of special elements used in an SQL command. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship considered here is the parent-child relationship. While CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')) is a parent of CWE-89, the description clearly indicates SQL injection, making CWE-89 the more specific and appropriate choice. The other CWEs are not directly related in a hierarchical manner that would suggest they are more suitable classifications.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n\n    cwe89 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe89 primary\n    class cwe74 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Improper neutralization** of user-supplied input in SQL queries (CWE-89).\n2.  **Impact:** SQL Injection, potentially leading to unauthorized data access or modification.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, which strongly supports the classification of this vulnerability as CWE-89. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"**sql injection**\" resulting from the manipulation of the `usuario` argument. The CVE reference links confirm that the **root cause** is the direct embedding of unsanitized user-controlled input into SQL queries. The fix involves sanitizing the input and using prepared statements, further reinforcing the SQL injection classification.\n\nThe retriever results also strongly support CWE-89 as the primary candidate.\n\nCWE-79 was considered but deemed less relevant because the primary issue is not improper neutralization of input during web page generation, but rather within the context of an SQL query.\n\nThe selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity as it directly addresses the **root cause** and mechanism of the vulnerability.\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.
