It provides detailed information about the vulnerability.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) issue in the \"List of Posts from each Category\" plugin for WordPress. It allows a malicious actor to force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The plugin is susceptible to CSRF attacks due to missing or insufficient CSRF protection.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nA malicious actor can force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions. The specific impact varies depending on the actions available to the compromised user.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   An attacker can craft a malicious web request (e.g., a hidden form on a website) that, when triggered by an authenticated user, performs an action on the vulnerable website as if the user initiated it.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   The attacker does not need to authenticate.\n*   The attacker needs to be able to trick an authenticated user into triggering the malicious request (e.g., by visiting a malicious website or clicking a malicious link).\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   No official fix is currently available (as of March 11, 2025).\n*   Patchstack offers a \"vPatch\" to auto-mitigate the vulnerability even without an official patch.\n*   The vulnerability is considered low priority and unlikely to be exploited.\n\n**Additional Details (more detail than official CVE description):**\n\n*   **Affected Plugin:** List of Posts from each Category plugin for WordPress\n*   **Vulnerable Versions:** <= 2.0\n*   **CVSS Score:** 7.1 (Low severity)\n*   **PSID:** 93b986cee850\n*   **Researcher:** Abdi Pranata\n*   **Report Date:** February 24, 2025\n*   **Published Date:** March 11, 2025\n*   **OWASP Top 10:** A1: Broken Access Control\n*   **Required Privilege:** Unauthenticated\n*   The content also provides links to resources like the CVE record, Patchstack's vulnerability database, and information about virtual patching.",

The **rootcause** is **Cross-Site Request Forgery**. |\n| CWE-79 | Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') | 0.8 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The **weakness** is **XSS**, but the trigger is the CSRF. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship is that the CSRF vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious input, leading to XSS. CWE-352 is a compound weakness that enables other vulnerabilities. CWE-79 is a base weakness describing the improper neutralization of input, which is a direct consequence of the successful CSRF attack.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    \n    cwe79 -- CANFOLLOW --> cwe352\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe352 primary\n    class cwe79 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** vulnerability (CWE-352). An attacker exploits this by tricking a user into making a request they didn't intend to. This request contains malicious input, which is then improperly handled, leading to **Cross-site Scripting (XSS)** (CWE-79).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified both CWE-352 and CWE-79 as relevant. The **rootcause** is the **CSRF** vulnerability, which then enables the **XSS** vulnerability. The evidence supporting this is the explicit mention of both vulnerabilities in the description and the CVE summary. The relationship analysis highlights the connection between CSRF and XSS, where a successful CSRF attack can lead to XSS. The mapping guidance allows both CWEs. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-352 is at the Compound level which is allowed, and CWE-79 is at the Base level, which is the preferred level of abstraction.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.\n\n\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
