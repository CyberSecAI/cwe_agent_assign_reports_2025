  "description": "Rust is a programming language. The fix for CVE-2024-24576, where `stdprocessCommand` incorrectly escaped arguments when invoking batch files on Windows, was incomplete. Prior to Rust version 1.81.0, it was possible to bypass the fix when the batch file name had trailing whitespace or periods (which are ignored and stripped by Windows). To determine whether to apply the `cmd.exe` escaping rules, the original fix for the vulnerability checked whether the command name ended with `.bat` or `.cmd`. At the time that seemed enough, as we refuse to invoke batch scripts with no file extension. Windows removes trailing whitespace and periods when parsing file paths. For example, `.bat. .` is interpreted by Windows as `.bat`, but the original fix didnt check for that. Affected users who are using Rust 1.77.2 or greater can remove the trailing whitespace (ASCII 0x20) and trailing periods (ASCII 0x2E) from the batch file name to bypass the **incomplete fix** and enable the mitigations. Users are affected if their code or one of their dependencies invoke a batch script on Windows with trailing whitespace or trailing periods in the name, and pass untrusted arguments to it. Rust 1.81.0 will update the standard library to apply the CVE-2024-24576 mitigations to all batch files invocations, regardless of the trailing chars in the file name.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-43402:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability arises from an incomplete fix for CVE-2024-24576 in the Rust standard library's `std::process::Command` API. The initial fix aimed to properly escape arguments when invoking batch files (.bat, .cmd) on Windows. However, it failed to account for Windows' behavior of stripping trailing whitespace (ASCII 0x20) and periods (ASCII 0x2E) from file paths. This allowed attackers to bypass the fix by adding trailing whitespace or periods to the batch file name.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- Incomplete fix for argument escaping in `std::process::Command` when invoking batch files on Windows.\n- Failure to normalize batch file paths by removing trailing whitespace and periods before applying escaping logic.\n- Incorrect assumption that batch file names would always have the exact `.bat` or `.cmd` extension without trailing characters.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- An attacker can bypass the intended argument escaping mechanism when invoking batch files with untrusted arguments.\n- This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands by crafting malicious arguments.\n- The impact is limited to Windows systems where batch files are invoked through `std::process::Command` with user-controlled arguments.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- Attacker must be able to control the arguments passed to the spawned batch file process through the `std::process::Command` API.\n- The batch file name must have trailing whitespace or periods to bypass the initial fix.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- Attacker needs to be able to influence the execution of a Rust program that uses `std::process::Command` on Windows.\n- Attacker needs to be able to control the arguments passed to the `Command` API when invoking a batch script.\n- Attacker needs to ensure the batch file name used includes trailing whitespace or periods\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n- This vulnerability is a bypass of the fix for CVE-2024-24576.\n- The severity is considered low due to the specific conditions needed to trigger the vulnerability.\n- The fix for this incomplete fix was released in Rust 1.81.0, which now applies the mitigation logic to all batch file invocations regardless of trailing characters in the file name.\n- Prior to 1.81.0, a mitigation was to remove trailing spaces/periods from batch file names.\n\nThis information is more detailed than the basic CVE description which is just a placeholder, and it provides a comprehensive understanding of the vulnerability, its causes, and how it can be exploited.",

The secondary issue is the **incomplete list** of disallowed inputs, which failed to prevent the attack. The choice of CWE-88 as the primary weakness is based on the vulnerability description's focus on the **incorrect escaping** of arguments. CWE-184 is chosen because the fix was **incomplete**.
