CWE-863 [Incorrect Authorization] is a related class-level CWE that could also be considered. The relationship between these CWEs is that Incorrect Authorization (CWE-863) can be a specific type of Improper Access Control (CWE-284). Given the provided information, CWE-284 is a more direct fit.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe863 -->|PeerOf| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe284 primary\n    class cwe863 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a user authorized to access a view but then being able to **alter the intended collation**. This leads to the **impact** of gaining access to a different or unintended view of underlying data, due to **improper access control**.\n  - Root Cause: **Improper Access Control** (CWE-284)\n  - Impact: Unauthorized access to underlying data\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is primarily based on the information provided in the \"Analysis of CVE-2025-3082 Content\" section, which explicitly identifies **Improper Access Control** (CWE-284) as a weakness. The description states that a user authorized to access a view can **alter the intended collation**, leading to unauthorized access to underlying data. This directly corresponds to the definition of CWE-284.\n\nCWE-863 [Incorrect Authorization] was considered because it is related to access control. However, the description focuses on the ability to alter the intended collation to access unintended data, which aligns more directly with the broader concept of improper access control than just incorrect authorization.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the class level of specificity, which is appropriate given the information provided. No further details are available to narrow down the weakness to a more specific base or variant level CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web server receives a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product generates an error message that includes sensitive information about its environment, users, or associated data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-204: Observable Response Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product provides different responses to incoming requests in a way that reveals internal state information to an unauthorized actor outside of the intended control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-200 is commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error. As of CWE 4.9, over 400 CWE entries can lead to a loss of confidentiality. Other options are often available. [REF-1287].\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 845.97\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 813.84\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-20",
