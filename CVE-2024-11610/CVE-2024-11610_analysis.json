  "description": "AutomationDirect C-More EA9 EAP9 File Parsing **Memory Corruption** Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of AutomationDirect C-More EA9. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of EAP9 files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a memory corruption condition. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-24773.",

Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\n*   Lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of EAP9 files. This results in a memory corruption condition. (Zero Day Initiative)\n*   A file parsing memory corruption remote code execution vulnerability occurs when an application fails to safely handle data during the parsing of files, resulting in memory corruption. (certvde.com)\n\n**2. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Stack-based Buffer Overflow (Both sources)\n*   Memory Corruption (Both sources)\n*   CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow (certvde.com)\n\n**3. Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   Remote code execution (Both sources)\n*   Memory corruption (Both sources)\n*   Potential compromise of the target system (certvde.com)\n*   An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. (Zero Day Initiative)\n\n**4. Attack vectors:**\n\n*   File parsing (Both sources)\n*   Requires the target to open a malicious file or visit a malicious page (Zero Day Initiative)\n\n**5. Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   Remote attacker (Zero Day Initiative)\n*   User interaction is required (Zero Day Initiative)\n*   Low attack complexity (certvde.com)\n\n**6. Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   Update C-More EA9 HMI to V6.79 (certvde.com)\n*   Interim steps if immediate update is not feasible: isolate the workstation, control access, implement whitelisting, apply endpoint security, monitor and log activity, harden the workstation, use secure backup and recovery, conduct regular risk assessments. (certvde.com)\n\n**Additional Details (More detail than official CVE description):**\n\n*   **CVSS Scores:**\n    *   CVSS v3.1: 7.8 (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) (certvde.com)\n    *   CVSS v4.0: 8.4 (AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:A/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N) (Both sources)\n*   **Researcher:** Andrea Micalizzi aka rgod (@rgod777) (Both sources)\n*   **Affected Product Versions:** C-More EA9 Programming Software: version 6.78 and prior (certvde.com)\n*   **Disclosure Timeline:** (Zero Day Initiative)\n    *   2024-07-30 - Vulnerability reported to vendor\n    *   2024-12-11 - Coordinated public release of advisory\n*   **Affected Sectors:** Commercial Facilities, Critical Manufacturing, Energy, Water and Wastewater (certvde.com)\n*   **Geographic Deployment:** Worldwide (certvde.com)",

This aligns perfectly with the description of **CWE-787**: \"The product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\"\n\n**CWE-20** is included as a secondary CWE because the root cause is the **lack of validation**. While **CWE-20** is discouraged for general use, it's appropriate here because it highlights the initial failure that led to the more specific **CWE-787**.\n\nI considered other CWEs from the retriever results, such as:\n\n*   **CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow)** and **CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow)**: While buffer overflows are a common consequence of out-of-bounds writes, the description doesn't specify whether the overflow occurs on the heap or stack. Therefore, **CWE-787** is a more accurate representation of the weakness.\n*   **CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read)**: The vulnerability description specifically mentions **memory corruption**, implying a write operation rather than a read.\n\nThe final selection is based on the evidence provided and aims for the most specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability.",
