# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-52804
## Query
Tornado is a Python web framework and asynchronous networking library. The algorithm used for parsing HTTP cookies in Tornado versions prior to 6.4.2 sometimes has quadratic complexity, leading to excessive CPU consumption when parsing maliciously-crafted cookie headers. This parsing occurs in the event loop thread and may block the processing of other requests. Version 6.4.2 fixes the issue.

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: 'quadratic complexity in cookie parsing algorithm'
