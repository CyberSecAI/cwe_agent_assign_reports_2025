## Vulnerability Description
Tornado is a Python web framework and asynchronous networking library. The algorithm used for parsing HTTP cookies in Tornado versions prior to 6.4.2 sometimes has quadratic complexity, leading to excessive CPU consumption when parsing maliciously-crafted cookie headers. This parsing occurs in the event loop thread and may block the processing of other requests. Version 6.4.2 fixes the issue.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **quadratic complexity in cookie parsing algorithm**
- **impact:** excessive CPU consumption
- **vector:** maliciously-crafted cookie headers
- **product:** Tornado
- **version:** prior to 6.4.2

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
```
{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a quadratic time complexity algorithm used in the parsing of HTTP cookies with escaped characters within the Tornado web framework.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption",
      "CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) by sending maliciously crafted cookies to a vulnerable server. This leads to excessive CPU consumption, potentially blocking the event loop and preventing the server from processing other requests.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is network-based. An attacker can send HTTP requests with specially crafted cookie headers to the server.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker requires no special privileges or user interaction to trigger the vulnerability. They only need to be able to send HTTP requests to the server."
