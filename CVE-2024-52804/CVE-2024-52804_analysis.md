# Analysis for CVE-2024-52804

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-407 | Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity | 1.0 | Class | Primary | Allowed-with-Review |
| CWE-400 | Uncontrolled Resource Consumption | 0.7 | Class | Secondary | Discouraged |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-407, which is a Class-level CWE. While it would be preferable to have a Base-level CWE, the nature of the vulnerability being related to an algorithm's complexity makes this a reasonable choice. CWE-400 is a parent of CWE-770 which was listed in the "CVE Reference Links Content Summary".

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **inefficient algorithmic complexity** (CWE-407) in the cookie parsing algorithm. This leads to excessive CPU consumption, which results in a denial-of-service (DoS) due to the server's inability to process other requests (CWE-400).

## Summary of Analysis
The primary vulnerability lies in the **quadratic complexity in the cookie parsing algorithm**, which directly corresponds to CWE-407 (Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity). The vulnerability description key phrases and the CVE reference links content summary both point to this as the root cause. The impact, excessive CPU consumption leading to a denial-of-service, aligns with CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption).

The selection of CWE-407 is further supported by the retriever results, where it is ranked as the top candidate with a score of 0.800. Although CWE-407 is a Class-level CWE, it accurately represents the **algorithmic inefficiency** at the core of the vulnerability. While a more specific Base-level CWE would be ideal, none of the child CWEs of CWE-407 appear to be applicable.

CWE-400 is included as a secondary CWE because the CVE reference links content summary lists it as a weakness. However, I have low confidence in this mapping because CWE-400 is often misused for low-information vulnerability reports and is considered the "technical impact" of vulnerabilities.

The evidence provided in the vulnerability description and CVE reference links content summary is sufficient to support the selection of CWE-407 as the primary CWE and CWE-400 as a secondary CWE.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
An algorithm in a product has an inefficient worst-case computational complexity that may be detrimental to system performance and can be triggered by an attacker, typically using crafted manipulations that ensure that the worst case is being reached.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-784: Reliance on Cookies without Validation and Integrity Checking in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of a cookie, but it does not properly ensure that the cookie is valid for the associated user.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1004: Sensitive Cookie Without 'HttpOnly' Flag
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a cookie to store sensitive information, but the cookie is not marked with the HttpOnly flag.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-208: Observable Timing Discrepancy
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
Two separate operations in a product require different amounts of time to complete, in a way that is observable to an actor and reveals security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-294: Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A capture-replay flaw exists when the design of the product makes it possible for a malicious user to sniff network traffic and bypass authentication by replaying it to the server in question to the same effect as the original message (or with minor changes).

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-799: Improper Control of Interaction Frequency
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly limit the number or frequency of interactions that it has with an actor, such as the number of incoming requests.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-835: Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product contains an iteration or loop with an exit condition that cannot be reached, i.e., an infinite loop.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-617: Reachable Assertion
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product contains an assert() or similar statement that can be triggered by an attacker, which leads to an application exit or other behavior that is more severe than necessary.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check. This can cause the product to perform invalid actions when the resource is in an unexpected state.

**Mapping Guidance**:
