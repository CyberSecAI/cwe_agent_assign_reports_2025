  "description": "A10 Thunder ADC CsrRequestView Command Injection Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of A10 Thunder ADC. Authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the CsrRequestView class. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call**. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of a10user. Was ZDI-CAN-22517.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of CVE-2024-30368:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n- The vulnerability lies within the `CsrRequestView` class of the A10 Thunder ADC's management GUI.\n- The core issue is a lack of proper validation of user-supplied input before it's used in a system call. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a command injection flaw, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code by inserting commands into the vulnerable input.\n- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The system fails to properly sanitize or validate user input before using it to execute system calls.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.\n- **Initial Compromise:**  The attacker gains code execution with the privileges of the `a10user`.\n- **Privilege Escalation:** When chained with CVE-2024-30369, the initial compromise can be used to achieve root privileges on the system.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Network-Based Attack:** This is a remote attack vector, exploitable over the network.\n- **Management GUI:** The vulnerability is located within the management GUI of A10 ACOS.\n- **Specific Class:**  The vulnerability resides specifically in the `CsrRequestView` class.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated with access to the management interface of the A10 system. This means they need to have valid credentials to log in.\n- **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the management interface of the A10 device.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The vulnerability is not exposed via the data plane or the management console/CLI.\n- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 score of 7.2 (High).\n- The vendor (A10 Networks) has released software updates to address this vulnerability.\n- Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative identified and reported this issue.\n\nIn summary, CVE-2024-30368 allows an authenticated attacker with access to the A10 management GUI to inject commands due to insufficient input validation. This leads to remote code execution as `a10user`, which can then be escalated to `root` when combined with CVE-2024-30369.",

This is directly related to the vulnerability description, which states a **lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call**. CWE-78 is a child of CWE-77 ('Command Injection'), which is a more general class. CWE-20 is also related, as it is a class-level weakness describing improper input validation, which is the root cause of the command injection.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    \n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n    cwe78 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe77\n    cwe20 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe78\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe20,cwe77 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied input (CWE-20)**. This leads to **improper neutralization of special elements when the input is used in a system call (CWE-78)**. This results in the ability to **execute arbitrary commands on the system**, leading to remote code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary. The evidence clearly states that the root cause is a **lack of proper validation of user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call**. This directly maps to CWE-78, which is a base-level weakness specifically addressing command injection. The retriever results also support this mapping, with CWE-78 being the top result. CWE-20 is included as a secondary weakness because it represents the underlying issue of improper input validation that leads to the command injection.\n\nThe relationship graph shows that CWE-78 is a child of CWE-77, but CWE-78 is chosen because it is more specific to OS commands. CWE-20 is a class-level weakness, but it is included because it is a contributing factor to the vulnerability.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly address the root cause and contributing factors of the vulnerability. CWE-78 is a base-level weakness, which is the preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities. CWE-20 is a class-level weakness, but it is included because it represents the underlying issue of improper input validation.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n**Not Used:** CWE-74 is too general of an injection issue.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Not Used:** While related to input handling, it doesn't directly address the command injection aspect.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
