# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2025-21972
## Query
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved net mctp unshare packets when reassembling Ensure that the frag_list used for reassembly isnt shared with other packets. This avoids incorrect reassembly when packets are cloned, and prevents a memory leak due to circular references between fragments and their skb_shared_info. The upcoming MCTP-over-USB driver uses skb_clone which can trigger the problem - other MCTP drivers dont share SKBs. A kunit test is added to reproduce the issue.

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: 'circular references between fragments', 'their skb_shared_info'
