This avoids incorrect reassembly when packets are cloned, and prevents a memory leak due to circular references between fragments and their skb_shared_info. The upcoming MCTP-over-USB driver uses skb_clone which can trigger the problem - other MCTP drivers dont share SKBs. A kunit test is added to reproduce the issue. Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-476 CWE-911 CWE-770 CWE-667 CWE-401 CWE-909 CWE-362 CWE-789 CWE-126",
