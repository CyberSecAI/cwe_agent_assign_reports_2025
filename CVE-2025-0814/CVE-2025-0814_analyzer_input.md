## Analysis of Content for CVE-2025-0814

The content is directly related to CVE-2025-0814, as it explicitly mentions the CVE ID and provides details about the vulnerability. It provides more detail than the official CVE description (which is currently a placeholder).

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

Improper Input Validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Improper Input Validation vulnerability in Enerlin’X IFE and eIFE products.
*   Specifically, the vulnerability can cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS) when malicious IEC61850-MMS packets are sent to the device.

**Impact of exploitation:**

Denial-of-Service (DoS) of the network services running on the product. The core functionality of the breaker remains intact during the attack.

**Attack vectors:**

Sending malicious IEC61850-MMS packets to the device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

An attacker needs network access to send packets to the device. No specific privileges are required (PR:N).

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   **Remediation:** Upgrade to version 004.010.000 of Enerlin’X IFE and eIFE. The latest firmware can be installed using the EcoStruxure Power Commission tool: [https://www.se.com/ww/en/product-range/62980-ecostruxure-power-commission/#overview](https://www.se.com/ww/en/product-range/62980-ecostruxure-power-commission/#overview)
*   **Mitigations (if patching is not immediately possible):**
    *   Use the devices only in a protected environment.
    *   Implement network segmentation and a firewall to block unauthorized access to supported ports (see user guide: [https://www.se.com/ww/en/download/document/DOCA0084EN/](https://www.se.com/ww/en/download/document/DOCA0084EN/)).
