  "query": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved media uvcvideo Remove dangling pointers When an async control is written, we copy a pointer to the file handle that started the operation. That pointer will be used when the device is done. Which could be anytime in the future. If the user closes that file descriptor, its structure will be freed, and there will be one dangling pointer per pending async control, that the driver will try to use. Clean all the dangling pointers during release(). To avoid adding a performance penalty in the most common case (no async operation), a counter has been introduced with some logic to make sure that it is properly handled.",
