It is a child of CWE-119, which describes a more general class of buffer overflows. CWE-125 is a secondary weakness, representing the out-of-bounds read that results from the heap buffer overflow.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe122[\"CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    \n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe122 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe125\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe122 primary\n    class cwe125 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **heap buffer overflow (CWE-122)**, which then leads to an **out-of-bounds read (CWE-125)**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly suggests CWE-122 as the primary weakness due to the explicit mention of \"Heap buffer overflow\" in the vulnerability description. The vulnerability description also mentions an \"out of bounds memory read,\" which maps to CWE-125. The retriever results also list CWE-122 and CWE-125 as high-ranking candidates.\n\nThe evidence from the vulnerability description is: \"**Heap buffer overflow** in Tab Strip in Google Chrome prior to 126.0.6478.54 allowed a remote attacker to perform an out of bounds memory read via a crafted HTML page.\"\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the final selection by confirming that CWE-122 is a specific type of buffer overflow (child of CWE-119) and can precede CWE-125 (out-of-bounds read).\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-122 accurately describes the type of buffer overflow (heap-based), and CWE-125 describes the resulting impact (out-of-bounds read).\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-451: User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n**Description**:\nThe user interface (UI) does not properly represent critical information to the user, allowing the information - or its source - to be obscured or spoofed.
