Before 6.3.0, general users can access information that can only be accessed by users with access privileges to admin and support information (SETTINGS_SUPPORT). This is due to inadequate access control for support information (http///storage/get/support/UUID/UUID.zip), and that the UUID is available to general users using an attached query (logs query).
