No authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability before the patch.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n- The code was updated to include a check to ensure that the requesting user's ID matches the ID of the profile picture being requested. If they don't match, the request is denied with a 204 status code.\n- The fix adds `if (response.locals?.user?.id !== Number(id))` to verify the user ID before serving the PFP.\n\nThe content provides more detail than the official CVE description would likely contain, specifically showing the code changes made to address the vulnerability.",

The vulnerability **lacked authorization checks** when serving profile pictures. |\n| CWE-359 | Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor | 0.8 | Base | Allowed | Secondary. An attacker could view profile pictures of users they should not have access to, leading to potential **unauthorized information disclosure**. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary weakness is the **missing authorization** (CWE-862) that leads to the **exposure of private personal information** (CWE-359). CWE-862 is a class-level CWE, and while a more specific base CWE might exist, the provided information centers on the absence of authorization, making it a fitting choice. CWE-359 is a base-level CWE and accurately captures the impact of the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe359[\"CWE-359: Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe359 -->|RESULTING IMPACT| cwe862\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe359 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authorization checks** (CWE-862), allowing an attacker to access other users' profile pictures, which leads to the **exposure of private personal information** (CWE-359).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary cause of the vulnerability is the **lack of authorization checks** when serving profile pictures. This allows users with default permissions to access other users' profile pictures by changing the ID parameter in the user cookie. The fix involves adding a check to ensure that the requesting user's ID matches the ID of the profile picture being requested. This directly addresses the missing authorization issue (CWE-862). The impact of this **missing authorization** is the ability to access other users' profile pictures, which constitutes the **exposure of private personal information** (CWE-359).\n\nThe evidence for these mappings is found in the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\":\n*   \"The code previously allowed access to other users' profile pictures **without proper authorization checks**.\" (Supports CWE-862)\n*   \"An attacker could potentially view profile pictures of users they should not have access to.\" (Supports CWE-359)\n\nCWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) was considered, but the description indicates that the problem was not an incorrect authorization check, but the **absence of any authorization check**. Therefore, CWE-862 is the more appropriate choice.\n\nCWE-359 is at the optimal level of specificity, accurately describing the impact of the **missing authorization**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
