  "description": "Zulip is an open-source team collaboration tool. Zulip supports a configuration where account creation is limited solely by being able to authenticate with a single-sign on authentication backend, meaning the organization places no restrictions on email address domains or invitations being required to join, but has disabled the EmailAuthBackend that is used for email/password authentication. A **bug in the Zulip server** means that it is possible to create an account in such organizations, without having an account with the configured SSO authentication backend. This issue is patched in version 10.2. A workaround includes requiring invitations to join the organization prevents the vulnerability from being accessed.",

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:** No privileges or user interaction are required.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n*   Upgrade to Zulip server version 10.2 or later.\n*   Workaround: Require invitations to join the organization.\n\n**CVSS Score:** 8.2 (High)\n\n**CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N\n\n**Additional Details (compared to a potential official CVE description):**\n\n*   The content provides specific details about the affected software (Zulip Server) and versions.\n*   It clarifies the specific configuration that makes the system vulnerable (relying solely on SSO authentication).\n*   It offers a practical workaround (requiring invitations).\n*   It includes the CVSS score and vector, providing a quantitative measure of the vulnerability's severity.\n*   It details the CVSS base metrics.",

The evidence for this is clear: \"A **bug in the Zulip server** means that it is possible to create an account...without having an account with the configured SSO authentication backend.\" The primary CWE is CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function because it accurately describes the absence of authentication checks for a critical function (account creation).\n\nOther CWEs were considered, but ultimately deemed less appropriate.
