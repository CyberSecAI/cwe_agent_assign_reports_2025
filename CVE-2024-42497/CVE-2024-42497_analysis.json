The product performs an authorization check, but it does not correctly perform the check. |\n| CWE-285 | Improper Authorization | 0.7 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary. The product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action. |\n| CWE-266 | Incorrect Privilege Assignment | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary. A product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\n\nThe primary weakness is CWE-863 [Incorrect Authorization], a Class-level CWE. CWE-863 is more specific than its parent CWE-285 [Improper Authorization], which is a Class-level CWE that could also be considered. CWE-266 [Incorrect Privilege Assignment] is a Base-level CWE and is related to privilege management, which could be a contributing factor.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe266[\"CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\"]\n    \n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe285 secondary\n    class cwe266 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **failure to properly enforce permissions**. This leads to a user with read-only access being able to perform write operations.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe primary CWE is CWE-863 [Incorrect Authorization] because the vulnerability description states that the system **fails to properly enforce permissions**. This means that there is an authorization check, but it is not working correctly. CWE-285 [Improper Authorization] is a more general CWE that could also be used, but CWE-863 [Incorrect Authorization] is more specific and, therefore, a better fit. CWE-266 [Incorrect Privilege Assignment] could also be considered because the vulnerability involves a user with a system manager role with read-only access being able to perform write operations, but it's less direct than CWE-863. The **rootcause** is the **failure to properly enforce permissions**.\n\nThe guidance on privileges vs permissions helped guide the selection, but in this case the distinction is blurred as the **failure to properly enforce permissions** encompasses both privileges and permissions.\n\nI am selecting CWE-863 as the primary CWE because it best matches the **rootcause** described in the vulnerability description.",
