## Vulnerability Description
SFTPGo is a full-featured and highly configurable SFTP, HTTP/S, FTP/S and WebDAV server - S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob. One powerful feature of SFTPGo is the ability to have the EventManager execute scripts or run applications in response to certain events. This feature is very common in all software similar to SFTPGo and is generally unrestricted. However, any SFTPGo administrator with permission to run a script has access to the underlying OS/container with the same permissions as the user running SFTPGo. This is unexpected for some SFTPGo administrators who think that there is a clear distinction between accessing the system shell and accessing the SFTPGo WebAdmin UI. To avoid this confusion, running system commands is disabled by default in 2.6.3, and an allow list has been added so that system administrators configuring SFTPGo must explicitly define which commands are allowed to be configured from the WebAdmin UI.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **unrestricted access to underlying OS/container**
- **impact:** access to underlying OS/container and execute scripts
- **attacker:** SFTPGo administrator with permission to run a script
- **product:** SFTPGo
- **version:** before 2.6.3
- **component:** EventManager

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2024-52309:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the unrestricted ability of the SFTPGo EventManager to execute system commands.
-  Prior to the fix, any SFTPGo administrator with the permission to configure event-triggered scripts could execute arbitrary system commands with the same privileges as the SFTPGo process, potentially gaining access to the underlying OS, database, and server configurations. This was due to the lack of restrictions on which commands could be executed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Unrestricted Command Execution:** The primary weakness is that the EventManager did not have any restrictions on the system commands it could execute.
- **Lack of Privilege Separation:** SFTPGo administrators with web UI access had the potential to gain OS-level access through the EventManager, blurring the expected separation of privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **System Compromise:** An attacker (SFTPGo admin) could execute arbitrary commands on the underlying OS, potentially leading to a full system compromise.
- **Data Breach:** By accessing the OS and database, attackers could potentially steal sensitive information from the SFTPGo instance or connected systems.
- **Configuration Tampering:** Attackers could modify server configurations, leading to denial of service or other malicious outcomes.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **SFTPGo WebAdmin UI:** The vulnerability is exploited through the EventManager configuration in the SFTPGo web administration interface.
- **Event-Triggered Actions:** Attackers would configure event actions to execute arbitrary system commands.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **SFTPGo Administrator Access:** The attacker needs to have administrative privileges to configure event actions through the SFTPGo web interface.

**Mitigation:**

- The vulnerability was patched by:
  - **Disabling command execution by default**: System commands execution is disabled by default.
  - **Implementing an allow list:**  The fix introduces an allow list for system commands. Administrators now have to explicitly specify which commands are allowed in the configurations.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided content includes commit details ([88b1850](https://github.com/drakkan/sftpgo/commit/88b1850b5806eee81150873d4e565144b21021fb) and [b524da1](https://github.com/drakkan/sftpgo/commit/b524da11e9466d05fe03304713ee1c61bb276ec4)) which demonstrate the code changes made to address this vulnerability.
- The advisory highlights the confusion that could arise from administrators assuming that web UI access was separate from shell access.
- The fix ensures that administrators are aware of the implications of configuring event-triggered actions, as they need to explicitly define the commands that are allowed.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* 🔍 *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* 🔍 *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion – CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### 🔸 CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ✅ *“A user created with the ‘guest’ role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ✅ *“The backup service runs as root but only needs read access.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ⚠️ This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### 🔸 CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ✅ *“User can access another user’s invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.”*

## Mapping Examples – Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *“User can escalate privileges to admin.”*
> ❌ Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged – only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ✅ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**

* ✅ **CWE-250**: *“Installer runs with system-level privileges but doesn't require them to install files in the user directory.”*
* ✅ **CWE-284**: *“Inconsistent access rules between UI and backend for sensitive endpoints.”*
* ✅ **CWE-285**: *“Authorization logic fails to restrict access to finance reports based on department.”*
