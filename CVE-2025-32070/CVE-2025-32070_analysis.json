  "reference_content": "## CVE-2025-32070 Analysis\n\nThe provided content relates to CVE-2025-32070. Here's an extraction of relevant information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from a lack of escaping of various interface messages within the AJAXPoll extension.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nThe vulnerability allows for the injection of XSS payloads when a vulnerable system message (e.g., `ajaxpoll-no-vote-results-after-voting`) is set to malicious content and then rendered within a `<poll>` tag.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n1.  Set a vulnerable system message to an XSS payload.\n2.  Render a `<poll>` that displays the modified message.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\nThe attacker needs the ability to set system messages to arbitrary values.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\nThe vulnerability was addressed by escaping various interface messages in the AJAXPoll extension.  The fix was implemented across multiple branches (REL1\\_42, REL1\\_39, REL1\\_43, and master) via Gerrit changes 1130013, 1130014, 1130015, and 1130016. The patch is available as `T389590.patch`.\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   The vulnerable code location is identified as `includes/AJAXPoll.php#415` in the AJAXPoll extension.\n*   The task was initially created by BlankEclair on March 21, 2025, and resolved on March 24, 2025.\n*   The fix was merged by jenkins-bot.\n*   The issue is related to task T382326, which involves a release announcement for security patches.",

CWE-20 is a high-level class that describes the general problem of **improper input validation**, while CWE-79 is a base-level CWE that specifies the type of weakness which is Cross-Site Scripting. Thus, CWE-20 can be a parent of CWE-79.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    \n    cwe79 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe79 primary\n    class cwe20 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper input validation** (CWE-20), which leads to the generation of a web page containing un-neutralized input, resulting in Cross-Site Scripting (CWE-79).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-79 as the most relevant due to the explicit mention of \"Cross-Site Scripting\" in the vulnerability description. The subsequent step was to identify the root cause of the vulnerability. Since the vulnerability description mentions \"**Improper Input Validation vulnerability**\", CWE-20 was considered.\n\nThe final decision was to assign CWE-79 as the primary CWE, because it directly reflects the vulnerability, and CWE-20 as a secondary CWE, as it captures the root cause. This decision is supported by the vulnerability description, which explicitly states that the **input validation vulnerability** leads to **Cross-Site Scripting**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
