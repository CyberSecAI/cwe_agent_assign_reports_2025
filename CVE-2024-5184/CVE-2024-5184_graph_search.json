Attackers can exploit the issue by forcing the AI service to leak the standard hard-coded system prompts and/or execute unwanted prompts. When engaging with EmailGPT by submitting a malicious prompt that requests harmful information, the system will respond by providing the requested data. This vulnerability can be exploited by any individual with access to the service. Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-1336 CWE-95 CWE-472 CWE-94 CWE-427 CWE-1426 CWE-359 CWE-1427 CWE-74",
