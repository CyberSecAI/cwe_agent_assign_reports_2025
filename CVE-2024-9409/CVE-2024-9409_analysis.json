While CWE-770 is more specific, the provided vulnerability description doesn't explicitly state that resources are being allocated *without limits or throttling*. It only mentions that **uncontrolled resource consumption** leads to the device becoming unresponsive when a large amount of IGMP packets is present.

It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).\n\n**Technical Explanation:**\n\n*   **CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption:** The vulnerability description explicitly states the existence of an **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption** vulnerability. The device doesn't properly manage resources when handling a large number of IGMP packets. This leads to resource exhaustion, causing the device to become unresponsive and lose communication.\n    *   **Security Implications and Potential Impact:** This can lead to a denial-of-service condition, preventing legitimate users from accessing the device and its functionalities.\n    *   **Relationship:** CWE-400 is a class-level CWE. It's often a parent to more specific resource management issues.\n    *   **Mapping Guidance:** While the usage is \"Discouraged,\" the rationale suggests it is misused when conflated with technical impact. In this case, the vulnerability description clearly identifies **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption** as the **weakness**, not just an impact. Therefore, using CWE-400 is appropriate here.\n    *   **Evidence:** \"An **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption** vulnerability exists that could cause the device to become unresponsive resulting in communication loss when a large amount of IGMP packets is present in the network.\"\n\n*   **CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling:** The product allocates resources without imposing any restrictions on the size or number of resources that can be allocated.\n    *   **Security Implications and Potential Impact:** Attackers can exhaust available resources, leading to a denial-of-service condition.\n    *   **Relationship:** CWE-770 is a Base-level CWE and a child of CWE-400.\n    *   **Mapping Guidance:** The usage is \"Allowed.\"\n    *   **Rationale for not selecting:** It could be a more specific variant of CWE-400, but there isn't explicit information to support that the resources are allocated \"without limits or throttling\", only that the resource consumption is uncontrolled.\n\n**CWEs Considered But Not Used:**\n\n*   CWE-410: Insufficient Resource Pool - While related to resource consumption, the description focuses on the resource pool *not being large enough*, rather than *uncontrolled consumption*.\n*   CWE-772: Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime - The description doesn't explicitly state that resources are not being released.\n*   CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value - The description doesn't specify that memory allocation is the issue, only that resources are being consumed in an uncontrolled manner.\n*   CWE-1176: Inefficient CPU Computation - The description doesn't explicitly state that inefficient computation is the cause.",
