CWE-863 is a child of CWE-285, \"Improper Authorization,\" which is a more general category. Since we have evidence that the authorization is present, but implemented incorrectly, we chose CWE-863.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe285 secondary\n    class cwe284 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **improper authorization** implementation. Any authenticated user can access all reports and their associated data via the API, bypassing intended access controls. This leads to unauthorized access to sensitive report data.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on the **improper authorization** flaw described in the vulnerability. The key phrase \"authorization flaw exists...can access all reports...bypasses intended access controls\" strongly suggests an authorization issue rather than an authentication problem. The retriever results listed CWE-285 and CWE-863 as potential candidates.\n\nThe decision to select CWE-863 over CWE-285 is based on the fact that the authorization check exists, but it's performed incorrectly. The vulnerability description indicates that intended access controls exist but are bypassed. If there were no authorization checks at all, CWE-862 \"Missing Authorization\" would be more appropriate. The specificity of CWE-863 makes it a better fit than the more general CWE-285.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately reflect the nature of the vulnerability, which is an **incorrect authorization** implementation that leads to unauthorized access to sensitive data.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
