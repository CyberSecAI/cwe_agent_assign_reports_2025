This lack of security headers makes the application vulnerable to a wide array of attacks.\\n- **Impact of exploitation**: If XSS filters are bypassed, the absence of security headers exposes the application to a variety of attacks, including cross-site scripting (XSS), clickjacking, and other client-side vulnerabilities. There is potential for unauthorized access to data, data modification, and service disruption.\\n- **Attack vectors**: Network based attacks through exploiting the lack of security headers in the server response.\\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not require any privileges. User interaction is required in the form of the victim visiting a malicious link or website.\\n\\nThe provided content gives more detail than the official CVE description, outlining the specific

Starting in version 0.1.0 and prior to version 0.3.5, the productions server appeared to have been misconfigured and missed providing any content security policy or security headers. This could result in bypassing of **cross-site scripting** filters. Version 0.3.5 fixed the issue.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## WEAKNESS: 'cross-site scripting'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this WEAKNESS:\n\n### 1.
