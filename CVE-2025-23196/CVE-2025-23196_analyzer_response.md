# Raw Analyzer Response for CVE-2025-23196

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-78 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') | 1.0 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-94 | Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection') | 0.7 | Base | Secondary | Allowed-with-Review |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that influenced my decision was the hierarchical one. CWE-78 is a child of CWE-77 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command), which in turn is a child of CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')). The choice of CWE-78 reflects a desire to be as specific as possible, given the evidence.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **improper neutralization** of special elements in the script filename field, leading to **OS command injection**, which then results in arbitrary shell command execution and remote code execution.
  - Root Cause: **Improper Neutralization**
  - Weakness: **OS Command Injection**
  - Impact: Arbitrary shell command execution and remote code execution

## Summary of Analysis
The vulnerability is a **code injection** issue where authenticated users can inject and execute arbitrary shell commands due to **improper neutralization** of special elements in the script filename field. The field is executed using `sh -c`, allowing for command injection.

The primary CWE is CWE-78, as the vulnerability involves the injection of OS commands. CWE-94, **code injection**, was considered because the vulnerability is described as a **code injection** issue. However, CWE-78 is more specific because it directly addresses the injection of OS commands, while CWE-94 is more general.

The evidence for CWE-78 is strong. The vulnerability description states that the script filename field is executed using `sh -c`, which allows for injecting malicious commands that lead to remote code execution. This aligns directly with the description of CWE-78, which involves **improper neutralization** of special elements used in an OS command.

The selection of CWE-78 is at the optimal level of specificity because it accurately captures the nature of the vulnerability and is a Base-level CWE.

I considered CWE-94 "Improper Control of Generation of Code ('**Code Injection**')" because the description refers to a "**code injection** vulnerability". However, the root cause is more precisely an OS command injection, making CWE-78 a better fit. CWE-94 is also marked as "Allowed-with-Review", indicating that it can be misused if a more specific CWE is available. I am including it as a secondary CWE because the vulnerability description specifically calls out **code injection**.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.

## CWE-917: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of an expression language (EL) statement in a framework such as a Java Server Page (JSP) using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended EL statement before it is executed.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-88: Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs a string for a command to be executed by a separate component
in another control sphere, but it does not properly delimit the
intended arguments, options, or switches within that command string.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-95: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes code syntax before using the input in a dynamic evaluation call (e.g. "eval").

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as "<", ">", and "&" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-93: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.71

The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate
