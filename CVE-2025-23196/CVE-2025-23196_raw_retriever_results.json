  "query": "A code injection vulnerability exists in the Ambari Alert Definition feature, allowing authenticated users to inject and execute arbitrary shell commands. The vulnerability arises when defining alert scripts, where the script filename field is executed using `sh -c`. An attacker with authenticated access can exploit this vulnerability to inject malicious commands, leading to remote code execution on the server. The issue has been fixed in the latest versions of Ambari.",
