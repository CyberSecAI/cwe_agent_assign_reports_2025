  "reference_content": "The provided content discusses a SQL injection vulnerability in the \"SourceCodester Apartment Visitor Management System V1.0\". Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\n*   The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper cleaning or validation of user input from the `searchdata` parameter in the `/search-result.php` file. This allows attackers to inject malicious code directly into SQL queries.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   SQL injection\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   Unauthorized database access\n*   Sensitive data leakage\n*   Data tampering\n*   Comprehensive system control\n*   Service interruption\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   The `searchdata` parameter in the `/search-result.php` file is the attack vector.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   No login or authorization is required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   Use prepared statements and parameter binding.\n*   Implement input validation and filtering.\n*   Minimize database user permissions.\n*   Conduct regular security audits.\n\n**Payload examples:**\n\n*   **Boolean-based blind:** `searchdata=-4263' OR 6069=6069-- Zqay&search=`\n*   **Time-based blind:** `searchdata=111111111111' AND (SELECT 2338 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))OtCn)-- EExH&search=`\n*   **UNION query:** `searchdata=111111111111' UNION ALL SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,CONCAT(0x7178717a71,0x6247536e794c625a524c6d666c505a70634f664d6d7874666a46427a474857526c6a54514c4f7447,0x71707a6271),NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL-- -&search=`\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n*   The content provides more detail than a typical CVE description, including specific payloads and screenshots of sqlmap output.\n*   Vulnerable File: `/search-result.php`\n*   Version: V1.0\n*   Software Link: [https://www.sourcecodester.com/sites/default/files/download/oretnom23/php-avms_0.zip](https://www.sourcecodester.com/sites/default/files/download/oretnom23/php-avms_0.zip)",

There are no child or parent relationships that necessitate a change in the selection, as CWE-89 is already a Base level CWE, and accurately reflects the **SQL Injection** vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe89 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Improper Neutralization** of user-supplied input (`searchdata`) in `/search-result.php`. This is represented by CWE-89.\n2.  **Impact:** **SQL Injection**, leading to potential unauthorized database access, sensitive data leakage, data tampering, comprehensive system control, and service interruption.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis strongly points to CWE-89 as the primary weakness. The **Vulnerability Description** key phrases mention \"**SQL Injection**\". The **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** confirms the **root cause** is due to \"lack of proper cleaning or validation of user input from the `searchdata` parameter\" leading to **SQL Injection**. The **Retriever Results** also list CWE-89 as the top match. All these factors reinforce the selection of CWE-89.\n\nThe selection of CWE-89 is at the optimal level of specificity because it is a Base level CWE that directly addresses the **root cause** of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.
