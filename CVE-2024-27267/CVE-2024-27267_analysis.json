Matches the **race condition** in the ORB listener threads. |\n| CWE-400 | Uncontrolled Resource Consumption | 0.6 | Class | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The **race condition** leads to a denial of service, which is a form of resource consumption. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.75\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-362, which is a Class-level CWE. CWE-400 is a parent of CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling). The relationship analysis helped to identify that the **race condition** (CWE-362) can lead to uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400), causing a denial of service.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    cwe362 -->|CANLEADTO| cwe400\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe362 primary\n    class cwe400 secondary\n    class cwe770 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **race condition** in the management of ORB listener threads (CWE-362). This **race condition** leads to uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400), which then results in a remote denial of service.\n  - CWE-362 (Root Cause): Improper synchronization in concurrent execution.\n  - CWE-400 (Impact): Uncontrolled resource consumption leading to denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is a **race condition** (CWE-362) in the management of ORB listener threads. This leads to a denial of service due to uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400). The evidence is based on the vulnerability description and the provided CVE Reference Links Content Summary. The graph relationships helped to visualize the connection between the **race condition** and the denial of service.\n\nThe selection of CWE-362 is based on the vulnerability description stating a **race condition**. The selection of CWE-400 is based on the impact, which is a denial of service.
