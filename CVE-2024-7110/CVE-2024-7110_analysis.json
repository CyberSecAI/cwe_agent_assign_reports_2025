  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n\n- The vulnerability stems from a prompt injection flaw in the \"Resolve Vulnerability\" feature of GitLab. This feature uses an LLM to generate code patches for reported vulnerabilities. The LLM's prompt is constructed using data from SAST (Static Application Security Testing) reports. Attackers can inject malicious instructions into the LLM prompt by crafting a malicious SAST report, specifically by manipulating the \"name\" field within a vulnerability identifier.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n- **Prompt Injection:** The core vulnerability is the lack of sanitization or validation of user-controlled data (from SAST reports) that is used to build the prompt for the LLM. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary instructions into the prompt.\n- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The system does not sanitize the `name` field of the SAST report's identifier, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary text, including malicious commands.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can inject instructions into the LLM prompt that will be included in the generated merge request and its associated pipeline. This allows them to execute arbitrary code within the context of the victim's CI pipeline.\n- **Credentials Exposure:** In the example provided, the attacker injects code to print the `$CI_JOB_TOKEN` to the job log, potentially exposing sensitive information.\n- **Supply Chain Attack Potential:** This could be used to compromise victim environments through a manipulated SAST report, creating a supply chain vulnerability.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n- **Malicious SAST Report:** The primary attack vector is crafting a specially crafted SAST report. This report is uploaded via a fake SAST job in a GitLab CI pipeline.\n- **\"Resolve Vulnerability\" Feature:** The victim must use the \"Resolve Vulnerability\" feature on the vulnerable finding.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n- **Ability to Create a SAST Report:** The attacker needs to be able to create and submit a SAST report, which typically requires them to be a contributor to the vulnerable project.\n- **Access to CI Configuration:** They need to be able to define a CI configuration that generates the SAST report and uploads it as an artifact.\n- **Victim Interaction:** The victim must use the \"Resolve Vulnerability\" feature. This can be triggered by any user who has rights to view vulnerabilities and create MRs.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n- The provided content includes a full, executable example with a proof of concept.\n- The example shows a malicious CI config that includes the injected instructions, but the attacker is able to inject other malicious code.\n- The vulnerability is present in how the LLM is being prompted, the injection is happening in the step of creating the prompt based on the parsed SAST report.",

The vulnerability involves injecting code via a prompt into an LLM, which then generates code, making CWE-94 a relevant consideration. However, the description highlights that the injection happens during prompt creation, which is then used by a downstream component (the LLM) to generate the code. This points towards CWE-74, but it's a Class level CWE and therefore less specific. CWE-94 is considered because the ultimate impact is code injection.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n    \n    cwe94 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe74 primary\n    class cwe94 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the attacker crafting a malicious SAST report. The `name` field within the SAST report is not sanitized (**lack of input sanitization**), allowing the attacker to inject malicious instructions into the LLM prompt (**Prompt Injection**). The LLM, using the injected instructions, generates malicious code that is then executed in the victim's pipeline (**Arbitrary Code Execution**).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment considered CWE-94 (Improper Control of Generation of Code) due to the arbitrary code execution impact. However, after carefully reviewing the vulnerability description and reference links content summary, it became clear that the root cause is the **improper neutralization** of special elements in the prompt used by the LLM (a downstream component). The injected code is not directly executed but used to generate code. Therefore, the primary weakness is CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')), even though it's discouraged. CWE-94 is still considered a secondary factor because of the resulting code execution, but the injection itself is the more direct cause.\n\nThe selection is based on the provided evidence, particularly the description of the prompt injection and the flow of data from the SAST report to the LLM. The graph relationships helped to understand the connection between injection vulnerabilities and their potential consequences. I overrode the general mapping guidance discouraging the use of CWE-74 because of the specific nature of the prompt injection impacting a downstream component.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-88: Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs a string for a command to be executed by a separate component\nin another control sphere, but it does not properly delimit the\nintended arguments, options, or switches within that command string.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1286: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input that is expected to be well-formed - i.e., to comply with a certain syntax - but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input complies with the syntax.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-93: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses CRLF (carriage return line feeds) as a special element, e.g. to separate lines or records, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CRLF sequences from inputs.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
