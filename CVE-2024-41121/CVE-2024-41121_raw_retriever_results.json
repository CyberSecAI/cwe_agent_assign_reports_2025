Those workflows can either lead to a host takeover that runs the agent executing the workflow. 2. Or allow to extract the secrets who would be normally provided to the plugins whos entrypoint are overwritten. This issue has been addressed in release version 2.7.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",
