  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from the ability to manipulate the workspace base path for plugins, specifically the `plugins/docker` image, allowing an attacker to overwrite the plugin's entrypoint and gain code execution in the privileged container or leak secrets.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n1.  **Unrestricted Workspace Base Path:** The server allowed users to define a custom workspace base path that is then mounted into the plugin container.\n2.  **Privileged Container Execution:**  The `plugins/docker` image, runs in privileged mode, which is necessary for building docker images within the CI environment but also opens the door for this type of attack.\n3.  **Insufficient Input Validation:** The system only checked if \"Commands\" and \"Entrypoint\" were unset before allowing the container to run in privileged mode using the \"IsPlugin\" function, but not the workspace configuration.\n4.  **Secret Leakage:** By overwriting the entrypoint of a plugin, an attacker could extract secrets intended for the plugin that were normally provided through environment variables.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n1.  **Host Takeover:** An attacker can gain code execution inside the privileged container, potentially leading to a host takeover of the agent executing the workflow.\n2.  **Secret Exfiltration:** An attacker can extract secrets provided to plugins by overwriting the entrypoint and dumping environment variables to the logs which can contain sensitive information.\n3.  **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can run arbitrary commands on the agent machine by replacing the original plugin's entrypoint with a malicious one.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n1.  **Workflow Configuration Manipulation:** An attacker crafts a malicious workflow YAML file with a custom workspace base path that is designed to overwrite the `plugins/docker` entrypoint.\n2. **User Creation:** The server allowed any user to trigger a pipeline, if an attacker can get access to a user on the system they can trigger a malicious pipeline run.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n1.  **Access to a User Account:** An attacker needs a valid user account on the Woodpecker CI server to create or modify pipelines or a \"gated\" repo feature bypass.\n2.  **Knowledge of Workflow Syntax:** An attacker needs to be familiar with the Woodpecker CI workflow syntax to manipulate the `workspace` and `steps` configurations.\n3.  **Understanding of the Vulnerability:** The attacker needs knowledge of the plugin execution model and the privileged nature of the `plugins/docker` image.\n\n**Additional Information**\n\n- The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.7.0.\n- A workaround was to enable the \"gated\" repo feature and review each change upfront.\n- The pull request [#3933](https://github.com/woodpecker-ci/woodpecker/pull/3933) addresses the vulnerability.\n- The vulnerability is tracked as CVE-2024-41121.\n- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 score of 8.8.",

This allows the attacker to overwrite the plugins/docker entrypoint with a malicious entrypoint. |\n| CWE-770 | Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate: The product does not properly restrict the amount of resources that are allocated, or it does not properly implement throttling. This allows the attacker to cause a denial of service. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-73, which describes external control of file names or paths. The secondary CWE is CWE-770, which is related to allocation of resources without limits or throttling. CWE-73 is a base-level CWE, providing a specific description of the vulnerability.

Then, the attacker overwrites the plugins/docker entrypoint with a malicious entrypoint. This leads to CWE-770, where the product does not properly restrict the amount of resources that are allocated, or it does not properly implement throttling.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-73 as the primary vulnerability because the **root cause** of the vulnerability is due to external control of file names or paths. The system only checked if \"Commands\" and \"Entrypoint\" were unset before allowing the container to run in privileged mode using the \"IsPlugin\" function, but not the workspace configuration. This allows an attacker to craft a malicious workflow YAML file with a custom workspace base path that is designed to overwrite the `plugins/docker` entrypoint. The retriever results provided several candidate CWEs, but CWE-73 was the most relevant based on the vulnerability description and the root cause analysis. The relationship graph also supports this decision, as CWE-73 can precede other vulnerabilities, such as CWE-770. The final selection of CWE-73 is at the optimal level of specificity because it is a base-level CWE that accurately describes the weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n\n\n## CWE-88: Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs a string for a command to be executed by a separate component\nin another control sphere, but it does not properly delimit the\nintended arguments, options, or switches within that command string.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1286: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input that is expected to be well-formed - i.e., to comply with a certain syntax - but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input complies with the syntax.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.

It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.\n\n\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 1315.82\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses\n\n\n## CWE Relationship Analysis\n\nCurrent CWEs represent these abstraction levels: .\n\n\n### Vulnerability Chain Analysis\n\n**Chain starting from CWE-116:**\n- 116 (Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output) - ROOT\n\n\n**Chain starting from CWE-770:**\n- 770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) - ROOT\n\n\n\n### CWE Relationship Diagram\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n```",
