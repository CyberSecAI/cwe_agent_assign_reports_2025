  "query": "A vulnerability in the protocol handlers of Cisco Webex App could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to gain access to sensitive information. This vulnerability exists because the affected application does not safely handle file protocol handlers. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to follow a link that is designed to cause the application to send requests. If the attacker can observe transmitted traffic in a privileged network position, a successful exploit could allow the attacker to capture sensitive information, including credential information, from the requests.",
