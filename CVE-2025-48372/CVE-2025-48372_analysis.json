  "description": "Schule is open-source school management system software. The generateOTP() function generates a 4-digit numeric One-Time Password (OTP). Prior to version 1.0.1, even if a secure random number generator is used, the short length and limited range (10009999) results in only 9000 possible combinations. This small keyspace makes the OTP highly vulnerable to brute-force attacks, especially in the absence of strong rate-limiting or lockout mechanisms. Version 1.0.1 fixes the issue.",

It provides more detail than the placeholder CVE description.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe `generateOTP()` function generates a 4-digit numeric One-Time Password (OTP). This results in a small keyspace of only 9000 possible combinations.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Short OTP length (4 digits).\n*   Limited range of OTP values (1000-9999).\n*   Vulnerability to brute-force attacks due to the small keyspace.\n*   Lack of strong rate-limiting or lockout mechanisms (mentioned as exacerbating the issue).\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nSuccessful brute-force attacks against the OTP could allow unauthorized access to user accounts.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Brute-force attacks targeting the OTP generation endpoint.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   An attacker needs to be able to repeatedly request OTPs and attempt to guess the correct code.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   Increase the length of the OTP to create a larger keyspace. The code was updated to generate 7-digit OTPs (`rand(1000000, 9999999)`).\n*   Implement strong rate-limiting to prevent attackers from making too many requests in a short period.\n*   Implement account lockout mechanisms after a certain number of failed OTP attempts.",

This leads to the vulnerability being susceptible to brute-force attacks. The absence of rate-limiting (CWE-307) exacerbates the problem, making it easier for attackers to try multiple OTPs in a short period.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is the **small space of random values** (CWE-334) used for generating OTPs. The vulnerability description explicitly states that the short length and limited range of the OTP results in a small keyspace, making it vulnerable to brute-force attacks. This aligns directly with the description of CWE-334. The absence of rate-limiting (CWE-307) exacerbates the problem, making it easier for attackers to try multiple OTPs in a short period.\n\nThe selection of CWE-334 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability: the limited range of possible OTP values. While CWE-330 is a parent class, CWE-334 provides a more precise description of the weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
