  "description": "Hubble is a fully distributed networking and security observability platform for cloud native workloads. Prior to version 1.17.2, a network attacker could inject malicious control characters into Hubble CLI terminal output, potentially leading to loss of integrity and manipulation of the output. This could be leveraged to conceal log entries, rewrite output, or even make the terminal temporarily unusable. Exploitation of this attack would require the victim to be monitoring Kafka traffic using Layer 7 Protocol Visibility at the time of the attack. The issue is patched in Hubble CLI v1.17.2. Hubble CLI users who are unable to upgrade can direct their Hubble flows to a log file and inspect the output within a text editor.",

CWE-20 is a broader, less specific classification, representing **improper input validation**. CWE-117 is a `Base` level CWE while CWE-20 is a `Class` level CWE. No direct parent-child or chain relationships significantly influenced the selection, though CWE-117 can be seen as a specific instance of the broader input validation issues that CWE-20 covers. The choice of CWE-117 is favored for its precision in describing the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe117[\"CWE-117: Improper Output Neutralization for Logs\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    \n    cwe117 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe117 primary\n    class cwe20 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the network attacker **injecting malicious control characters** (root cause) into the Hubble CLI terminal output. Because the output is not properly neutralized, this leads to **manipulation of the output**, **concealment of log entries**, **rewriting of output**, and a **temporarily unusable terminal** (impact). The chain is: Character Injection -> **Improper Output Neutralization** -> Output Manipulation/Concealment/Terminal Unusability.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified the core issue as a failure to properly sanitize output, leading to potential manipulation of the terminal display.\n\nThe primary evidence supporting CWE-117 comes from the vulnerability description: \"a network attacker could **inject malicious control characters** into Hubble CLI terminal output, potentially leading to **loss of integrity and manipulation of the output**.\" The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also states the root cause is that \"a network attacker could **inject malicious control characters** into Hubble CLI terminal output\" and notes the \"lack of proper sanitization of input before displaying it in the terminal.\" This evidence indicates that the Hubble CLI does not properly neutralize or sanitize output before displaying it, allowing an attacker to inject control characters that can manipulate the terminal.\n\nCWE-117 is the most specific and appropriate choice because it directly addresses the **improper neutralization of output** in logs.\n\nCWE-20 was considered because it relates to input validation, but it is too broad. While the injected characters are technically input, the core weakness is in the **lack of proper output handling**, making CWE-117 a more precise fit. The final selection is strongly influenced by the evidence of **malicious control character injection** and the resulting **output manipulation**. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-117 providing a focused description of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-88: Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs a string for a command to be executed by a separate component\nin another control sphere, but it does not properly delimit the\nintended arguments, options, or switches within that command string.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
