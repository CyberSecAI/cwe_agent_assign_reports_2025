## Vulnerability Description
server.c in Neat VNC (aka neatvnc) before 0.8.1 does not properly validate the security type, a related issue to CVE-2006-2369.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **product:** Neat VNC (aka neatvnc)
- **version:** before 0.8.1
- **component:** server.c

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability in Neat VNC:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stemmed from a lack of proper validation of the security type chosen by the client during the VNC handshake process. Specifically, the server did not check if the client-selected security type was allowed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** The primary weakness was that a malicious VNC client could specify `RFB_SECURITY_TYPE_NONE`, even if the server was configured to require authentication. This allowed a client to bypass authentication entirely, gaining unauthorized access to the VNC server.
- **Missing Input Validation:**  The vulnerability existed because there was no check on the allowed security types before processing the security message. The server's `on_security_message` function directly processed the client provided security type without validating it against what the server allows.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** Successful exploitation would grant an attacker complete, unauthenticated access to the VNC server, including the ability to view and control the desktop.
- **Full System Compromise:** Depending on the privileges of the VNC server, this could potentially lead to full system compromise and further malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Connection:** An attacker would need to establish a network connection to the vulnerable VNC server.
- **Malicious VNC Client:** The attacker would need a modified or malicious VNC client to specify the `RFB_SECURITY_TYPE_NONE` when connecting, even when the server should require other authentication methods.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Reachability:** The attacker must be able to reach the VNC server over the network.
- **Modified VNC Client:** The attacker needs to be able to control the security type sent by the client application.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix for the vulnerability includes an `is_allowed_security_type()` check that verifies the client-chosen security type against a list of server-allowed security types before proceeding. This prevents clients from arbitrarily selecting "None" as the security type.
- The fix also increased the buffer size for the security types and refactored the code related to adding allowed security types with an `ADD_SECURITY_TYPE()` macro to avoid an out-of-bounds write bug. While this was a bug fix, the primary vulnerability was due to the lack of authentication type validation.
