SuiteCRM relies on the blacklist of functions/methods to prevent installation of malicious MLPs. But this checks can be bypassed with some syntax constructions. SuiteCRM uses token_get_all to parse PHP scripts and check the resulted AST against blacklists. But it doesnt take into account all scenarios.
