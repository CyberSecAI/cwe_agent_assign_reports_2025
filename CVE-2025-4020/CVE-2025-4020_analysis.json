The root cause lies in the fact that attackers can inject malicious code via the parameter \"fname\". This input is then directly utilized in SQL queries without undergoing proper sanitization or validation processes.\n\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities present:\n* SQL injection\n\nImpact of exploitation:\n* Exploiting this SQL injection vulnerability allows attackers to gain unauthorized access to the database, cause sensitive data leakage, tamper with data, gain complete control over the system, and even disrupt services.\n\nAttack vectors:\n* The \"fname\" parameter in the \"/contact.php\" file.\n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position:\n* No login or authorization is required to exploit this vulnerability\n\nMitigation or fix:\n* Employ prepared statements and parameter binding.\n* Conduct input validation and filtering.\n```",
