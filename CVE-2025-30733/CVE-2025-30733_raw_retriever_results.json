  "query": "Vulnerability in the RDBMS Listener component of Oracle Database Server. Supported versions that are affected are 19.3-19.26, 21.3-21.17 and 23.4-23.7. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via Oracle Net to compromise RDBMS Listener. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized access to critical data or complete access to all RDBMS Listener accessible data.
