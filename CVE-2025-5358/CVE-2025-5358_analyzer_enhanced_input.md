## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-5358 Content

The provided content **RELATES** to a vulnerability, but it is not directly tied to a CVE with ID CVE-2025-5358 as the CVE description is a placeholder. It details a SQL injection vulnerability in the "campcodes Cybercafe Management System V1.0".  The content provides more detail than a typical CVE description.

Here's a breakdown of the extracted information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   A SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `/bwdates-reports-details.php` file due to insufficient user input validation of the `fromdate` parameter. Malicious code injected through this parameter is directly used in SQL queries without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   SQL Injection

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Unauthorized database access
*   Sensitive data leakage
*   Data tampering
*   System control
*   Service interruption

**Attack vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is exploitable via the `fromdate` parameter in a POST request to `/bwdates-reports-details.php`.
*   No login or authorization is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to send a crafted POST request to the vulnerable endpoint. No authentication is required.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   **Use prepared statements and parameter binding:** This separates SQL code from user input.
*   **Input validation and filtering:**  Strictly validate and filter user input.
*   **Minimize database user permissions:** Use accounts with the least necessary privileges.
*   **Regular security audits:** Conduct regular code and system security audits.

**Payload Example:**

```
Parameter: fromdate (POST)
    Type: time-based blind
    Title: MySQL >= 5.0.12 AND time-based blind (query SLEEP)
    Payload: fromdate=111111-11-11' AND (SELECT 2563 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))hKla) AND 'xvhk'='xvhk&todate=222222-02-22&submit=
