## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-11960:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `formSetPortTr` function within the D-Link DIR-605L router's firmware.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** The `curTime` parameter from a POST request is passed to the `sprintf` function, which is used to copy the value into a buffer (`v15`). Because the size of the `curTime` parameter is controllable by the attacker, the `sprintf` operation can write beyond the bounds of the buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** By overflowing the buffer, an attacker could potentially overwrite adjacent memory locations, leading to arbitrary code execution on the affected device. This could allow an attacker to gain control of the router and potentially the network it manages.
- **Denial of Service:** A buffer overflow can also lead to a denial-of-service condition by causing the device to crash or become unresponsive.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over the network.
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector involves sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/formSetPortTr` endpoint, containing a `curTime` parameter with an oversized value.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the device.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable endpoint: `/goform/formSetPortTr`.
- **Ability to Send HTTP Requests:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
- **No Authentication Required:** The provided proof of concept (POC) does not indicate the requirement for any prior authentication.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `formSetPortTr` function of the firmware.
- The `curTime` parameter is used within a `sprintf` call that copies it to a local buffer `v15`.
-  The vulnerability is triggered when a large value for `curTime` is provided such that the `sprintf` call overflows its buffer.
- The affected firmware version is D-Link DIR-605L 2.13B01 BETA.
- The vulnerability is described in a GitHub document: [https://github.com/offshore0315/loT-vulnerable/blob/main/D-Link/formSetPortTr.md](https://github.com/offshore0315/loT-vulnerable/blob/main/D-Link/formSetPortTr.md)
