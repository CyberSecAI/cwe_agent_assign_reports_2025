  "description": "A vulnerability was found in D-Link DIR-605L 2.13B01. It has been declared as critical. This vulnerability affects the function formSetPortTr of the file /goform/formSetPortTr. The manipulation of the argument curTime leads to **buffer overflow**. The attack can be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-11960:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n- A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `formSetPortTr` function within the D-Link DIR-605L router's firmware.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Buffer Overflow:** The `curTime` parameter from a POST request is passed to the `sprintf` function, which is used to copy the value into a buffer (`v15`). Because the size of the `curTime` parameter is controllable by the attacker, the `sprintf` operation can write beyond the bounds of the buffer.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Remote Code Execution:** By overflowing the buffer, an attacker could potentially overwrite adjacent memory locations, leading to arbitrary code execution on the affected device. This could allow an attacker to gain control of the router and potentially the network it manages.\n- **Denial of Service:** A buffer overflow can also lead to a denial-of-service condition by causing the device to crash or become unresponsive.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over the network.\n- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector involves sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/formSetPortTr` endpoint, containing a `curTime` parameter with an oversized value.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the device.\n- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable endpoint: `/goform/formSetPortTr`.\n- **Ability to Send HTTP Requests:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint.\n- **No Authentication Required:** The provided proof of concept (POC) does not indicate the requirement for any prior authentication.\n\n**Technical Details:**\n- The vulnerability lies in the `formSetPortTr` function of the firmware.\n- The `curTime` parameter is used within a `sprintf` call that copies it to a local buffer `v15`.\n-  The vulnerability is triggered when a large value for `curTime` is provided such that the `sprintf` call overflows its buffer.\n- The affected firmware version is D-Link DIR-605L 2.13B01 BETA.\n- The vulnerability is described in a GitHub document: [https://github.com/offshore0315/loT-vulnerable/blob/main/D-Link/formSetPortTr.md](https://github.com/offshore0315/loT-vulnerable/blob/main/D-Link/formSetPortTr.md)\n\nThis information provides significantly more details than the placeholder description of the CVE.",

CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow) is a variant of the more general CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). CWE-120 (Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input) can lead to CWE-121 if the buffer is on the stack. I chose CWE-120 as primary, because the vulnerability description mentions buffer copy without checking size.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe120[\"CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size\"]\n    cwe121[\"CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n\n    cwe121 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe120 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe121\n    cwe121 -->|INSTANCEOF| cwe120\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe120 primary\n    class cwe121,cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper handling of input `curTime`**, leading to a **buffer overflow** due to the `sprintf` function copying the value without checking its size. This allows an attacker to potentially overwrite adjacent memory locations, leading to arbitrary code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on the **buffer overflow** vulnerability, which is explicitly mentioned in the description. The evidence from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary is strong, clearly stating that the `curTime` parameter is passed to the `sprintf` function without proper size validation, leading to a buffer overflow.\n\nThe selection of CWE-120 is based on the fact that the vulnerability involves copying a buffer without checking the size of the input. The vulnerability is triggered when a large value for `curTime` is provided such that the `sprintf` call overflows its buffer.\n\nCWE-121 is included as a secondary CWE because the overflow occurs on the stack, as suggested by the function name and the nature of local variables within a function.\n\nCWE-119 is a broader category, and while applicable, it is less specific than CWE-120 and CWE-121.\n\nThe retriever results also support the selection of CWE-120, CWE-121 and CWE-119.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-134: Use of Externally-Controlled Format String\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a function that accepts a format string as an argument, but the format string originates from an external source.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n*Not Used*: While `sprintf` is related to format strings, the core issue isn't the format string itself being externally controlled, but rather the lack of size checking when copying data into a buffer.\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
