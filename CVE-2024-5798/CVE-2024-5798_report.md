# Analysis Report for CVE-2024-5798

# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-5798

## Description

Vault and Vault Enterprise **did not properly validate the JSON Web Token (JWT) role-bound audience claim** when using the Vault JWT auth method. This may have resulted in Vault validating a JWT the audience and role-bound claims do not match, allowing an invalid login to succeed when it should have been rejected. This vulnerability, CVE-2024-5798, was fixed in Vault and Vault Enterprise 1.17.0, 1.16.3, and 1.15.9

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Rootcause:** did not properly validate the JSON Web Token (JWT) role-bound audience claim
- **Impact:** allowing an invalid login to succeed when it should have been rejected
- **Product:** Vault and Vault Enterprise
- **Version:** before 1.17.0, 1.16.3, and 1.15.9
- **Component:** Vault JWT auth method

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary

| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-347 | Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature | 0.9 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-287 | Improper Authentication | 0.7 | Class | Secondary | Discouraged |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship influencing the decision is that CWE-347 [Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature] is a specific type of authentication failure. While CWE-287 [Improper Authentication] is a broader category, CWE-347 directly addresses the cryptographic aspect of the **incorrect validation** of the JWT signature. CWE-347 is a more specific case and therefore more appropriate than its parent, CWE-287.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain begins with the **improper validation** of the JWT audience claim (CWE-347). This leads to a bypass of authentication, resulting in an invalid login succeeding.

CWE-347 (Root Cause) -> Invalid Login (Impact)

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The vulnerability description clearly states that the issue stems from Vault **not properly validating the JSON Web Token (JWT) role-bound audience claim**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary further elaborates that the **incorrect JWT audience validation** is the primary weakness.

The Retriever Results listed several candidate CWEs, including CWE-502 [Deserialization of Untrusted Data], CWE-267 [Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions], CWE-863 [Incorrect Authorization], and CWE-287 [Improper Authentication]. However, after careful consideration, CWE-347 [Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature] was chosen as the primary CWE because it directly addresses the **incorrect verification** of the cryptographic signature within the JWT. This is also directly supported by the fact that Vault only applied validation logic if the audience claim was a single string, failing to handle cases where it was a list of strings

CWE-287 [Improper Authentication] was considered as a secondary CWE because the **improper validation** ultimately leads to a bypass of authentication. However, it's a broader category, and CWE-347 is more specific to the cryptographic aspect of the vulnerability. The mapping guidance for CWE-287 discourages its use when lower-level CWEs are applicable.

The selection of CWE-347 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the root cause: the **improper validation** of the JWT signature. This is a base-level CWE, which is preferred for mapping to root causes.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not verify, or incorrectly verifies, the cryptographic signature for data.
