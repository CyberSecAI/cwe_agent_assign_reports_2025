  "description": "Vault and Vault Enterprise **did not properly validate the JSON Web Token (JWT) role-bound audience claim** when using the Vault JWT auth method. This may have resulted in Vault validating a JWT the audience and role-bound claims do not match, allowing an invalid login to succeed when it should have been rejected. This vulnerability, CVE-2024-5798, was fixed in Vault and Vault Enterprise 1.17.0, 1.16.3, and 1.15.9",

  },
  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n\n*   The vulnerability stems from an incorrect implementation of JWT audience claim validation within the Vault JWT auth method. Specifically, Vault only applied validation logic if the audience claim was a single string, failing to handle cases where it was a list of strings, which is allowed by RFC 7518.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n\n*   **Incorrect JWT Audience Validation:** The primary weakness is the flawed validation logic for the JWT audience claim. When the audience claim was provided as a list of strings, the validation logic was skipped, leading to a bypass of security checks.\n*   **Missing Role-Bound Audience Check:** The intended logic to verify the presence of role-bound audience claims against the JWT audience claims was not executed when the audience was a list, resulting in improper authentication.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker could potentially bypass authentication by presenting a JWT with an audience claim structured as a list of strings, even if it did not match the expected role-bound audiences.\n*   **Invalid Login Success:** Vault would incorrectly validate the JWT, allowing an invalid login to succeed, which would not have happened if the audience validation had been performed correctly.\n*   **Compromised System Access:** Successful login through this vulnerability could grant an attacker access to the underlying system protected by Vault.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Malicious JWT:** An attacker crafts a JWT with an audience claim structured as a list of strings, ensuring it bypasses Vault's faulty validation.\n*   **JWT Auth Method:** The vulnerability is specific to the JWT auth method of Vault.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Ability to forge JWTs:** The attacker needs to be able to create or manipulate JWTs, potentially by controlling the system that issues the tokens.\n*   **Knowledge of the vulnerable Vault setup:** The attacker must be aware that the target system uses the Vault JWT auth method and the version is vulnerable.\n*  **Access to Vault endpoint:** The attacker needs to be able to send their forged JWT to the Vault server.",

While CWE-287 [Improper Authentication] is a broader category, CWE-347 directly addresses the cryptographic aspect of the **incorrect validation** of the JWT signature. CWE-347 is a more specific case and therefore more appropriate than its parent, CWE-287.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe347[\"CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n\n    cwe347 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe347 primary\n    class cwe287 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the **improper validation** of the JWT audience claim (CWE-347). This leads to a bypass of authentication, resulting in an invalid login succeeding.\n\nCWE-347 (Root Cause) -> Invalid Login (Impact)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The vulnerability description clearly states that the issue stems from Vault **not properly validating the JSON Web Token (JWT) role-bound audience claim**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary further elaborates that the **incorrect JWT audience validation** is the primary weakness.\n\nThe Retriever Results listed several candidate CWEs, including CWE-502 [Deserialization of Untrusted Data], CWE-267 [Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions], CWE-863 [Incorrect Authorization], and CWE-287 [Improper Authentication]. However, after careful consideration, CWE-347 [Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature] was chosen as the primary CWE because it directly addresses the **incorrect verification** of the cryptographic signature within the JWT. This is also directly supported by the fact that Vault only applied validation logic if the audience claim was a single string, failing to handle cases where it was a list of strings\n\nCWE-287 [Improper Authentication] was considered as a secondary CWE because the **improper validation** ultimately leads to a bypass of authentication. However, it's a broader category, and CWE-347 is more specific to the cryptographic aspect of the vulnerability. The mapping guidance for CWE-287 discourages its use when lower-level CWEs are applicable.\n\nThe selection of CWE-347 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the root cause: the **improper validation** of the JWT signature. This is a base-level CWE, which is preferred for mapping to root causes.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not verify, or incorrectly verifies, the cryptographic signature for data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1286: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input that is expected to be well-formed - i.e., to comply with a certain syntax - but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input complies with the syntax.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
