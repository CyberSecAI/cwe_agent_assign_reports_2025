This lack of proper sanitization allows for the injection of malicious code within the title field.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\\n\\n*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. Malicious JavaScript code injected into a calendar event title is stored in the database and executed when the event is displayed, particularly during the event deletion prompt.\\n\\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\\n\\n*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** A successful exploit could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser.\\n*   **Potential Account Takeover:**  Depending on the context, this could lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, and potentially, complete account compromise of other users interacting with the calendar.\\n*   **Data Theft/Manipulation:** An attacker might use the XSS to steal sensitive information or modify the content of the page, leading to phishing or other malicious activity.\\n\\n**Attack Vectors:**\\n\\n*   **Calendar Event Title Injection:** The attacker injects malicious code within the title of a calendar event.\\n*   **User Interaction with Delete Prompt:** The malicious code executes when the user interacts with the delete confirmation prompt of an event, where the event title is displayed.\\n\\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\\n\\n*   **Moodle User Access:** The attacker must be a user with the capability to create calendar events and edit their titles.\\n*   **Target User Interaction:** A separate user must trigger the vulnerability by attempting to delete the maliciously crafted calendar event.\\n\\n**Additional Information:**\\n\\n*   **Affected Versions:** Moodle versions 4.4, 4.3 to 4.3.4, 4.2 to 4.2.7, 4.1 to 4.1.10, and earlier unsupported versions are affected.\\n*   **Fixed Versions:** The vulnerability is fixed in Moodle versions 4.4.1, 4.3.5, 4.2.8, and 4.1.11.\\n*   **Severity:** The vulnerability is categorized as a **Minor** severity risk.\\n*   **Moodle Tracker Issue:** MDL-81412 is the corresponding tracker issue.\\n\\nThe provided content gives more technical details than the CVE description, elaborating on the specific context of the vulnerability within the calendar's delete prompt.\", similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {}, 'top_cwes_by_threshold': {}}}, similarity_summary=SimilarityInsight(consensus_cwe='', top_cwes=[], confidence_levels={}, total_samples=0), analysis='', analysis_with_relationships='', criticism='', resolution='', relevant_cwes=[{'metadata': {'doc_id': '116', 'name': 'Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.

CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output (Score: 236.77)\n\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved....\n\n### 2. CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) (Score: 192.61)\n\nThe web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request....\n\n### 3. CWE-93: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection') (Score: 167.14)\n\nThe product uses CRLF (carriage return line feeds) as a special element, e.g. to separate lines or records, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CRLF sequences from inputs....\n\n### 4. CWE-778: Insufficient Logging (Score: 164.25)\n\nWhen a security-critical event occurs, the product either does not record the event or omits important details about the event when logging it....\n\n### 5. CWE-156: Improper Neutralization of Whitespace (Score: 153.22)\n\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as whitespace when they are sent to a downstream component....\n\n## WEAKNESS: 'XSS'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this WEAKNESS:\n\n### 1.
