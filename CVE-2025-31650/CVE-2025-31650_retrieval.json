A large number of such requests could trigger an OutOfMemoryException resulting in a denial of service. This issue affects Apache Tomcat from 9.0.76 through 9.0.102, from 10.1.10 through 10.1.39, from 11.0.0-M2 through 11.0.5. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 9.0.104, 10.1.40 or 11.0.6 which fix the issue.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'Input Validation vulnerability'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1.
