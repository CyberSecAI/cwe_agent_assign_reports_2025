  "description": "Improper **Input Validation vulnerability** in Apache Tomcat. **Incorrect error handling** for some invalid HTTP priority headers resulted in incomplete clean-up of the failed request which created a **memory leak**. A large number of such requests could trigger an OutOfMemoryException resulting in a denial of service. This issue affects Apache Tomcat from 9.0.76 through 9.0.102, from 10.1.10 through 10.1.39, from 11.0.0-M2 through 11.0.5. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 9.0.104, 10.1.40 or 11.0.6 which fix the issue.",

Here's a breakdown of the information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nIncorrect error handling for invalid HTTP priority headers in HTTP/2 requests. This resulted in incomplete cleanup of failed requests, leading to a memory leak.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Improper Input Validation\n*   Memory Leak\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nA large number of requests with invalid HTTP priority headers could trigger an OutOfMemoryException, resulting in a denial of service (DoS).\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\nSending a large number of malformed HTTP/2 requests with invalid priority headers.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\nAn attacker needs to be able to send HTTP/2 requests to the affected Tomcat server. No specific privileges are required.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\nUpgrade to Apache Tomcat 9.0.104, 10.1.40, or 11.0.6.\n\n**Affected versions:**\n\n*   Apache Tomcat 9.0.76 through 9.0.102\n*   Apache Tomcat 10.1.10 through 10.1.39\n*   Apache Tomcat 11.0.0-M2 through 11.0.5\n\nThe content provides more detail than the placeholder CVE description.\n\nThe other provided content is unrelated to the CVE.",
