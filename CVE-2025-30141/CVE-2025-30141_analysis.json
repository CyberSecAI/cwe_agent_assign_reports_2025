  "description": "An issue was discovered on G-Net Dashcam BB GONX devices. One can Remotely Dump Video Footage and the Live Video Stream. It exposes API endpoints on ports 9091 and 9092 that allow remote access to recorded and live video feeds. An attacker who connects to the dashcams network can retrieve all stored recordings and convert them from JDR format to MP4. Additionally, port 9092s RTSP stream can be accessed remotely, allowing real-time video feeds to be extracted without the owners knowledge.",

CWE-319 is added as sensitive data is transmitted without encryption.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe306 primary\n    class cwe319 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **missing authentication** for critical functions (CWE-306). This allows an attacker to access video footage and live video streams, leading to the exposure of sensitive information. The transmission of this data in cleartext (CWE-319) exacerbates the issue, making it easier for attackers to intercept the data.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on the retriever results and the vulnerability description. The primary weakness is the **missing authentication** for critical functions, which directly leads to unauthorized access to sensitive data. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section clearly states the **root cause of the vulnerability** as the ability to remotely dump video footage and live video streams. The dashcam allows listing video recordings and dumping live feed without proper authentication.\nCWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) is the most appropriate primary CWE as it accurately describes the **root cause**. I considered CWE-287 (Improper Authentication), but it is too general, and CWE-306 is a more specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability.\nCWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information) is a valid secondary CWE because the vulnerability description indicates that the video streams are accessed remotely, implying they are transmitted in cleartext and without encryption, compounding the risk of exposure.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of
