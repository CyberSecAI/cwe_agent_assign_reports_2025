It details a SQL injection vulnerability in \"Restaurant Management System Project V1.0\".  It provides more detail than a typical CVE description.\n\nHere's the extracted information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\n*   Insufficient user input validation of the 'id' parameter in `/admin/reservation_view.php?id=45`. The application directly uses the 'id' parameter in SQL queries without proper cleaning or validation.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   SQL Injection\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   Unauthorized database access\n*   Sensitive data leakage\n*   Data tampering\n*   Comprehensive system control\n*   Service interruption\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   HTTP GET request to `/admin/reservation_view.php?id=45` with a malicious 'id' parameter.\n*   No login or authorization is required.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   Unauthenticated attacker with network access to the application.\n*   Ability to craft malicious SQL queries.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n1.  **Use prepared statements and parameter binding:**  Separate SQL code from user input data.\n2.  **Input validation and filtering:**  Strictly validate and filter user input.\n3.  **Minimize database user permissions:** Use accounts with the minimum necessary permissions.\n4.  **Regular security audits:** Conduct regular code and system security audits.\n\n**Payload Examples (from sqlmap):**\n\nThe content includes several SQLmap payloads for different types of SQL injection attacks:\n\n*   Boolean-based blind\n*   Error-based\n*   Time-based blind\n*   UNION query\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n*   **Affected Product:** Restaurant Management System Project in PHP with Source Code\n*   **Vendor Homepage:** <https://itsourcecode.com/free-projects/php-project/online-restaurant-management-system-project-in-php-with-source-code/>\n*   **Vulnerable File:** `/admin/reservation_view.php?id=45`\n*   **Version:** V1.0\n*   **Software Link:** <https://itsourcecode.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/altonsystem.zip>\n*   **Submitter:** pyj2cve",

The analysis focuses on the direct identification of SQL Injection as the core issue. No other CWEs are necessary to fully describe the vulnerability based on the evidence.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe89 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain consists of a single point:\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** CWE-89 - Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') due to insufficient input validation of the 'id' parameter.\n   - This leads directly to unauthorized database access and potential data tampering.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary vulnerability is clearly SQL Injection (CWE-89). The vulnerability description explicitly states this, and the CVE reference content summary confirms it. The root cause is the **insufficient user input validation** of the 'id' parameter in `/admin/reservation_view.php`.
