Argo CD has a Web-based terminal that allows users to get a shell inside a running pod, just as they would with kubectl exec.

Although the token expiration and revocation of the user are fixed, however, the fix does not address the situation of revocation of only user `p, rolemyrole, exec, create, */*, allow` permissions, which may still lead to the leakage of sensitive information.
