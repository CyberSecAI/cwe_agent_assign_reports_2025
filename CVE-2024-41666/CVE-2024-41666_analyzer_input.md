# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-41666

## Vulnerability Description
Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. Argo CD has a Web-based terminal that allows users to get a shell inside a running pod, just as they would with kubectl exec. Starting in version 2.6.0, when the administrator enables this function and grants permission to the user `p, rolemyrole, exec, create, */*, allow`, even if the user revokes this permission, the user can still perform operations in the container, as long as the user keeps the terminal view open for a long time. Although the token expiration and revocation of the user are fixed, however, the fix does not address the situation of revocation of only user `p, rolemyrole, exec, create, */*, allow` permissions, which may still lead to the leakage of sensitive information. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in Argo CD versions 2.11.7, 2.10.16, and 2.9.21.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** perform operations in the container
- **vector:** Web-based terminal
- **attacker:** user with revoked permissions
- **product:** Argo CD
- **version:** 2.6.0 to 2.10.16

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-41666:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the Argo CD web terminal session not properly handling the revocation of user permissions. Specifically, after a user's `exec` permissions are revoked, the established WebSocket connection to the terminal remains active, allowing the user to continue executing commands inside the container.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Insufficient permission checks:**  The application only verifies RBAC permissions during the initial handshake of the WebSocket connection. It fails to validate permissions on subsequent messages sent through the same connection.
- **Lack of real-time permission enforcement:**  Permissions are not re-evaluated during the lifespan of the terminal session, which means revocation of permissions is not effective immediately.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized access:** A user whose `exec` permissions have been revoked can still access and execute commands inside the target container.
- **Sensitive information disclosure:** The attacker can use the terminal to access and potentially leak sensitive information from the container.
- **Compromise of the container:** Continued access could lead to further unauthorized activities, such as modifying data or disrupting services.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-based terminal:** The attack leverages the Argo CD's web-based terminal feature.
- **WebSocket connection:** The vulnerability is exposed through the established WebSocket connection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
1. **Initial permissions:** The attacker must initially be granted `exec` permissions to the target application in Argo CD.
2. **Open terminal session:** The attacker needs to open and maintain an active terminal session before the administrator revokes the `exec` permission.
3. **Argo CD access:** Requires access to the Argo CD UI.

**Technical Details:**

The fix involves verifying RBAC permissions not just during the handshake but on each message sent over the websocket. This is achieved by adding a `validatePermissions` function that checks the permissions before every `Read` operation on the websocket, and sends a permission denied message if the user lacks the necessary permissions, closing the connection.

The code changes are in the files `server/application/terminal.go`, `server/application/websocket.go`, and `server/application/websocket_test.go`. The key changes include:

- Passing the RBAC enforcer and application name to the `newTerminalSession` function.
- Implementing `validatePermissions` in `terminalSession` to enforce permissions on each read.
-  Modifying `Read` function in `terminalSession` to call `validatePermissions` before reading messages from websocket.
- Adding tests to verify RBAC enforcement.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided information includes a proof-of-concept (PoC) video demonstrating the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is rated as "Moderate" severity.
- Patches are available in Argo CD versions 2.11.7, 2.10.16, and 2.9.21.
- The vulnerability is similar to CVE-2023-40025, but it addresses the scenario where only the `exec` permissions are revoked.

This information is more detailed than a basic CVE description and provides a clear picture of the vulnerability and its fix.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* 🔍 *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* 🔍 *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion – CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### 🔸 CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ✅ *“A user created with the ‘guest’ role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ✅ *“The backup service runs as root but only needs read access.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ⚠️ This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### 🔸 CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ✅ *“User can access another user’s invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.”*

## Mapping Examples – Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *“User can escalate privileges to admin.”*
> ❌ Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged – only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ✅ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**
