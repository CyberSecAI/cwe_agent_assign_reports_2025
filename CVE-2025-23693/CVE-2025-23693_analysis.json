CWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')] is a secondary weakness because the CSRF leads to Stored XSS. These are related but distinct. CWE-352 allows an attacker to induce a user into performing actions they did not intend, which in this case leads to stored XSS.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n\n    cwe352 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe79\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe352 primary\n    class cwe79 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of CSRF protection** (CWE-352), which allows an attacker to trick a user into performing unwanted actions. This leads to Stored XSS (CWE-79) due to **improper neutralization of input**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment, based on the provided evidence, points to CWE-352 [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)] as the primary weakness, with CWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')] as a secondary weakness.\n\nThe vulnerability description explicitly states that the **rootcause is the lack of CSRF protection**, leading to Stored XSS. The evidence from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary supports this, highlighting the Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the WordPress Secure CAPTCHA Plugin.\n\nThe graph relationships confirm this understanding: CWE-352 [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)] can precede CWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')], as a successful CSRF attack can lead to the injection of malicious scripts if input is not properly neutralized.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity.
