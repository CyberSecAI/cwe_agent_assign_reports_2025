  "description": "The Accept Stripe Payments Using Contact Form 7 plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to **Information Exposure** in all versions up to, and including, 2.5 via the cf7sa-info.php file that returns phpinfo() data. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to extract configuration information that can be leveraged in another attack.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Vulnerability:** Unauthenticated Information Exposure\n\n**Root Cause:** The plugin \"Accept Stripe Payments Using Contact Form 7\" versions 2.5 and earlier include a file (`cf7sa-info.php`) that exposes the output of `phpinfo()`.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n*   **Information Exposure:** The `phpinfo()` function reveals sensitive configuration details about the server environment, PHP setup, installed extensions, and other potentially confidential information. This information is available without any authentication.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n*   An attacker can gain valuable insights into the server's configuration, which could aid in planning further attacks. This includes:\n    *   Software versions (OS, PHP, database, etc.).\n    *   Installed PHP modules and their versions.\n    *   Server paths and settings.\n    *   Potentially sensitive environment variables.\n* This could lead to other vulnerabilities being exploited if known weaknesses are present in the software versions identified.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n*   **Network:** An unauthenticated attacker can make a direct request to the vulnerable `cf7sa-info.php` endpoint.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n*   The attacker only needs to know or discover the vulnerable URL endpoint (e.g., `example.com/?cf7sa_info=1`). No prior authentication or access is needed.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.6 of the plugin.\n*   The provided changeset shows that the vulnerable file (`cf7sa-info.php`) was removed in version 2.6.\n*   The changelog in the `readme.txt` mentions \"security issues fixed\" in version 2.6 which is likely referring to this vulnerability\n*   The Wordfence description states that the vulnerable file returns `phpinfo()` data.\n\nThis information goes beyond the placeholder CVE description by providing specifics about the vulnerability, the affected file, the consequences of exploitation, and the fix implemented.",

This leads directly to **information exposure**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified the **information exposure** as the primary weakness, aligning with the vulnerability description. However, the retriever results also highlighted **missing authorization** as a potential contributing factor. After further analysis, it was determined that the **missing authorization** is a prerequisite for the **information exposure**, as the `cf7sa-info.php` file should not be accessible without authentication. The final decision was to primarily focus on CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor and CWE-862 Missing Authorization. While CWE-200 is discouraged, it is the best fit for describing the vulnerability. The selected CWEs are at the Class level, balancing specificity and broad applicability. The evidence directly supports these classifications, as the vulnerability description explicitly mentions the exposure of sensitive configuration information to unauthenticated attackers.\n\nRelevant
