Other macros like Viewppt are vulnerable to the same kind of attack. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.10.1.",

  },
  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n\n*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `Viewpdf` macro and similar macros (`Viewppt`, `Viewdoc`, `Viewxls`, and `Viewfile`). The macro's `name` parameter (or `att--filename`) is inserted into a context where XWiki syntax is executed without prior escaping, leading to potential code injection. Specifically, the `Viewpdf.xml` file shows that the `filename` parameter was not properly escaped before being used in a `pdfviewer` macro (and similarly for other macros).\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n\n*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  The primary vulnerability is RCE. By injecting malicious XWiki syntax, attackers can execute arbitrary Groovy code on the server. This is made possible by the vulnerable macros, which directly use the provided parameter without sanitizing it.\n*   **Missing Input Sanitization:** The core issue is the lack of escaping/sanitization of user-provided input (`name` parameter in the macros). This allows the injection of malicious code.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Full System Compromise:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to access and modify all data stored in the XWiki instance.\n*   **Server Access:** It's possible that an attacker could leverage RCE to gain access to the server on which XWiki is running.\n*   **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:** This vulnerability affects all three aspects of security, as the attacker could read, modify, and destroy the data, causing a complete compromise of the system.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Macro Parameter Injection:** The primary attack vector is through the `name` parameter (or `att--filename` parameter) of the vulnerable macros. This parameter can be manipulated to inject malicious code.\n*   **CKEditor.HTMLConverter:** Attackers can also exploit this vulnerability using the `CKEditor.HTMLConverter`, accessible with view rights, to inject the malicious macro call via a crafted javascript snippet.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users (guests) who have view rights to any page. This is due to the fact that the CKEditor.HTMLConverter can be accessed with view rights.\n*   **Knowledge of XWiki Syntax:** The attacker needs to understand how XWiki syntax works to construct a successful injection.\n*   **Ability to Submit Crafted Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to submit HTTP requests with the malicious parameter through the vulnerable macro.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n*   The vulnerability affects versions `1.0` and above of the `xwiki-pro-macros` package.\n*   The vulnerability was patched in version `1.10.1` by properly escaping the macro parameters.\n*   The provided commit diffs show that the fix involves using `$services.rendering.escape()` on the `name`/`filename` parameters before using them in the macro.\n*   The vulnerability is rated as **Critical** with a CVSS score of 10.0.\n*  The provided content contains a PoC (Proof of Concept) that demonstrates how to exploit the vulnerability.\n* The CVE ID associated with this vulnerability is **CVE-2024-42489**\n\nIn summary, this is a critical vulnerability due to its ease of exploitation, lack of required authentication, and the severe impact of full system compromise. The vulnerability was fixed by ensuring proper escaping of user-provided parameters before execution.",

The secondary CWE is CWE-79, which is related to cross-site scripting. CWE-1336 is a more specific case of improper neutralization, which makes it a better fit as the primary CWE. CWE-79 represents the broader category of XSS vulnerabilities, which can arise from various input handling issues.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1336[\"CWE-1336: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe138[\"CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\"]\n    \n    cwe1336 -->|CHILDOF| cwe138\n    cwe79 -->|PEEROF| cwe1336\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1336 primary\n    class cwe79 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing escaping in the Viewpdf macro** (and similar macros). This leads to the ability to inject malicious code via the `name` or `att--filename` parameters. The injected code is then executed due to the improper handling of special elements within the template engine (CWE-1336), resulting in remote code execution. The impact is full system compromise.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and CVE reference links. The **root cause** is the **missing escaping** of user-provided input in the `Viewpdf` macro, which allows attackers to inject malicious code. This code is then interpreted by the template engine, leading to remote code execution.\n\nThe primary CWE is CWE-1336, as it specifically addresses the improper neutralization of special elements used in a template engine. The evidence for this is the description stating the vulnerability lies in the `Viewpdf` macro, where input isn't properly escaped before being used in a context where XWiki syntax is executed. The CVE reference links further confirm this by indicating the fix involves using `$services.rendering.escape()` on the `name`/`filename` parameters.\n\nCWE-79 is considered a secondary CWE, as it represents the broader category of XSS vulnerabilities. While the vulnerability could lead to XSS, the more specific weakness lies in the improper handling of special elements within the template engine itself.\n\nThe choice of CWE-1336 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly reflects the **root cause** of the vulnerability \u2013 the **improper neutralization** of special elements within the template engine.\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
