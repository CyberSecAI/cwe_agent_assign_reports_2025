The vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"**path traversal**,\" which aligns with the core concept of CWE-22. |\n| CWE-73 | External Control of File Name or Path | 0.5 | Base | Allowed | Secondary candidate. While CWE-22 is more specific, CWE-73 could be considered as a broader categorization since the file path is influenced by external input.|\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship that influenced the decision was the hierarchical relationship between CWE-22 and its parent CWEs. CWE-22 is a Base level CWE, which is generally preferred. The retriever results also support CWE-22 as the top candidate.
