## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
**Relevant Information:**

*   **Vulnerability:** SQL injection
*   **Affected File:** /admin/member\_save.php
*   **Affected Software:** Restaurant Management System System V1.0
*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to insufficient user input validation of the 'last' parameter, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL queries. Attackers can inject malicious code from the parameter 'last' and use it directly in SQL queries without the need for appropriate cleaning or validation.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can gain unauthorized database access, sensitive data leakage, data tampering, comprehensive system control, and even service interruption.
*   **Attack Vector:** Exploitation involves injecting malicious SQL queries into the 'last' parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** No login or authorization is required to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Payload examples:**
    *   `last=1' AND 7669=7669 AND 'kOhf'='kOhf&first=1&contact=1&address=1`
    *   `last=1' AND (SELECT 1625 FROM(SELECT COUNT(*),CONCAT(0x7176627071,(SELECT (ELT(1625=1625,1))),0x71716b7871,FLOOR(RAND(0)*2))x FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PLUGINS GROUP BY x)a) AND 'lKIU'='lKIU&first=1&contact=1&address=1`
    *   `last=1' AND (SELECT 1625 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))dyWD) AND 'MxCN'='MxCN&first=1&contact=1&address=1`
*   **Mitigation/Fix:**
    1.  Use prepared statements and parameter binding.
    2.  Input validation and filtering.
    3.  Minimize database user permissions.
    4.  Regular security audits.
