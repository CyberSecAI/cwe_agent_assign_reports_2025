Repeated requests to the `/accessdenied` URL can cause a denial of access to the PCSS Web UI.\n- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper authentication (CWE-287)\n- **Impact of exploitation:** Denial of service, specifically preventing access to the web interface of the PowerChute Serial Shutdown (PCSS) application. The PCSS application itself remains functional and continues to protect the server.\n- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending repeated requests to the `/accessdenied` URL from the local network.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be on the local network and able to send requests to the affected system. The attacker does not need any prior authentication.",

However, based on the evidence, CWE-287 remains the most suitable high-level classification. The relationship between authentication and authorization was also considered, ensuring that the focus remained on the authentication aspect of the vulnerability. CWE-799 was considered as a secondary CWE to account for the impact of repeated requests.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe799[\"CWE-799: Improper Control of Interaction Frequency\"]\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe287 primary\n    class cwe799 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **Improper Authentication** (CWE-287). The impact is a denial of access to the web interface. The attacker repeatedly requests the /accessdenied URL.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-287 **Improper Authentication** as the primary weakness. The vulnerability description clearly states that the **rootcause** is an **Improper Authentication vulnerability**, and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this. The vulnerability leads to a denial of access to the web interface when an attacker on the local network repeatedly requests the `/accessdenied` URL. This aligns with the characteristics of **Improper Authentication**, where the system fails to properly validate the user's identity, leading to unauthorized access or, in this case, a denial of service due to resource exhaustion.\n\nThe Retriever Results listed several candidate CWEs, including CWE-294 (Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay), CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function), CWE-290 (Authentication Bypass by Spoofing), and others. However, these were deemed less appropriate because the provided information does not indicate a complete bypass of authentication or a missing authentication check for a critical function. Instead, the vulnerability stems from an **improperly implemented authentication** mechanism that is susceptible to denial-of-service attacks via repeated requests.\n\nCWE-799 **Improper Control of Interaction Frequency** was considered as a secondary weakness because the vulnerability is triggered by repeated requests to the `/accessdenied` URL. This suggests that the system does not adequately control the frequency of interactions, allowing an attacker to overwhelm the authentication mechanism and cause a denial of service.\n\nThe selection of CWE-287 is based on the explicit mention of \"**Improper Authentication vulnerability**\" in the description, as well as the root cause analysis in the CVE reference. The mapping guidance confirms that CWE-287 is appropriate for authentication errors. The selection of CWE-799 as a secondary weakness is based on the observation that the vulnerability is triggered by repeated requests, indicating a lack of control over interaction frequency.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product requires authentication, but the product has an alternate path or channel that does not require authentication.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-305: Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe authentication algorithm is sound, but the implemented mechanism can be bypassed as the result of a separate weakness that is primary to the authentication error.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
