The specific impact depends on the functionality exposed by the plugin and how it is used within the application.\\n\\n**Attack vectors:**\\nThe attack vector is CSRF, meaning the attacker would typically use social engineering to trick a logged-in user into submitting a malicious request. This could be done by embedding a crafted request into a link, an image, or via a malicious website.\\n\\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\\nThe attacker does not need prior authentication on the target WordPress site. The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious request and trick a logged-in user to trigger it. The attacker would also need some knowledge of the plugin\\'s functionality.\\n\\n**Additional information:**\\n- The vulnerability is classified under OWASP Top 10 \"A1: Broken Access Control\".\\n- The vulnerability is rated as low priority with a CVSS score of 7.1.\\n-  No official fix is currently available.', similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {}, 'top_cwes_by_threshold': {}}}, similarity_summary=SimilarityInsight(consensus_cwe='', top_cwes=[], confidence_levels={}, total_samples=0), analysis='', analysis_with_relationships='', criticism='', resolution='', relevant_cwes=[{'metadata': {'doc_id': '918', 'name': 'Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The web server receives a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'weakness:Cross-Site Request Forgery', 'keyphrase': 'Cross-Site Request Forgery', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'version:through 1.1', 'keyphrase': 'through 1.1', 'type': 'version'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(217.91971319054986)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '601', 'name': \"URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')\", 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The web application accepts a user-controlled input that specifies a link to an external site, and uses that link in a redirect.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'weakness:Cross-Site Request Forgery', 'keyphrase': 'Cross-Site Request Forgery', 'type': 'weakness'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(206.4350997057642)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '352', 'name': 'Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'rootcause:improper access control', 'keyphrase': 'improper access control', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'weakness:Cross-Site Request Forgery', 'keyphrase': 'Cross-Site Request Forgery', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'weakness:XSS', 'keyphrase': 'XSS', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'impact:Stored XSS', 'keyphrase': 'Stored XSS', 'type': 'impact'}, {'id': 'product:MELONIQ.NET AppMaps', 'keyphrase': 'MELONIQ.NET AppMaps', 'type': 'product'}, {'id': 'version:through 1.1', 'keyphrase': 'through 1.1', 'type': 'version'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(180.67492946029864)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '79', 'name': \"Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\", 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'rootcause:improper access control', 'keyphrase': 'improper access control', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'weakness:Cross-Site Request Forgery', 'keyphrase': 'Cross-Site Request Forgery', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'weakness:XSS', 'keyphrase': 'XSS', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'impact:Stored XSS', 'keyphrase': 'Stored XSS', 'type': 'impact'}, {'id': 'product:MELONIQ.NET AppMaps', 'keyphrase': 'MELONIQ.NET AppMaps', 'type': 'product'}, {'id': 'version:through 1.1', 'keyphrase': 'through 1.1', 'type': 'version'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(153.79932163435222)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '116', 'name': 'Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
