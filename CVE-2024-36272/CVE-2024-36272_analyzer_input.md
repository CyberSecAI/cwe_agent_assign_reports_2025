# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-36272

## Vulnerability Description
A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the usbip.cgi set_info() functionality of Wavlink AC3000 M33A8.V5030.210505. A specially crafted HTTP request can lead to **stack-based buffer overflow**. An attacker can make an authenticated HTTP request to trigger this vulnerability.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **stack-based buffer overflow**
- **vector:** specially crafted HTTP request
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** Wavlink AC3000
- **version:** M33A8.V5030.210505
- **component:** usbip.cgi set_info() functionality

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2024-36272 based on provided content:

The provided content **is relevant** to CVE-2024-36272. It's a Talos Vulnerability Report detailing a buffer overflow vulnerability in the Wavlink AC3000 router. It provides more detail than the placeholder CVE description.

Here's an extraction of the relevant information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   Buffer overflow due to insufficient size checks when copying data into stack buffers. Specifically, the `SSID` POST parameter in the `usbip.cgi` script is copied to the stack without a length check via `strdup` and `sprintf`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   CWE-120 - Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input (‘Classic Buffer Overflow’)
*   Stack-based buffer overflow.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Code execution. An attacker can overwrite the return address of the function, potentially gaining control of the device.

**Attack vectors:**

*   HTTP POST request to `usbip.cgi` with a specially crafted `SSID` parameter.
*   Requires authentication (an authenticated HTTP request).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   Attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable device.
*   Attacker needs to have valid credentials to authenticate to the router.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   The report does not explicitly state a fix, but implies that proper bounds checking on input data (specifically the `SSID` parameter) is required to prevent the buffer overflow.
*   The vendor was notified and was working on patches, but the product has been discontinued.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Vulnerable Product:** Wavlink AC3000 M33A8.V5030.210505
*   **CVSSv3 Score:** 9.1 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)
*   **Vulnerable Function:** `set_info()` within `usbip.cgi`
*   **Timeline:** Includes dates of vendor contact, disclosure, and public release.
