# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-47948

## Vulnerability Description
Cocotais Bot is a QQ official robot framework based on qq-bot-sdk. Starting in version 1.5.0-test2-hotfix and prior to version 1.6.2, command echoing feature in the framework allows users to indirectly trigger privileged behavior by injecting special platform tags. Specifically, an unauthorized user can use the `/echo ` command to cause the bot to send a message that mentions all members in the chat, bypassing any permission controls. This can lead to spam, disruption, or abuse of notification systems. Version 1.6.2 contains a patch for the issue.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-47948 based on provided content

The provided content is **RELEVANT** to CVE-2025-47948. It details a command injection vulnerability in the `cocotais-bot` npm package. Here's a breakdown of the information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of sanitization or filtering of platform-specific control elements within the `/echo` command. Specifically, the bot doesn't prevent users from injecting tags like `<qqbot-at-everyone />`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Command Injection:**  The `/echo` command allows indirect triggering of privileged behavior through injected platform tags.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The bot fails to sanitize user input before echoing it, leading to the execution of unintended commands.

**Impact of exploitation:**

An unauthorized user can exploit the vulnerability to send a message that mentions all members in the chat (`@ÂÖ®‰ΩìÊàêÂëò`), bypassing permission controls. This can lead to:

*   Spam
*   Disruption
*   Abuse of notification systems

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
*   A user sends the following message: `/echo <qqbot-at-everyone />`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be a regular user in the chat where the bot is present.
*   No special permissions are required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Mitigation or fix:**

The vulnerability was patched in version 1.6.2. The commit `d1cf01a` removes the `/echo` builtin command. The code diff shows the removal of the relevant section in `src/builtins.ts`.

**CVSS Score:**

*   **CVSS v3 overall score:** 7.2 / 10
*   **CVSS v3 base metrics:**
    *   Attack Vector: Network
    *   Attack Complexity: Low
    *   Privileges Required: None
    *   User Interaction: None
    *   Scope: Changed
    *   Confidentiality: None
    *   Integrity: Low
    *   Availability: Low

**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**

*   The vulnerability affects versions `1.5.0-test2-hotfix` and `<= 1.6.1`.
*   A Proof of Concept (PoC) is provided, detailing the steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability is attributed to the reporter Destroyed-Dream.
*   The CWE associated with the vulnerability is CWE-74 (Injection).

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set ‚Äì Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* üîç *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* üîç *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion ‚Äì CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### üî∏ CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ‚úÖ *‚ÄúA user created with the ‚Äòguest‚Äô role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.‚Äù*

#### üî∏ CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ‚úÖ *‚ÄúThe backup service runs as root but only needs read access.‚Äù*

#### üî∏ CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### üî∏ CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ‚úÖ *‚ÄúUser can access another user‚Äôs invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.‚Äù*

## Mapping Examples ‚Äì Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *‚ÄúUser can escalate privileges to admin.‚Äù*
> ‚ùå Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged ‚Äì only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ‚úÖ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**
