The CSRF vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts that are then stored and executed in the context of other users. CWE-352 is a compound weakness, representing a combination of factors that enable the attack. CWE-79 is a base weakness, representing the lack of proper input sanitization.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    \n    cwe79 <--|CANFOLLOW| cwe352\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe352 primary\n    class cwe79 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with CWE-352 [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)], which allows an attacker to perform actions on behalf of another user. This leads to CWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')], where the attacker injects malicious scripts that are stored and executed, resulting in Stored XSS.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary vulnerability is **Cross-Site Request Forgery** (CSRF), as stated in the vulnerability description and confirmed by the CVE reference summary: \"The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\". The **impact** of this vulnerability is that it allows Stored XSS. This makes CWE-352 the primary CWE.\n\nThe retriever results support this assessment, with CWE-352 having the highest combined score. The relationship analysis confirms that CSRF can lead to XSS, which further strengthens the selection of CWE-79 as a secondary CWE, representing the specific type of impact.\n\nThe selection of CWE-352 and CWE-79 is at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-352 is a compound weakness, while CWE-79 is a base weakness.

Web applications often mistakenly make the assumption that data passed to the client in hidden fields or cookies is not susceptible to tampering. Improper validation of data that are user-controllable can lead to the application processing incorrect, and often malicious, input.\n\n\nFor example, custom cookies commonly store session data or persistent data across sessions. This kind of session data is normally involved in security related decisions on the server side, such as user authentication and access control. Thus, the cookies might contain sensitive data such as user credentials and privileges. This is a dangerous practice, as it can often lead to improper reliance on the value of the client-provided cookie by the server side application.\n",
