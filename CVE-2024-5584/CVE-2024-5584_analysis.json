  "description": "The WordPress Online Booking and Scheduling Plugin - Bookly plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to **Stored Cross-Site Scripting** via the Color Profile parameter in all versions up to, and including, 23.2 due to **insufficient input sanitization and output escaping**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with the staff member role and Subscriber-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n- Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the 'Color Profile' parameter.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages that will execute when a user accesses the affected page. This can lead to:\n    - Session hijacking\n    - Defacement\n    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.\n    - Data theft.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the 'Color Profile' parameter.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- Authenticated attacker with at least subscriber-level access.\n- The attacker needs to have the 'staff member' role to access and modify the color profile settings.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n- The vulnerable code is located within the WordPress plugin \"Bookly\" in versions up to and including 23.2.\n- The specific file referenced is `staff-list.js` but the vulnerability is not in this file rather it is in the backend code handling the color profile setting, where it does not properly sanitize user input before storing/rendering it.\n- The vulnerability was reported by 0xBishop.\n- The vulnerability has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2024-5584.\n- The vulnerability was patched in version 23.3.",

CWE-79 is a Base level CWE, which is a preferred level of abstraction. While it has more specific children, the description aligns well with the general case of improper neutralization.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe79 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is as follows:\n1.  **Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping** of the 'Color Profile' parameter.\n2.  **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** vulnerability.\n3.  Attacker injects arbitrary web scripts into pages.\n4.  When a user accesses the injected page, the script executes.\n\nThe **Primary CWE** is CWE-79, which is the root cause in this chain.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that the Bookly plugin is vulnerable to **Stored Cross-Site Scripting** due to **insufficient input sanitization and output escaping**. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" also highlights **insufficient input sanitization and output escaping** as the root cause, leading to the XSS vulnerability.\n\nCWE-79, \"Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\", directly addresses this scenario. The description of CWE-79 states: \"The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.\" This perfectly aligns with the vulnerability where the 'Color Profile' parameter isn't properly sanitized before being rendered in a web page, allowing for XSS attacks.\n\nThe Retriever Results also lists CWE-79 with a good score, further supporting this choice.\n\nOther CWEs Considered:\n\n*   CWE-116: \"Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\": While this is related, CWE-79 is more specific to XSS, making it a better fit.\n*   CWE-352: \"Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\": This is not relevant as the vulnerability is related to XSS, not CSRF.\n*   CWE-862: \"Missing Authorization\": The vulnerability is not due to missing authorization but due to improper handling of input.\n*   CWE-434: \"Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\": This is not relevant as the vulnerability is not related to file uploads.\n\nThe selection of CWE-79 is at the optimal level of specificity as it directly addresses the root cause of the XSS vulnerability.",
