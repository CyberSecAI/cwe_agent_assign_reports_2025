## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability was found in Open Asset Import Library Assimp 5.4.3 and classified as problematic. This issue affects the function MDLImporterInternReadFile_Quake1 of the file assimp/code/AssetLib/MDL/MDLLoader.cpp. The manipulation leads to **out-of-bounds read**. It is possible to launch the attack on the local host. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The project decided to collect all Fuzzer bugs in a main-issue to address them in the future.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **out-of-bounds read**
- **product:** Open Asset Import Library Assimp
- **version:** 5.4.3

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Here's an analysis of the provided content, focusing on vulnerability information:

**Content from github.com_6c04c072_20250624_200935.html**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:**
    *   Heap-buffer-overflow in `MDLImporter::InternReadFile_Quake1`.
    *   The vulnerability is caused by out-of-bounds reads in the `MDLImporter::InternReadFile_Quake1` function when processing MDL files. Specifically:
        *   `pcFrames->type` is out of bounds @ `code/AssetLib/MDL/MDLLoader.cpp:452`
        *   `pcFrames = szCurrent` is out of bounds @ `code/AssetLib/MDL/MDLLoader.cpp:457-459`
    *   A check for the out-of-bounds condition comes too late.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   Heap-buffer-overflow
*   **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   The provided ASAN (AddressSanitizer) output indicates a heap-buffer-overflow, which could lead to:
        *   Denial of service (application crash).
        *   Potential for arbitrary code execution if an attacker can control the data used to trigger the overflow and overwrite critical memory regions.
*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a malicious MDL file to the `MDLImporter`. The `InternReadFile_Quake1` function is used to parse the MDL file.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted MDL file to the vulnerable application.
*   **Mitigation or fix:**
    *   The issue is reported and closed as "not planned", suggesting that there is no mitigation or fix is planned for this issue.
*   **More detail than the official CVE description:**
    *   Yes, the content provides detailed information about the specific code locations where the vulnerability occurs, the root cause, ASAN output, and steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
