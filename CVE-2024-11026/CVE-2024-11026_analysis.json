  "description": "A vulnerability was found in Intelligent Apps Freenow App 12.10.0 on Android. It has been rated as problematic. Affected by this issue is some unknown functionality of the file ch/qos/logback/core/net/ssl/SSL.java of the component Keystore Handler. The manipulation of the argument DEFAULT_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD with the input changeit leads to **use of hard-coded password**. The attack may be launched remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation is known to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",

CWE-259 represents the specific case of using a hard-coded password, rather than a more general credential. The parent-child relationship influenced the selection, favoring the more specific variant.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe259[\"CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password\"]\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    \n    cwe259 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe259 primary\n    class cwe798 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **use of a hard-coded password** (CWE-259). The impact is potential unauthorized access or compromise of the system, though this is not explicitly stated in the provided information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe analysis is based on the vulnerability description which explicitly states \"**use of hard-coded password**\".\n\nThe relevant excerpt is: \"The manipulation of the argument DEFAULT_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD with the input changeit leads to **use of hard-coded password**.\"\n\nCWE-259 (Use of Hard-coded Password) is selected because it directly reflects the vulnerability described. It is a variant of CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials), making it more specific and appropriate.\n\nOther CWEs Considered:\n\n*   CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials): This is a more general case.
