Affected by this issue is some unknown functionality of the file ch/qos/logback/core/net/ssl/SSL.java of the component Keystore Handler. The manipulation of the argument DEFAULT_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD with the input changeit leads to use of hard-coded password. The attack may be launched remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation is known to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way. Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-1394 CWE-620 CWE-1393 CWE-79 CWE-89 CWE-1391 CWE-259 CWE-321",
