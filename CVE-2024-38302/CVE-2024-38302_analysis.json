While there are more specific child CWEs (Base, Variant) related to encryption, the provided information doesn't provide enough detail to pinpoint the specific type of **missing encryption**. The vulnerability chain involves a **missing encryption** leading to information disclosure.

The adjacent network access is the attack vector.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-311 as the primary weakness due to the explicit mention of \"**missing encryption of sensitive data**\" in both the vulnerability description and the CVE reference summary. The analysis also considered the retriever results, which listed CWE-311, CWE-319, CWE-321, and CWE-327 as potential candidates.\n\nThe evidence supporting CWE-311 is strong, with direct mentions in the description: \"Dell Data Lakehouse, version(s) 1.0.0.0, contain(s) a **Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data** vulnerability\" and in the CVE Reference Links Content Summary: \"root_cause: **Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data**\".\n\nAlthough CWE-311 is a Class-level CWE and the guidance discourages its use when more specific options are available, the provided evidence does not allow for a more precise classification. Without knowing the specifics of *how* the encryption is missing, a more specific CWE cannot be selected with confidence. CWE-319 is included as a secondary candidate, assuming the data is transmitted in cleartext.\n\nCWE-200 is included as a secondary candidate because the impact of the **missing encryption** is information disclosure, and this CWE represents that outcome.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n*   **CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data**\n    *   Technical Explanation: The product does not encrypt sensitive information, making it vulnerable to interception and unauthorized access.\n    *   Security Implications: Sensitive data can be easily accessed and exploited if encryption is missing.\n    *   Relationship: Class-level CWE.\n    *   Mapping Guidance: Discouraged, but selected due to lack of specific encryption details.\n*   **CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor**\n    *   Technical Explanation: The product exposes sensitive information to unauthorized actors.\n    *   Security Implications: Unauthorized access to sensitive information.\n    *   Relationship: Class-level CWE.\n    *   Mapping Guidance: Discouraged.\n*   **CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information**\n    *   Technical Explanation: The product transmits sensitive data in cleartext, allowing for interception.\n    *   Security Implications: Sensitive data can be intercepted during transmission.\n    *   Relationship: Base-level CWE, ChildOf CWE-311\n    *   Mapping Guidance: Allowed.\n\nCWEs considered but not used:\n\n*   CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key: While a hard-coded key would be a vulnerability, there's no evidence to suggest this is the case here.\n*   CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm: Again, there's no evidence to suggest that the encryption algorithm itself is broken, only that encryption is missing.\n*   CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength: Similar to CWE-327, the issue is not the strength of the encryption, but its absence.\n*   CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password: Not applicable, as this vulnerability is about encryption, not passwords.\n*   CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer: Not related to the described vulnerability.\n*   CWE-284: Improper Access Control: While related to information disclosure, the root cause is the **missing encryption**, not access control.\n*   CWE-208: Observable Timing Discrepancy: Not related to the described vulnerability.",
