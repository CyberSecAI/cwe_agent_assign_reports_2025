# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-6310

# Vulnerability Description

    The Advanced AJAX Page Loader plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery to **Arbitrary File Upload** in versions up to, and including, 2.7.7. This is due to missing nonce validation in the admin_init_AAPL function and missing file type validation in the AAPL_options_validate function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected sites server which may make remote code execution possible via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
