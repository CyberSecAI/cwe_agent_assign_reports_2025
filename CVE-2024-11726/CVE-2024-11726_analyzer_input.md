# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-11726

## Vulnerability Description
The Appointment Booking Calendar Plugin and Scheduling Plugin BookingPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the category parameter of the bookingpress_form shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.21 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization of the `category` parameter within the `bookingpress_form` shortcode. This lack of proper escaping and sanitization allows for the injection of arbitrary SQL code into existing queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The core vulnerability is an SQL injection flaw. User-supplied input is directly incorporated into SQL queries without adequate sanitization.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize the `category` parameter before using it in a database query.
*  **Lack of Prepared Statements:** The SQL queries lack sufficient preparation (e.g., usage of prepared statements), which prevents the database engine from distinguishing between SQL code and user input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to extract sensitive information from the database. This could include user data, booking details, configuration settings, or any other data stored in the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Shortcode Parameter:** The vulnerability is triggered through the 'category' parameter of the 'bookingpress\_form' shortcode. This parameter is not properly sanitized before being used in a SQL query.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authentication:** Attackers need to be authenticated WordPress users with at least Contributor-level access. This indicates that the vulnerability is not exploitable by anonymous users or those with very low privileges.
*   **Ability to insert Shortcodes:** The attacker needs to have the ability to insert WordPress shortcodes into content or page, therefore needing to be at least a contributor.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is located in the `bookingpress-appointment-booking` plugin.
*   The vulnerable code is located in the `class.bookingpress_appointment_bookings.php` file within the plugin.
*   The vulnerability has been patched in version 1.1.22 of the plugin.
*   The provided Trac changeset highlights changes made to `class.bookingpress_appointment_bookings.php`, but doesn't directly show the SQL injection fix itself.
