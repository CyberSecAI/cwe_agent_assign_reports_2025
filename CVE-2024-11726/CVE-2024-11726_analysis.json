  "cve_id": "CVE-2024-11726",
  "description": "The Appointment Booking Calendar Plugin and Scheduling Plugin BookingPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the category parameter of the bookingpress_form shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.21 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.",
  "key_phrases": {
    "rootcause": "insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query",
    "weakness": "SQL injection",

      "Scheduling Plugin BookingPress plugin for WordPress",

    ],
    "version": "up to and including 1.1.21",
    "component": "bookingpress_form shortcode category parameter"
  },
  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization of the `category` parameter within the `bookingpress_form` shortcode. This lack of proper escaping and sanitization allows for the injection of arbitrary SQL code into existing queries.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n*   **SQL Injection:** The core vulnerability is an SQL injection flaw. User-supplied input is directly incorporated into SQL queries without adequate sanitization.\n*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize the `category` parameter before using it in a database query.\n*  **Lack of Prepared Statements:** The SQL queries lack sufficient preparation (e.g., usage of prepared statements), which prevents the database engine from distinguishing between SQL code and user input.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n*   **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to extract sensitive information from the database. This could include user data, booking details, configuration settings, or any other data stored in the database.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n*   **Shortcode Parameter:** The vulnerability is triggered through the 'category' parameter of the 'bookingpress\\_form' shortcode. This parameter is not properly sanitized before being used in a SQL query.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n*   **Authentication:** Attackers need to be authenticated WordPress users with at least Contributor-level access. This indicates that the vulnerability is not exploitable by anonymous users or those with very low privileges.\n*   **Ability to insert Shortcodes:** The attacker needs to have the ability to insert WordPress shortcodes into content or page, therefore needing to be at least a contributor.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n*   The vulnerability is located in the `bookingpress-appointment-booking` plugin.\n*   The vulnerable code is located in the `class.bookingpress_appointment_bookings.php` file within the plugin.\n*   The vulnerability has been patched in version 1.1.22 of the plugin.\n*   The provided Trac changeset highlights changes made to `class.bookingpress_appointment_bookings.php`, but doesn't directly show the SQL injection fix itself.",

Without sufficient removal or quoting of SQL syntax in user-controllable inputs, the generated SQL query can cause those inputs to be interpreted as SQL instead of ordinary user data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-96: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Statically Saved Code ('Static Code Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes code syntax before inserting the input into an executable resource, such as a library, configuration file, or template.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-93: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses CRLF (carriage return line feeds) as a special element, e.g. to separate lines or records, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CRLF sequences from inputs.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 1294.14\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
