While CWE-280 is related and also a good candidate, CWE-284 is more specific to the **improper access control** issue described. The weakness leads to potential data tampering or denial of service.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe280[\"CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges\"]\n    \n    cwe284 -->|PEEROF| cwe280\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe284 primary\n    class cwe280 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events starts with **improper access control**, leading to potential data tampering or denial of service.\n- Root Cause: **Improper Access Control**\n- Impact: Data Tampering, Denial of Service\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-284 as the primary candidate due to the explicit mention of \"**improper access control**\" in the vulnerability description. The retriever results and keyphrase analysis also strongly support this mapping. The provided evidence is strong, with the vulnerability description directly stating the **improper access control** issue. The relationship analysis further solidified the choice of CWE-284.
