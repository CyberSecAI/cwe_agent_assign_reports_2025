## Vulnerability Description
Tada5hi sp-common v0.5.4 was discovered to contain a **prototype pollution** via the function mergeDeep. This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a Denial of Service (DoS) via injecting arbitrary properties.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **prototype pollution**
- **impact:** arbitrary code execution and denial of service and execute arbitrary code
- **vector:** injecting arbitrary properties
- **attacker:** attackers
- **product:** Tada5hi sp-common
- **version:** v0.5.4
- **component:** mergeDeep function

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `mergeDeep` function in the `@abip/sp-common` package is vulnerable to prototype pollution.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The `mergeDeep` function does not properly sanitize or validate input, allowing an attacker to inject properties into the `Object.prototype` via the `__proto__` property.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Prototype pollution can lead to Denial of Service, Remote Code Execution, or Cross-Site Scripting attacks, depending on the specific application logic and how the polluted prototype is used.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker can call the vulnerable `mergeDeep` function with a crafted object containing the `__proto__` property.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to pass arguments to the vulnerable `mergeDeep` function. The specific capabilities depend on how the function is exposed within the application."
