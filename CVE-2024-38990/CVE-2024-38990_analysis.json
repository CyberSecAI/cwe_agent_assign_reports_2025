The evidence is strong, with the CVE summary explicitly stating the vulnerability lies in the `mergeDeep` function's failure to sanitize or validate input, leading to the ability to inject properties into `Object.prototype`. Other CWEs were considered, but CWE-1321 remains the most accurate and specific representation of the root cause.
