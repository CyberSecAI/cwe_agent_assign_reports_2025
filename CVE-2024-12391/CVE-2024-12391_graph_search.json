The function permits the execution of user-provided regular expressions. Certain regular expressions can cause the Python RE engine to take exponential time to execute, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition. An attacker who controls both the regular expression and the search string can exploit this vulnerability to hang the server for an arbitrary amount of time. Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-624 CWE-917 CWE-777 CWE-674 CWE-1333 CWE-185 CWE-617 CWE-625",
