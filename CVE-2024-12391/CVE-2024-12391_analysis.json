  "description": "A vulnerability in binary-husky/gpt_academic, as of commit 310122f, allows for a **Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attack**. The function permits the execution of user-provided regular expressions. Certain regular expressions can cause the Python RE engine to take exponential time to execute, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition. An attacker who controls both the regular expression and the search string can exploit this vulnerability to hang the server for an arbitrary amount of time.",

Several other CWEs were considered, particularly those related to regular expressions, such as CWE-185 (Incorrect Regular Expression) and CWE-625 (Permissive Regular Expression). However, CWE-1333 was chosen because the vulnerability description specifically mentions that certain regular expressions can cause the Python RE engine to take exponential time, which aligns directly with the description of CWE-1333.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1333[\"CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\"]\n    cwe185[\"CWE-185: Incorrect Regular Expression\"]\n    cwe625[\"CWE-625: Permissive Regular Expression\"]\n    \n    cwe625 -->|CHILDOF| cwe185\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1333 primary\n    class cwe185,cwe625 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **inefficient regular expression complexity** (CWE-1333). An attacker provides a specially crafted regular expression and search string. The Python RE engine then takes an excessive amount of time to process this, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary focus of the analysis was to identify the root cause of the vulnerability. The description explicitly mentions a **Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attack** and that the Python RE engine can take exponential time to execute certain regular expressions. This points directly to CWE-1333 (Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity).\n\nThe evidence from the vulnerability description is strong: \"The function permits the execution of user-provided regular expressions.
