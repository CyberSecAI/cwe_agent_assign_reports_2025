# Analysis Report for CVE-2025-46727

# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2025-46727

## Description

Rack is a modular Ruby web server interface. Prior to versions 2.2.14, 3.0.16, and 3.1.14, `RackQueryParser` parses query strings and `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` bodies into Ruby data structures without imposing any limit on the number of parameters, allowing attackers to send requests with extremely large numbers of parameters. The vulnerability arises because `RackQueryParser` iterates over each `&`-separated key-value pair and adds it to a Hash without enforcing an upper bound on the total number of parameters. This allows an attacker to send a single request containing hundreds of thousands (or more) of parameters, which consumes excessive memory and CPU during parsing. An attacker can trigger denial of service by sending specifically crafted HTTP requests, which can cause memory exhaustion or pin CPU resources, stalling or crashing the Rack server. This results in full service disruption until the affected worker is restarted. Versions 2.2.14, 3.0.16, and 3.1.14 fix the issue. Some other mitigations are available. One may use middleware to enforce a maximum query string size or parameter count, or employ a reverse proxy (such as Nginx) to limit request sizes and reject oversized query strings or bodies. Limiting request body sizes and query string lengths at the web server or CDN level is an effective mitigation.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis

The primary weakness is **Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling (CWE-770)**, because the RackQueryParser does not limit the number of parameters. **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400)** is a parent of CWE-770 and represents a broader class of resource consumption issues. **Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value (CWE-789)** is a child of CWE-770 and is about excessive memory allocation. **Improperly Controlled Sequential Memory Allocation (CWE-1325)** is a peer of CWE-789 and child of CWE-770 and is related to memory allocation. We choose CWE-770 as it accurately describes the core issue of allocating resources (parameters) without limits and causing resource exhaustion.

## Vulnerability Chain

The vulnerability chain begins with the **allocation of resources without limits (CWE-770)**. This leads to excessive memory and CPU consumption, which results in **uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400)**, and a denial-of-service condition. **Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value (CWE-789)** and **Improperly Controlled Sequential Memory Allocation (CWE-1325)** are secondary concerns as the root cause is not limiting the number of parameters, which then leads to memory being exhausted.

## Summary of Analysis

The primary weakness is the **lack of limits on the number of parameters parsed by RackQueryParser**, leading to excessive resource consumption and denial of service. The assessment is based on the vulnerability description, which explicitly mentions **parsing query strings and bodies without limit on the number of parameters**.

The graph relationships influenced the selection by highlighting the connections between resource allocation, memory consumption, and denial of service. CWE-770 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the root cause of allocating resources without limits.

Relevant CWE Information:

*   **CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling**: This CWE accurately describes the vulnerability. The RackQueryParser allocates resources (parameters) without imposing any limits, leading to excessive resource consumption.
*   **CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption**: While the vulnerability ultimately leads to uncontrolled resource consumption, CWE-400 is a broader class. CWE-770 is more specific to the root cause. The MITRE documentation discourages using Class level CWE's.
*   **CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value**: This CWE is about allocating memory with an excessive size value. While memory consumption is a consequence of the vulnerability, the root cause is the lack of limits on the number of parameters, not the size of the memory allocated.
*   **CWE-1325: Improperly Controlled Sequential Memory Allocation**: While this vulnerability results in many allocations, it is still best described as **CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling**.
