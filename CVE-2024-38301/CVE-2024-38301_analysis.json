Given the lack of detailed information pinpointing a precise cause, the general CWE-284 is chosen. However, since the vulnerability description also mentions information disclosure, CWE-497 is considered as a secondary weakness due to the impact of the **improper access control**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe497[\"CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\"]\n\n    cwe497 -->|IMPACT| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe284 primary\n    class cwe497 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper access control** (CWE-284), which allows a low-privileged attacker to perform actions they shouldn't. This leads to two impacts: denial of service and information disclosure (CWE-497).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified **improper access control** as the root cause, aligning with the provided vulnerability description. The selection is based on the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section, which explicitly mentions \"**improper access control**\" as the root cause. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" also supports this by stating the \"**Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper access control\". The retriever results also list CWE-284 as the top candidate.\n\nCWE-284 is chosen as the primary CWE due to the root cause being a high-level **improper access control** issue. CWE-497 is considered as a secondary CWE due to the information disclosure impact.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
