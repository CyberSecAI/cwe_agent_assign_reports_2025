CWE-770 is a parent of CWE-789 (Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value) and CWE-1325 (Improperly Controlled Sequential Memory Allocation), but those are specific to memory allocation. CWE-770 also a child of CWE-400, which describes the impact of the weakness, but CWE-770 is more specific to the root cause.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe789[\"CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\"]\n    cwe1325[\"CWE-1325: Improperly Controlled Sequential Memory Allocation\"]\n    \n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    cwe789 -->|CHILDOF| cwe770\n    cwe1325 -->|CHILDOF| cwe770\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe770 primary\n    class cwe400 secondary\n    class cwe789,cwe1325 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper restriction of log file size** (CWE-770), leading to a large amount of logged events, and finally resulting in the exhaustion of system resources and a denial of service condition (CWE-400).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the vulnerability description and the CVE reference summary, which clearly states that the application **does not properly restrict the size of generated log files**. This **weakness** allows an attacker to exhaust system resources.\n\nThe primary CWE is CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) because the root cause is the lack of restriction on the size of log files. The secondary CWE is CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) because the impact of the vulnerability is the exhaustion of system resources.\n\nI considered CWE-778 (Insufficient Logging), but it is not applicable because the issue is not about insufficient logging, but rather about the lack of control over the size of log files. CWE-789 (Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value) was considered, but it is specific to memory allocation, while this vulnerability affects log file sizes.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-778: Insufficient Logging\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nWhen a security-critical event occurs, the product either does not record the event or omits important details about the event when logging it.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
