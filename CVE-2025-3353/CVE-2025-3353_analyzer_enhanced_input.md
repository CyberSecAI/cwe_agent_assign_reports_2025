- **vector:** manipulation of cost argument
- **product:** PHPGurukul Men Salon Management System
- **version:** 1.0
- **component:** /admin/add-services.php

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
```text
**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is caused by the "cost" parameter in the '/admin/add-services.php' file of the 'Men Salon Management System' project, which allows attackers to inject malicious code. The input validation is insufficient, and user input from the 'cost' parameter is directly used in SQL queries without sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   SQL injection vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Attackers can gain unauthorized database access, potentially leading to sensitive data leakage, data tampering, comprehensive system control, and service interruption.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The vulnerability can be exploited by injecting malicious SQL queries through the 'cost' parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The content states that no login or authorization is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   The suggested repair is to use prepared statements and parameter binding, input validation and filtering, and to minimize database user permissions.
