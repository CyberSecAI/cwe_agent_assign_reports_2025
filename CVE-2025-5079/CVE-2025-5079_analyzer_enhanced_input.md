## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-5079 Content

The provided content **RELATES** to a SQL injection vulnerability. It details a vulnerability in the "Online Shopping Portal V1.0" software, specifically in the `/admin/updateorder.php` file. This is a distinct vulnerability and not directly related to a placeholder CVE description. The content provides more detail than a typical CVE description.

Here's a breakdown of the extracted information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient user input validation of the 'remark' parameter in the `/admin/updateorder.php` file. Malicious SQL queries can be injected through this parameter without proper cleaning or validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   SQL Injection

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Unauthorized database access
*   Sensitive data leakage
*   Data tampering
*   Comprehensive system control
*   Service interruption

**Attack vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is exploitable via a POST request to `/admin/updateorder.php` with a malicious payload in the 'remark' parameter.
*   No login or authorization is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint. No authentication is required.
*   Knowledge of SQL injection techniques is required to craft a successful payload.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   **Use prepared statements and parameter binding:** This separates SQL code from user input.
*   **Input validation and filtering:**  Strictly validate and filter user input.
*   **Minimize database user permissions:** Use accounts with the minimum necessary permissions.
*   **Regular security audits:** Conduct regular security audits to identify and fix vulnerabilities.

**Payload Example:**

```
Parameter: remark (POST)
    Type: time-based blind
    Title: MySQL >= 5.0.12 AND time-based blind (query SLEEP)
    Payload: status=in Process&remark=11' AND (SELECT 3848 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))Prwz) AND 'hoTl'='hoTl&submit2=update
