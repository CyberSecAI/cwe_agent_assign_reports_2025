  "query": "The vulnerability exists in the EJBCA service, version 8.0 Enterprise. Not tested in higher versions. By modifying the Host header in an HTTP request, it is possible to manipulate the generated links and thus redirect the client to a different base URL. In this way, an attacker could insert his own server for the client to send HTTP requests, provided he succeeds in exploiting it.",
