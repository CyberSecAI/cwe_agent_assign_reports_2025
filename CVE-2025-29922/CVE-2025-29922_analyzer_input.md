# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-29922

## Vulnerability Description
kcp is a Kubernetes-like control plane for form-factors and use-cases beyond Kubernetes and container workloads. Prior to 0.26.3, the identified vulnerability allows creating or deleting an object via the APIExport VirtualWorkspace in any arbitrary target workspace for pre-existing resources. By design, this should only be allowed when the workspace owner decides to give access to an API provider by creating an APIBinding. With this vulnerability, it is possible for an attacker to create and delete objects even if none of these requirements are satisfied, i.e. even if there is no APIBinding in that workspace at all or the workspace owner has created an APIBinding, but rejected a permission claim. A fix for this issue has been identified and has been published with kcp 0.26.3 and 0.27.0.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** create and delete objects
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** kcp
- **version:** Prior to 0.26.3
- **component:** APIExport VirtualWorkspace

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
CVE-2025-29922 - Unauthorized creation and deletion of objects in arbitrary workspaces through APIExport Virtual Workspace

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The `APIExport` Virtual Workspace allows managing objects in workspaces that bind to it, but the vulnerability allows creating or deleting objects in *any* target workspace, even without a valid APIBinding or accepted permission claim.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Insufficient authorization checks within the `APIExport` Virtual Workspace.
*   Bypassing of intended access control mechanisms related to APIBindings and permission claims.

**Impact of exploitation:**

An attacker can create and delete objects in arbitrary workspaces, potentially leading to data breaches, denial of service, or unauthorized modification of system configurations.

**Attack vectors:**

Exploitation occurs through the `APIExport` Virtual Workspace, allowing unauthorized object manipulation.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

The attacker needs access to utilize the `APIExport` Virtual Workspace.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   Upgrade to kcp 0.26.3 or 0.27.0, which include a fix for this issue.
*   As a workaround, minimize the number of users with `apiexport/content` sub-resource access to `APIExport` resources.
*   Implement filtering of incoming requests in a reverse proxy to enforce the authorizer logic from the referenced pull request.

**Additional details (more than official CVE description):**

*   The fix involves adding a `boundAPIAuthorizer` to the authorizer chain.
*   The vulnerability is categorized as Critical with a CVSS score of 9.6.
*   The vulnerability affects versions <= 0.26.1.
*   The pull request addressing the issue is #3338.
*   The vulnerability allows write access to APIBindings even from the virtual workspace, which is restricted to read-only access to prevent privilege escalation.
*   The reporter of the vulnerability is xmudrii.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set ‚Äì Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* üîç *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* üîç *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion ‚Äì CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### üî∏ CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ‚úÖ *‚ÄúA user created with the ‚Äòguest‚Äô role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.‚Äù*

#### üî∏ CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ‚úÖ *‚ÄúThe backup service runs as root but only needs read access.‚Äù*

#### üî∏ CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### üî∏ CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ‚úÖ *‚ÄúUser can access another user‚Äôs invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.‚Äù*

## Mapping Examples ‚Äì Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *‚ÄúUser can escalate privileges to admin.‚Äù*
> ‚ùå Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged ‚Äì only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ‚úÖ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**
