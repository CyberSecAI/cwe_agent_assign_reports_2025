The github issue provides more detail than a typical CVE description.\n\nHere's the extracted information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nAttackers inject malicious code from the 'sid' parameter and use it directly in SQL queries without appropriate cleaning or validation.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\nSQL injection\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\nUnauthorized database access, sensitive data leakage, data tampering, comprehensive system control, and service interruption.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\nThe '/pages/print.php?sid=9&cid=2' file is vulnerable. The 'sid' parameter is the entry point for the attack.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\nNo login or authorization is required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n*   Use prepared statements and parameter binding.\n*   Input validation and filtering.\n*   Minimize database user permissions.\n*   Regular security audits.\n\n**Payload examples (from the content):**\nSeveral payloads are provided for different types of SQL injection attacks (boolean-based blind, error-based, time-based blind, UNION query).  A sample payload is: `sid=9' AND 3398=3398 AND 'TVpZ'='TVpZ&cid=2`\n\n**Vulnerable File:**\n/pages/print.php?sid=9&cid=2\n\n**VERSION(S):**\nV1.0",
