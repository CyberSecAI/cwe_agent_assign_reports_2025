While CWE-359 is more specific, the provided vulnerability description only mentions \"user information leakage risks\" without specifying if it is private personal information. Therefore, I'm choosing the more general CWE-200 with the understanding that if more specific details were available, CWE-359 would be preferable.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe359[\"CWE-359: Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe359 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe359 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a logical flaw in the mobile application, which leads to the exposure of user information.\n\nLogical Flaw -> **Exposure of Sensitive Information** (CWE-200)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the **root cause** of the vulnerability based on the description provided. The description explicitly mentions \"user information leakage risks,\" which directly relates to the exposure of sensitive information.\n\nCWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) was selected as the primary CWE because it aligns with the described **impact** of the vulnerability. The retriever results also listed CWE-200 as the top candidate.\n\nCWE-359 (Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor) was considered as a more specific alternative since it is a child of CWE-200. However, the vulnerability description lacks the specificity to confirm whether the leaked information is \"private personal information.\"\n\nUltimately, CWE-200 was chosen due to its broader applicability to the available evidence. If there were more details in the Vulnerability Description Key Phrases about the type of user information, the mapping could be refined to CWE-359.\n\nThe evidence is relatively weak because the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" is unrelated. Therefore, the confidence is not at its highest.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-200 is commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error. As of CWE 4.9, over 400 CWE entries can lead to a loss of confidentiality. Other options are often available.
