  "description": "**Uncontrolled Resource Consumption** vulnerability in Apache Commons Configuration 1.x. There are a number of issues in Apache Commons Configuration 1.x that allow excessive resource consumption when loading untrusted configurations or using unexpected usage patterns. The Apache Commons Configuration team does not intend to fix these issues in 1.x. Apache Commons Configuration 1.x is still safe to use in scenarios where you only load trusted configurations. Users that load untrusted configurations or give attackers control over usage patterns are recommended to upgrade to the 2.x version line, which fixes these issues. Apache Commons Configuration 2.x is not a drop-in replacement, but as it uses a separate Maven groupId and Java package namespace they can be loaded side-by-side, making it possible to do a gradual migration.",

CWE-770, **Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling**, is a Base-level CWE and a child of CWE-664 (**Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime**), which is a Pillar. CWE-789, **Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value** is a Variant, PEEROF CWE-1325 (**Improperly Controlled Sequential Memory Allocation**), and CHILDOF CWE-770. Due to the lack of specific information in the vulnerability description, the higher-level CWE-400 is chosen as the primary, but CWE-770 and CWE-789 are considered as secondary candidates because they provide more specific potential causes for the uncontrolled resource consumption.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe789[\"CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\"]\n    cwe664[\"CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime\"]\n    cwe1325[\"CWE-1325: Improperly Controlled Sequential Memory Allocation\"]\n\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe664\n    cwe789 -->|CHILDOF| cwe770\n    cwe1325 -->|PEEROF| cwe789\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe400 primary\n    class cwe770,cwe789 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the **uncontrolled resource consumption** (**CWE-400**). This can stem from **allocation of resources without limits or throttling** (**CWE-770**) or **memory allocation with an excessive size value** (**CWE-789**). The final impact is the excessive resource consumption, potentially leading to denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary assessment is based on the vulnerability description stating \"**Uncontrolled Resource Consumption** vulnerability in Apache Commons Configuration 1.x\". This directly aligns with CWE-400 (**Uncontrolled Resource Consumption**).\n\nThe retriever results and relationship analysis provide supporting context. While CWE-400 is a Class-level CWE and the mapping guidance discourages its use, the provided information is insufficient to pinpoint a more specific Base or Variant CWE with high confidence. CWE-770 and CWE-789 are considered secondary candidates as potential root causes contributing to the uncontrolled resource consumption.\n\nThe selection of CWE-400 is justified due to the explicit mention of \"uncontrolled resource consumption\" in the vulnerability description. The lack of specific details about the root cause prevents selecting a more granular CWE. The relationship analysis highlights potential child CWEs like CWE-770 and CWE-789, but these are considered secondary candidates due to insufficient evidence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification)\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly control situations in which an adversary can cause the product to consume or produce excessive resources without requiring the adversary to invest equivalent work or otherwise prove authorization, i.e., the adversary's influence is \"asymmetric.\"\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
