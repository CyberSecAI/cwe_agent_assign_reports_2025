However it fails to correctly handle any errors that may occur while parsing the issuer field (which might occur if the issuer field is maliciously constructed). This may subsequently result in a NULL pointer deref and a crash leading to a potential denial of service attack. The function X509_issuer_and_serial_hash() is never directly called by OpenSSL itself so applications are only vulnerable if they use this function directly and they use it on certificates that may have been obtained from untrusted sources. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1i and below are affected by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1j. OpenSSL versions 1.0.2x and below are affected by this issue. However OpenSSL 1.0.2 is out of support and no longer receiving public updates. Premium support customers of OpenSSL 1.0.2 should upgrade to 1.0.2y. Other users should upgrade to 1.1.1j.

When restoring tensors via raw APIs, if the tensor name is not provided, TensorFlow can be tricked into dereferencing a null pointer. Alternatively, attackers can read memory outside the bounds of heap allocated data by providing some tensor names but not enough for a successful restoration. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/47a06f40411a69c99f381495f490536972152ac0/tensorflow/core/kernels/save_restore_tensor.cc#L158-L159) retrieves the tensor list corresponding to the `tensor_name` user controlled input and immediately retrieves the tensor at the restoration index (controlled via `preferred_shard` argument). This occurs without validating that the provided list has enough values. If the list is empty this results in dereferencing a null pointer (undefined behavior). If, however, the list has some elements, if the restoration index is outside the bounds this results in heap OOB read. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 9e82dce6e6bd1f36a57e08fa85af213e2b2f2622. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0.

This could cause the product to read from or write to unexpected memory locations, leading to a denial of service.

If an attacker can force the function to fail or otherwise return a value that is not expected, then the subsequent program logic could lead to a vulnerability, because the product is not in a state that the programmer assumes. For example, if the program calls a function to drop privileges but does not check the return code to ensure that privileges were successfully dropped, then the program will continue to operate with the higher privileges.\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-17533: Chain: unchecked return value (CWE-252) of some functions for policy enforcement leads to authorization bypass (CWE-862)\n\n- CVE-2020-6078: Chain: The return value of a function returning a pointer is not checked for success (CWE-252) resulting in the later use of an uninitialized variable (CWE-456) and a null pointer dereference (CWE-476)\n\n- CVE-2019-15900: Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).\n\n- CVE-2007-3798: Unchecked return value leads to resultant integer overflow and code execution.\n\n- CVE-2006-4447: Program does not check return value when invoking functions to drop privileges, which could leave users with higher privileges than expected by forcing those functions to fail.\n\n- CVE-2006-2916: Program does not check return value when invoking functions to drop privileges, which could leave users with higher privileges than expected by forcing those functions to fail.\n\n- CVE-2008-5183: chain: unchecked return value can lead to NULL dereference\n\n- CVE-2010-0211: chain: unchecked return value (CWE-252) leads to free of invalid, uninitialized pointer (CWE-824).\n\n- CVE-2017-6964: Linux-based device mapper encryption program does not check the return value of setuid and setgid allowing attackers to execute code with unintended privileges.\n\n- CVE-2002-1372: Chain: Return values of file/socket operations are not checked (CWE-252), allowing resultant consumption of file descriptors (CWE-772).\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-28875: In the standard library in Rust before 1.50.0, read_to_end() does not validate the return value from Read in an unsafe context.

In versions 0.20210107 and prior of HyperKit, the implementation of `qnotify` at `pci_vtrnd_notify` fails to check the return value of `vq_getchain`. This leads to `struct iovec iov;` being uninitialized and used to read memory in `len = (int) read(sc->vrsc_fd, iov.iov_base, iov.iov_len);` when an attacker is able to make `vq_getchain` fail. This issue may lead to a guest crashing the host causing a denial of service and, under certain circumstance, memory corruption.

The \"handle\" in the untrusted area is replaced in one function, but not another - thus also, effectively, exposure to wrong sphere (CWE-668).\n\n- CVE-2009-1719: Untrusted dereference using undocumented constructor.\n\n- CVE-2009-1250: An error code is incorrectly checked and interpreted as a pointer, leading to a crash.\n\n- CVE-2009-0311: An untrusted value is obtained from a packet and directly called as a function pointer, leading to code execution.\n\n- CVE-2010-1818: Undocumented attribute in multimedia software allows \"unmarshaling\" of an untrusted pointer.\n\n- CVE-2010-3189: ActiveX control for security software accepts a parameter that is assumed to be an initialized pointer.\n\n- CVE-2010-1253: Spreadsheet software treats certain record values that lead to \"user-controlled pointer\" (might be untrusted offset, not untrusted pointer).\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-22649: Luxion KeyShot versions prior to 10.1, Luxion KeyShot Viewer versions prior to 10.1, Luxion KeyShot Network Rendering versions prior to 10.1, and Luxion KeyVR versions prior to 10.1 have multiple NULL pointer dereference issues while processing project files, which may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.\n\n- CVE-2021-40157: A user may be tricked into opening a malicious FBX file which may exploit an Untrusted Pointer Dereference vulnerability in FBX\u2019s Review version 1.5.0 and prior causing it to run arbitrary code on the system.\n\n- CVE-2021-1973: A FTM Diag command can allow an arbitrary write into modem OS space in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon IoT, Snapdragon Mobile, Snapdragon Voice & Music, Snapdragon Wearables\n\n- CVE-2021-20239: A flaw was found in the Linux kernel in versions before 5.4.92 in the BPF protocol.

This vulnerability can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS).\n\n- CVE-2021-46243: An untrusted pointer dereference vulnerability exists in HDF5 v1.13.1-1 via the function H5O__dtype_decode_helper () at hdf5/src/H5Odtype.c. This vulnerability can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS).\n\n- CVE-2021-46020: An untrusted pointer dereference in mrb_vm_exec() of mruby v3.0.0 can lead to a segmentation fault or application crash.\n\n- CVE-2021-46023: An Untrusted Pointer Dereference was discovered in function mrb_vm_exec in mruby before 3.1.0-rc. The vulnerability causes a segmentation fault and application crash.\n\n- CVE-2022-22098: Memory corruption in multimedia driver due to untrusted pointer dereference while reading data from socket in Snapdragon Auto\n\n- CVE-2022-25661: Memory corruption due to untrusted pointer dereference in kernel in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Mobile\n\n- CVE-2022-25658: Memory corruption due to incorrect pointer arithmetic when attempting to change the endianness in video parser function in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Mobile, Snapdragon Voice & Music, Snapdragon Wearables\n\n- CVE-2021-41837: An issue was discovered in AhciBusDxe in the kernel 5.0 through 5.5 in Insyde InsydeH2O. Because of an Untrusted Pointer Dereference that causes SMM memory corruption, an attacker may be able to write fixed or predictable data to SMRAM. Exploiting this issue could lead to escalating privileges to SMM.\n\n- CVE-2021-41839: An issue was discovered in NvmExpressDxe in the kernel 5.0 through 5.5 in Insyde InsydeH2O. Because of an Untrusted Pointer Dereference that causes SMM memory corruption, an attacker may be able to write fixed or predictable data to SMRAM.

The vulnerability is due to a logic error in how the software cryptography module handles specific types of decryption errors. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious packets over an established IPsec connection. A successful exploit could cause the device to crash, forcing it to reload. Important: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability would not cause a compromise of any encrypted data. Note: This vulnerability affects only Cisco ASA Software Release 9.16.1 and Cisco FTD Software Release 7.0.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-28090: Tor before 0.4.5.7 allows a remote attacker to cause Tor directory authorities to exit with an assertion failure, aka TROVE-2021-002.\n\n- CVE-2021-28543: Varnish varnish-modules before 0.17.1 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon restart) in some configurations. This does not affect organizations that only install the Varnish Cache product; however, it is common to install both Varnish Cache and varnish-modules. Specifically, an assertion failure or NULL pointer dereference can be triggered in Varnish Cache through the varnish-modules header.append() and header.copy() functions. For some Varnish Configuration Language (VCL) files, this gives remote clients an opportunity to cause a Varnish Cache restart. A restart reduces overall availability and performance due to an increased number of cache misses, and may cause higher load on backend servers.\n\n- CVE-2020-36382: OpenVPN Access Server 2.7.3 to 2.8.7 allows remote attackers to trigger an assert during the user authentication phase via incorrect authentication token data in an early phase of the user authentication resulting in a denial of service.\n\n- CVE-2020-1681: Receipt of a specifically malformed NDP packet sent from the local area network (LAN) to a device running Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved can cause the ndp process to crash, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). The process automatically restarts without intervention, but a continuous receipt of the malformed NDP packets could leaded to an extended Denial of Service condition. During this time, IPv6 neighbor learning will be affected. The issue occurs when parsing the incoming malformed NDP packet. Rather than simply discarding the packet, the process asserts, performing a controlled exit and restart, thereby avoiding any chance of an unhandled exception. Exploitation of this vulnerability is limited to a temporary denial of service, and cannot be leveraged to cause additional impact on the system. This issue is limited to the processing of IPv6 NDP packets. IPv4 packet processing cannot trigger, and is unaffected by this vulnerability. This issue affects all Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved versions prior to 20.1R2-EVO. Junos OS is unaffected by this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2021-30501: An assertion abort was found in upx MemBuffer::alloc() in mem.cpp, in version UPX 4.0.0. The flow allows attackers to cause a denial of service (abort) via a crafted file.\n\n- CVE-2022-31620: In libjpeg before 1.64, BitStream<false>::Get in bitstream.hpp has an assertion failure that may cause denial of service. This is related to out-of-bounds array access during arithmetically coded lossless scan or arithmetically coded sequential scan.\n\n- CVE-2022-31100: rulex is a new, portable, regular expression language. When parsing untrusted rulex expressions, rulex may crash, possibly enabling a Denial of Service attack. This happens when the expression contains a multi-byte UTF-8 code point in a string literal or after a backslash, because rulex tries to slice into the code point and panics as a result. This is a security concern for you, if your service parses untrusted rulex expressions (expressions provided by an untrusted user), and your service becomes unavailable when the thread running rulex panics. The crashes are fixed in version **0.4.3**. Affected users are advised to update to this version. The only known workaround for this issue is to assume that regular expression parsing will panic and to add logic to catch panics.\n\n- CVE-2022-3488: Processing of repeated responses to the same query, where both responses contain ECS pseudo-options, but where the first is broken in some way, can cause BIND to exit with an assertion failure. 'Broken' in this context is anything that would cause the resolver to reject the query response, such as a mismatch between query and answer name. This issue affects BIND 9 versions 9.11.4-S1 through 9.11.37-S1 and 9.16.8-S1 through 9.16.36-S1.\n\n- CVE-2022-36004: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. When `tf.random.gamma` receives large input shape and rates, it gives a `CHECK` fail that can trigger a denial of service attack. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 552bfced6ce4809db5f3ca305f60ff80dd40c5a3. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.10.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.9.1, TensorFlow 2.8.1, and TensorFlow 2.7.2, as these are also affected and still in supported range. There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-48363: In MPD before 0.23.8, as used on Automotive Grade Linux and other platforms, the PipeWire output plugin mishandles a Drain call in certain situations involving truncated files. Eventually there is an assertion failure in libmpdclient because libqtappfw passes in a NULL pointer.\n\n- CVE-2022-23572: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. Under certain scenarios, TensorFlow can fail to specialize a type during shape inference. This case is covered by the `DCHECK` function however, `DCHECK` is a no-op in production builds and an assertion failure in debug builds. In the first case execution proceeds to the `ValueOrDie` line. This results in an assertion failure as `ret` contains an error `Status`, not a value. In the second case we also get a crash due to the assertion failure. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, and TensorFlow 2.6.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2021-46784: In Squid 3.x through 3.5.28, 4.x through 4.17, and 5.x before 5.6, due to improper buffer management, a Denial of Service can occur when processing long Gopher server responses.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-670 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-670 (ChildOf)",

In affected versions the implementation for `tf.raw_ops.BoostedTreesCreateEnsemble` can result in a use after free error if an attacker supplies specially crafted arguments. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/f24faa153ad31a4b51578f8181d3aaab77a1ddeb/tensorflow/core/kernels/boosted_trees/resource_ops.cc#L55) uses a reference counted resource and decrements the refcount if the initialization fails, as it should. However, when the code was written, the resource was represented as a naked pointer but later refactoring has changed it to be a smart pointer. Thus, when the pointer leaves the scope, a subsequent `free`-ing of the resource occurs, but this fails to take into account that the refcount has already reached 0, thus the resource has been already freed. During this double-free process, members of the resource object are accessed for cleanup but they are invalid as the entire resource has been freed. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 5ecec9c6fbdbc6be03295685190a45e7eee726ab. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0.

In Syncthing before version 1.15.0, the relay server `strelaysrv` can be caused to crash and exit by sending a relay message with a negative length field. Similarly, Syncthing itself can crash for the same reason if given a malformed message from a malicious relay server when attempting to join the relay.

Modules for TCP syslog reception have a potential heap buffer overflow when octet-counted framing is used. This can result in a segfault or some other malfunction. As of our understanding, this vulnerability can not be used for remote code execution. But there may still be a slight chance for experts to do that. The bug occurs when the octet count is read. While there is a check for the maximum number of octets, digits are written to a heap buffer even when the octet count is over the maximum, This can be used to overrun the memory buffer. However, once the sequence of digits stop, no additional characters can be added to the buffer. In our opinion, this makes remote exploits impossible or at least highly complex. Octet-counted framing is one of two potential framing modes. It is relatively uncommon, but enabled by default on receivers. Modules `imtcp`, `imptcp`, `imgssapi`, and `imhttp` are used for regular syslog message reception. It is best practice not to directly expose them to the public. When this practice is followed, the risk is considerably lower. Module `imdiag` is a diagnostics module primarily intended for testbench runs. We do not expect it to be present on any production installation. Octet-counted framing is not very common. Usually, it needs to be specifically enabled at senders. If users do not need it, they can turn it off for the most important modules. This will mitigate the vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2022-25727: Memory Corruption in modem due to improper length check while copying into memory in Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Voice & Music\n\n- CVE-2022-25793: A Stack-based Buffer Overflow Vulnerability in Autodesk 3ds Max 2022, 2021, and 2020 may lead to code execution through the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer when parsing ActionScript Byte Code files.

Azure RTOS USBX implementation of host support for USB CDC ECM includes an integer underflow and a buffer overflow in the `_ux_host_class_cdc_ecm_mac_address_get` function which may be potentially exploited to achieve remote code execution or denial of service. Setting mac address string descriptor length to a `0` or `1` allows an attacker to introduce an integer underflow followed (string_length) by a buffer overflow of the `cdc_ecm -> ux_host_class_cdc_ecm_node_id` array. This may allow one to redirect the code execution flow or introduce a denial of service. The fix has been included in USBX release [6.1.12](https://github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/releases/tag/v6.1.12_rel). Improved mac address string descriptor length validation to check for unexpectedly small values may be used as a workaround.\n\n- CVE-2022-36620: D-link DIR-816 A2_v1.10CNB04, DIR-878 DIR_878_FW1.30B08.img is vulnerable to Buffer Overflow via /goform/addRouting.\n\n- CVE-2022-37134: D-link DIR-816 A2_v1.10CNB04.img is vulnerable to Buffer Overflow via /goform/form2Wan.cgi.

In affected versions the Istio control plane, `istiod`, is vulnerable to a request processing error, allowing a malicious attacker that sends a specially crafted message which results in the control plane crashing. This endpoint is served over TLS port 15012, but does not require any authentication from the attacker. For simple installations, Istiod is typically only reachable from within the cluster, limiting the blast radius. However, for some deployments, especially [multicluster](https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/install/multicluster/primary-remote/) topologies, this port is exposed over the public internet. There are no effective workarounds, beyond upgrading. Limiting network access to Istiod to the minimal set of clients can help lessen the scope of the vulnerability to some extent.\n\n- CVE-2021-31556: An issue was discovered in the Oauth extension for MediaWiki through 1.35.2.

A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute code on the affected device and cause LLDP to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\n\n- CVE-2022-20385: a function called 'nla_parse', do not check the len of para, it will check nla_type (which can be controlled by userspace) with 'maxtype' (in this case, it is GSCAN_MAX), then it access polciy array 'policy[type]', which OOB access happens.Product: AndroidVersions: Android SoCAndroid ID: A-238379819\n\n- CVE-2022-26125: Buffer overflow vulnerabilities exist in FRRouting through 8.1.0 due to wrong checks on the input packet length in isisd/isis_tlvs.c.\n\n- CVE-2022-26127: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in FRRouting through 8.1.0 due to missing a check on the input packet length in the babel_packet_examin function in babeld/message.c.\n\n- CVE-2022-26128: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in FRRouting through 8.1.0 due to a wrong check on the input packet length in the babel_packet_examin function in babeld/message.c.\n\n- CVE-2022-36086: linked_list_allocator is an allocator usable for no_std systems. Prior to version 0.10.2, the heap initialization methods were missing a minimum size check for the given heap size argument. This could lead to out-of-bound writes when a heap was initialized with a size smaller than `3 * size_of::<usize>` because of metadata write operations. This vulnerability impacts all the initialization functions on the `Heap` and `LockedHeap` types, including `Heap::new`, `Heap::init`, `Heap::init_from_slice`, and `LockedHeap::new`. It also affects multiple uses of the `Heap::extend` method. Version 0.10.2 contains a patch for the issue. As a workaround, ensure that the heap is only initialized with a size larger than `3 * size_of::<usize>` and that the `Heap::extend` method is only called with sizes larger than `2 * size_of::<usize>()`. Also, ensure that the total heap size is (and stays) a multiple of `2 * size_of::<usize>()`.\n\n- CVE-2022-36938: DexLoader function get_stringidx_fromdex() in Redex prior to commit 3b44c64 can load an out of bound address when loading the string index table, potentially allowing remote code execution during processing of a 3rd party Android APK file.\n\n- CVE-2021-1058: NVIDIA vGPU software contains a vulnerability in the guest kernel mode driver and vGPU plugin, in which an input data size is not validated, which may lead to tampering of data or denial of service.

In affected versions an attacker can trigger a denial of service via a segmentation fault in `tf.raw_ops.MaxPoolGrad` caused by missing validation. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/460e000de3a83278fb00b61a16d161b1964f15f4/tensorflow/core/kernels/maxpooling_op.cc) misses some validation for the `orig_input` and `orig_output` tensors. The fixes for CVE-2021-29579 were incomplete. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 136b51f10903e044308cf77117c0ed9871350475. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2021-37677: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions the shape inference code for `tf.raw_ops.Dequantize` has a vulnerability that could trigger a denial of service via a segfault if an attacker provides invalid arguments. The shape inference [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/460e000de3a83278fb00b61a16d161b1964f15f4/tensorflow/core/ops/array_ops.cc#L2999-L3014) uses `axis` to select between two different values for `minmax_rank` which is then used to retrieve tensor dimensions. However, code assumes that `axis` can be either `-1` or a value greater than `-1`, with no validation for the other values. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit da857cfa0fde8f79ad0afdbc94e88b5d4bbec764. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2021-39193: Frontier is Substrate's Ethereum compatibility layer. Prior to commit number 0b962f218f0cdd796dadfe26c3f09e68f7861b26, a bug in `pallet-ethereum` can cause invalid transactions to be included in the Ethereum block state in `pallet-ethereum` due to not validating the input data size. Any invalid transactions included this way have no possibility to alter the internal Ethereum or Substrate state. The transaction will appear to have be included, but is of no effect as it is rejected by the EVM engine. The impact is further limited by Substrate extrinsic size constraints.

During shape inference, TensorFlow can allocate a large vector based on a value from a tensor controlled by the user. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2022-29202: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, the implementation of `tf.ragged.constant` does not fully validate the input arguments. This results in a denial of service by consuming all available memory. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-36078: Binary provides encoding/decoding in Borsh and other formats. The vulnerability is a memory allocation vulnerability that can be exploited to allocate slices in memory with (arbitrary) excessive size value, which can either exhaust available memory or crash the whole program. When using `github.com/gagliardetto/binary` to parse unchecked (or wrong type of) data from untrusted sources of input (e.g. the blockchain) into slices, it's possible to allocate memory with excessive size. When `dec.Decode(&val)` method is used to parse data into a structure that is or contains slices of values, the length of the slice was previously read directly from the data itself without any checks on the size of it, and then a slice was allocated. This could lead to an overflow and an allocation of memory with excessive size value. Users should upgrade to `v0.7.1` or higher. A workaround is not to rely on the `dec.Decode(&val)` function to parse the data, but to use a custom `UnmarshalWithDecoder()` method that reads and checks the length of any slice.\n\n- CVE-2022-37311: OX App Suite through 7.10.6 has Uncontrolled Resource Consumption via a large location request parameter to the redirect servlet.\n\n- CVE-2022-37312: OX App Suite through 7.10.6 has Uncontrolled Resource Consumption via a large request body containing a redirect URL to the deferrer servlet.\n\n- CVE-2022-39294: conduit-hyper integrates a conduit application with the hyper server. Prior to version 0.4.2, `conduit-hyper` did not check any limit on a request's length before calling [`hyper::body::to_bytes`](https://docs.rs/hyper/latest/hyper/body/fn.to_bytes.html). An attacker could send a malicious request with an abnormally large `Content-Length`, which could lead to a panic if memory allocation failed for that request. In version 0.4.2, `conduit-hyper` sets an internal limit of 128 MiB per request, otherwise returning status 400 (\"Bad Request\"). This crate is part of the implementation of Rust's [crates.io](https://crates.io/), but that service is not affected due to its existing cloud infrastructure, which already drops such malicious requests. Even with the new limit in place, `conduit-hyper` is not recommended for production use, nor to directly serve the public Internet.\n\n- CVE-2022-4111: Unrestricted file size limit can lead to DoS in tooljet/tooljet <1.27 by allowing a logged in attacker to upload profile pictures over 2MB. \n\n- CVE-2022-41968: Nextcloud Server is an open source personal cloud server.

This vulnerability is due to missing length validation of certain Cisco Discovery Protocol packet header fields. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted Cisco Discovery Protocol packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to exhaust available memory and cause the service to restart. Cisco has released firmware updates that address this vulnerability. \n\n- CVE-2022-21208: The package node-opcua before 2.74.0 are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) due to a missing limitation on the number of received chunks - per single session or in total for all concurrent sessions. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending an unlimited number of huge chunks (e.g. 2GB each) without sending the Final closing chunk.\n\n- CVE-2022-29212: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, certain TFLite models that were created using TFLite model converter would crash when loaded in the TFLite interpreter. The culprit is that during quantization the scale of values could be greater than 1 but code was always assuming sub-unit scaling. Thus, since code was calling `QuantizeMultiplierSmallerThanOneExp`, the `TFLITE_CHECK_LT` assertion would trigger and abort the process. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-29196: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.Conv3DBackpropFilterV2` does not fully validate the input arguments. This results in a `CHECK`-failure which can be used to trigger a denial of service attack. The code does not validate that the `filter_sizes` argument is a vector. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-29200: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.LSTMBlockCell` does not fully validate the input arguments. This results in a `CHECK`-failure which can be used to trigger a denial of service attack. The code does not validate the ranks of any of the arguments to this API call. This results in `CHECK`-failures when the elements of the tensor are accessed. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-20 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-20 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-789 (CanPrecede)",

They generally contain junk data with the contents of stack memory before the function was invoked. An attacker can sometimes control or read these contents. In other languages or conditions, a variable that is not explicitly initialized can be given a default value that has security implications, depending on the logic of the program. The presence of an uninitialized variable can sometimes indicate a typographic error in the code.\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2019-15900: Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).\n\n- CVE-2008-3688: Chain: A denial of service may be caused by an uninitialized variable (CWE-457) allowing an infinite loop (CWE-835) resulting from a connection to an unresponsive server.\n\n- CVE-2008-0081: Uninitialized variable leads to code execution in popular desktop application.\n\n- CVE-2007-4682: Crafted input triggers dereference of an uninitialized object pointer.\n\n- CVE-2007-3468: Crafted audio file triggers crash when an uninitialized variable is used.\n\n- CVE-2007-2728: Uninitialized random seed variable used.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-1619: A vulnerability in the authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) function of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass NETCONF or RESTCONF authentication and do either of the following: Install, manipulate, or delete the configuration of an affected device Cause memory corruption that results in a denial of service (DoS) on an affected device This vulnerability is due to an uninitialized variable. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of NETCONF or RESTCONF requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to use NETCONF or RESTCONF to install, manipulate, or delete the configuration of a network device or to corrupt memory on the device, resulting a DoS.\n\n- CVE-2021-41253: Zydis is an x86/x86-64 disassembler library. Users of Zydis versions v3.2.0 and older that use the string functions provided in `zycore` in order to append untrusted user data to the formatter buffer within their custom formatter hooks can run into heap buffer overflows. Older versions of Zydis failed to properly initialize the string object within the formatter buffer, forgetting to initialize a few fields, leaving their value to chance. This could then in turn cause zycore functions like `ZyanStringAppend` to make incorrect calculations for the new target size, resulting in heap memory corruption. This does not affect the regular uncustomized Zydis formatter, because Zydis internally doesn't use the string functions in zycore that act upon these fields. However, because the zycore string functions are the intended way to work with the formatter buffer for users of the library that wish to extend the formatter, we still consider this to be a vulnerability in Zydis. This bug is patched starting in version 3.2.1. As a workaround, users may refrain from using zycore string functions in their formatter hooks until updating to a patched version.\n\n- CVE-2021-21140: Uninitialized use in USB in Google Chrome prior to 88.0.4324.96 allowed a local attacker to potentially perform out of bounds memory access via via a USB device.\n\n- CVE-2021-44003: A vulnerability has been identified in JT2Go (All versions < V13.2.0.5), Teamcenter Visualization (All versions < V13.2.0.5). The Tiff_Loader.dll is vulnerable to use of uninitialized memory while parsing user supplied TIFF files. This could allow an attacker to cause a denial-of-service condition.\n\n- CVE-2022-31741: A crafted CMS message could have been processed incorrectly, leading to an invalid memory read, and potentially further memory corruption. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 91.10, Firefox < 101, and Firefox ESR < 91.10.\n\n- CVE-2021-35991: Adobe Bridge version 11.0.2 (and earlier) is affected by an Access of Uninitialized Pointer vulnerability when parsing a specially crafted file.

The implementation of `tf.io.decode_raw` produces incorrect results and crashes the Python interpreter when combining `fixed_length` and wider datatypes. The implementation of the padded version(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1d8903e5b167ed0432077a3db6e462daf781d1fe/tensorflow/core/kernels/decode_padded_raw_op.cc) is buggy due to a confusion about pointer arithmetic rules. First, the code computes(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1d8903e5b167ed0432077a3db6e462daf781d1fe/tensorflow/core/kernels/decode_padded_raw_op.cc#L61) the width of each output element by dividing the `fixed_length` value to the size of the type argument. The `fixed_length` argument is also used to determine the size needed for the output tensor(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1d8903e5b167ed0432077a3db6e462daf781d1fe/tensorflow/core/kernels/decode_padded_raw_op.cc#L63-L79). This is followed by reencoding code(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1d8903e5b167ed0432077a3db6e462daf781d1fe/tensorflow/core/kernels/decode_padded_raw_op.cc#L85-L94). The erroneous code is the last line above: it is moving the `out_data` pointer by `fixed_length * sizeof(T)` bytes whereas it only copied at most `fixed_length` bytes from the input. This results in parts of the input not being decoded into the output. Furthermore, because the pointer advance is far wider than desired, this quickly leads to writing to outside the bounds of the backing data. This OOB write leads to interpreter crash in the reproducer mentioned here, but more severe attacks can be mounted too, given that this gadget allows writing to periodically placed locations in memory. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2021-29947: Mozilla developers and community members reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 87.

If the dereferencing operation is for a read, then the attack might allow reading of sensitive data, cause a crash, or set a variable to an unexpected value (since the value will be read from an unexpected memory location).\n\n\nThere are several variants of this weakness, including but not necessarily limited to:\n\n\n  - The untrusted value is directly invoked as a function call.\n\n  - In OS kernels or drivers where there is a boundary between \"userland\" and privileged memory spaces, an untrusted pointer might enter through an API or system call (see CWE-781 for one such example).\n\n  - Inadvertently accepting the value from an untrusted control sphere when it did not have to be accepted as input at all. This might occur when the code was originally developed to be run by a single user in a non-networked environment, and the code is then ported to or otherwise exposed to a networked environment.\n\n",

If the dereferencing operation is for a read, then the attack might allow reading of sensitive data, cause a crash, or set a variable to an unexpected value (since the value will be read from an unexpected memory location).\n\n\nThere are several variants of this weakness, including but not necessarily limited to:\n\n\n  - The untrusted value is directly invoked as a function call.\n\n  - In OS kernels or drivers where there is a boundary between \"userland\" and privileged memory spaces, an untrusted pointer might enter through an API or system call (see CWE-781 for one such example).\n\n  - Inadvertently accepting the value from an untrusted control sphere when it did not have to be accepted as input at all. This might occur when the code was originally developed to be run by a single user in a non-networked environment, and the code is then ported to or otherwise exposed to a networked environment.\n\n",

However it fails to correctly handle any errors that may occur while parsing the issuer field (which might occur if the issuer field is maliciously constructed). This may subsequently result in a NULL pointer deref and a crash leading to a potential denial of service attack. The function X509_issuer_and_serial_hash() is never directly called by OpenSSL itself so applications are only vulnerable if they use this function directly and they use it on certificates that may have been obtained from untrusted sources. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1i and below are affected by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1j. OpenSSL versions 1.0.2x and below are affected by this issue.

When restoring tensors via raw APIs, if the tensor name is not provided, TensorFlow can be tricked into dereferencing a null pointer. Alternatively, attackers can read memory outside the bounds of heap allocated data by providing some tensor names but not enough for a successful restoration. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/47a06f40411a69c99f381495f490536972152ac0/tensorflow/core/kernels/save_restore_tensor.cc#L158-L159) retrieves the tensor list corresponding to the `tensor_name` user controlled input and immediately retrieves the tensor at the restoration index (controlled via `preferred_shard` argument). This occurs without validating that the provided list has enough values. If the list is empty this results in dereferencing a null pointer (undefined behavior). If, however, the list has some elements, if the restoration index is outside the bounds this results in heap OOB read. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 9e82dce6e6bd1f36a57e08fa85af213e2b2f2622. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0.

This could cause the product to read from or write to unexpected memory locations, leading to a denial of service. If the uninitialized pointer is used as a function call, then arbitrary functions could be invoked. If an attacker can influence the portion of uninitialized memory that is contained in the pointer, this weakness could be leveraged to execute code or perform other attacks.\n\n\nDepending on memory layout, associated memory management behaviors, and product operation, the attacker might be able to influence the contents of the uninitialized pointer, thus gaining more fine-grained control of the memory location to be accessed.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2024-32878: LLM product has a free of an uninitialized pointer\n\n- CVE-2010-0211: chain: unchecked return value (CWE-252) leads to free of invalid, uninitialized pointer (CWE-824).\n\n- CVE-2009-2768: Pointer in structure is not initialized, leading to NULL pointer dereference (CWE-476) and system crash.\n\n- CVE-2009-1721: Free of an uninitialized pointer.\n\n- CVE-2009-1415: Improper handling of invalid signatures leads to free of invalid pointer.\n\n- CVE-2009-0846: Invalid encoding triggers free of uninitialized pointer.\n\n- CVE-2009-0040: Crafted PNG image leads to free of uninitialized pointer.\n\n- CVE-2008-2934: Crafted GIF image leads to free of uninitialized pointer.\n\n- CVE-2007-4682: Access of uninitialized pointer might lead to code execution.\n\n- CVE-2007-4639: Step-based manipulation: invocation of debugging function before the primary initialization function leads to access of an uninitialized pointer and code execution.\n\n- CVE-2007-4000: Unchecked return values can lead to a write to an uninitialized pointer.\n\n- CVE-2007-2442: zero-length input leads to free of uninitialized pointer.\n\n- CVE-2007-1213: Crafted font leads to uninitialized function pointer.\n\n- CVE-2006-6143: Uninitialized function pointer in freed memory is invoked\n\n- CVE-2006-4175: LDAP server mishandles malformed BER queries, leading to free of uninitialized memory\n\n- CVE-2006-0054: Firewall can crash with certain ICMP packets that trigger access of an uninitialized pointer.\n\n- CVE-2003-1201: LDAP server does not initialize members of structs, which leads to free of uninitialized pointer if an LDAP request fails.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-3593: An invalid pointer initialization issue was found in the SLiRP networking implementation of QEMU.

If an attacker can force the function to fail or otherwise return a value that is not expected, then the subsequent program logic could lead to a vulnerability, because the product is not in a state that the programmer assumes. For example, if the program calls a function to drop privileges but does not check the return code to ensure that privileges were successfully dropped, then the program will continue to operate with the higher privileges.\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-17533: Chain: unchecked return value (CWE-252) of some functions for policy enforcement leads to authorization bypass (CWE-862)\n\n- CVE-2020-6078: Chain: The return value of a function returning a pointer is not checked for success (CWE-252) resulting in the later use of an uninitialized variable (CWE-456) and a null pointer dereference (CWE-476)\n\n- CVE-2019-15900: Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).\n\n- CVE-2007-3798: Unchecked return value leads to resultant integer overflow and code execution.\n\n- CVE-2006-4447: Program does not check return value when invoking functions to drop privileges, which could leave users with higher privileges than expected by forcing those functions to fail.\n\n- CVE-2006-2916: Program does not check return value when invoking functions to drop privileges, which could leave users with higher privileges than expected by forcing those functions to fail.\n\n- CVE-2008-5183: chain: unchecked return value can lead to NULL dereference\n\n- CVE-2010-0211: chain: unchecked return value (CWE-252) leads to free of invalid, uninitialized pointer (CWE-824).\n\n- CVE-2017-6964: Linux-based device mapper encryption program does not check the return value of setuid and setgid allowing attackers to execute code with unintended privileges.\n\n- CVE-2002-1372: Chain: Return values of file/socket operations are not checked (CWE-252), allowing resultant consumption of file descriptors (CWE-772).\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-28875: In the standard library in Rust before 1.50.0, read_to_end() does not validate the return value from Read in an unsafe context.

User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-195573629References: N/A\n\n- CVE-2021-0155: Unchecked return value in the BIOS firmware for some Intel(R) Processors may allow a privileged user to potentially enable information disclosure via local access.\n\n- CVE-2021-32845: HyperKit is a toolkit for embedding hypervisor capabilities in an application. In versions 0.20210107 and prior of HyperKit, the implementation of `qnotify` at `pci_vtrnd_notify` fails to check the return value of `vq_getchain`. This leads to `struct iovec iov;` being uninitialized and used to read memory in `len = (int) read(sc->vrsc_fd, iov.iov_base, iov.iov_len);` when an attacker is able to make `vq_getchain` fail. This issue may lead to a guest crashing the host causing a denial of service and, under certain circumstance, memory corruption.

The offset might be out-of-range if it comes from an untrusted source, is the result of an incorrect calculation, or occurs because of another error.\n\n\nIf an attacker can control or influence the offset so that it points outside of the intended boundaries of the structure, then the attacker may be able to read or write to memory locations that are used elsewhere in the product.

The vulnerability is due to a logic error in how the software cryptography module handles specific types of decryption errors. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious packets over an established IPsec connection. A successful exploit could cause the device to crash, forcing it to reload. Important: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability would not cause a compromise of any encrypted data. Note: This vulnerability affects only Cisco ASA Software Release 9.16.1 and Cisco FTD Software Release 7.0.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-28090: Tor before 0.4.5.7 allows a remote attacker to cause Tor directory authorities to exit with an assertion failure, aka TROVE-2021-002.\n\n- CVE-2021-28543: Varnish varnish-modules before 0.17.1 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon restart) in some configurations. This does not affect organizations that only install the Varnish Cache product; however, it is common to install both Varnish Cache and varnish-modules. Specifically, an assertion failure or NULL pointer dereference can be triggered in Varnish Cache through the varnish-modules header.append() and header.copy() functions. For some Varnish Configuration Language (VCL) files, this gives remote clients an opportunity to cause a Varnish Cache restart. A restart reduces overall availability and performance due to an increased number of cache misses, and may cause higher load on backend servers.\n\n- CVE-2020-36382: OpenVPN Access Server 2.7.3 to 2.8.7 allows remote attackers to trigger an assert during the user authentication phase via incorrect authentication token data in an early phase of the user authentication resulting in a denial of service.\n\n- CVE-2020-1681: Receipt of a specifically malformed NDP packet sent from the local area network (LAN) to a device running Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved can cause the ndp process to crash, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). The process automatically restarts without intervention, but a continuous receipt of the malformed NDP packets could leaded to an extended Denial of Service condition. During this time, IPv6 neighbor learning will be affected. The issue occurs when parsing the incoming malformed NDP packet. Rather than simply discarding the packet, the process asserts, performing a controlled exit and restart, thereby avoiding any chance of an unhandled exception. Exploitation of this vulnerability is limited to a temporary denial of service, and cannot be leveraged to cause additional impact on the system. This issue is limited to the processing of IPv6 NDP packets. IPv4 packet processing cannot trigger, and is unaffected by this vulnerability. This issue affects all Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved versions prior to 20.1R2-EVO. Junos OS is unaffected by this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2021-30501: An assertion abort was found in upx MemBuffer::alloc() in mem.cpp, in version UPX 4.0.0. The flow allows attackers to cause a denial of service (abort) via a crafted file.\n\n- CVE-2022-31620: In libjpeg before 1.64, BitStream<false>::Get in bitstream.hpp has an assertion failure that may cause denial of service. This is related to out-of-bounds array access during arithmetically coded lossless scan or arithmetically coded sequential scan.\n\n- CVE-2022-31100: rulex is a new, portable, regular expression language. When parsing untrusted rulex expressions, rulex may crash, possibly enabling a Denial of Service attack. This happens when the expression contains a multi-byte UTF-8 code point in a string literal or after a backslash, because rulex tries to slice into the code point and panics as a result. This is a security concern for you, if your service parses untrusted rulex expressions (expressions provided by an untrusted user), and your service becomes unavailable when the thread running rulex panics. The crashes are fixed in version **0.4.3**. Affected users are advised to update to this version. The only known workaround for this issue is to assume that regular expression parsing will panic and to add logic to catch panics.\n\n- CVE-2022-3488: Processing of repeated responses to the same query, where both responses contain ECS pseudo-options, but where the first is broken in some way, can cause BIND to exit with an assertion failure. 'Broken' in this context is anything that would cause the resolver to reject the query response, such as a mismatch between query and answer name. This issue affects BIND 9 versions 9.11.4-S1 through 9.11.37-S1 and 9.16.8-S1 through 9.16.36-S1.\n\n- CVE-2022-36004: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. When `tf.random.gamma` receives large input shape and rates, it gives a `CHECK` fail that can trigger a denial of service attack. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 552bfced6ce4809db5f3ca305f60ff80dd40c5a3. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.10.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.9.1, TensorFlow 2.8.1, and TensorFlow 2.7.2, as these are also affected and still in supported range. There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-48363: In MPD before 0.23.8, as used on Automotive Grade Linux and other platforms, the PipeWire output plugin mishandles a Drain call in certain situations involving truncated files. Eventually there is an assertion failure in libmpdclient because libqtappfw passes in a NULL pointer.\n\n- CVE-2022-23572: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. Under certain scenarios, TensorFlow can fail to specialize a type during shape inference. This case is covered by the `DCHECK` function however, `DCHECK` is a no-op in production builds and an assertion failure in debug builds. In the first case execution proceeds to the `ValueOrDie` line. This results in an assertion failure as `ret` contains an error `Status`, not a value. In the second case we also get a crash due to the assertion failure. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, and TensorFlow 2.6.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2021-46784: In Squid 3.x through 3.5.28, 4.x through 4.17, and 5.x before 5.6, due to improper buffer management, a Denial of Service can occur when processing long Gopher server responses.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-670 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-670 (ChildOf)",

This corruption can cause the program to crash or, in some circumstances, cause two later calls to malloc() to return the same pointer. If malloc() returns the same value twice and the program later gives the attacker control over the data that is written into this doubly-allocated memory, the program becomes vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack.\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2006-5051: Chain: Signal handler contains too much functionality (CWE-828), introducing a race condition (CWE-362) that leads to a double free (CWE-415).\n\n- CVE-2004-0642: Double free resultant from certain error conditions.\n\n- CVE-2004-0772: Double free resultant from certain error conditions.\n\n- CVE-2005-1689: Double free resultant from certain error conditions.\n\n- CVE-2003-0545: Double free from invalid ASN.1 encoding.\n\n- CVE-2003-1048: Double free from malformed GIF.\n\n- CVE-2005-0891: Double free from malformed GIF.\n\n- CVE-2002-0059: Double free from malformed compressed data.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-11231: Two threads call one or both functions concurrently leading to corruption of pointers and reference counters which in turn can lead to heap corruption in Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Mobile\n\n- CVE-2020-14354: A possible use-after-free and double-free in c-ares lib version 1.16.0 if ares_destroy() is called prior to ares_getaddrinfo() completing.

In affected versions the implementation for `tf.raw_ops.BoostedTreesCreateEnsemble` can result in a use after free error if an attacker supplies specially crafted arguments. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/f24faa153ad31a4b51578f8181d3aaab77a1ddeb/tensorflow/core/kernels/boosted_trees/resource_ops.cc#L55) uses a reference counted resource and decrements the refcount if the initialization fails, as it should. However, when the code was written, the resource was represented as a naked pointer but later refactoring has changed it to be a smart pointer. Thus, when the pointer leaves the scope, a subsequent `free`-ing of the resource occurs, but this fails to take into account that the refcount has already reached 0, thus the resource has been already freed. During this double-free process, members of the resource object are accessed for cleanup but they are invalid as the entire resource has been freed. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 5ecec9c6fbdbc6be03295685190a45e7eee726ab. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2020-14123: There is a pointer double free vulnerability in Some MIUI Services.

The vulnerability exists within the handling of an HTTP request. An attacker can leverage this to execute code as root. The problem is that a user-provided length value is trusted during a backup.cgi file upload. The attacker must add a \\\\n before the Content-Length header.\n\n- CVE-2021-37663: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions due to incomplete validation in `tf.raw_ops.QuantizeV2`, an attacker can trigger undefined behavior via binding a reference to a null pointer or can access data outside the bounds of heap allocated arrays.

In Syncthing before version 1.15.0, the relay server `strelaysrv` can be caused to crash and exit by sending a relay message with a negative length field. Similarly, Syncthing itself can crash for the same reason if given a malformed message from a malicious relay server when attempting to join the relay. Relay joins are essentially random (from a subset of low latency relays) and Syncthing will by default restart when crashing, at which point it's likely to pick another non-malicious relay.

Modules for TCP syslog reception have a potential heap buffer overflow when octet-counted framing is used. This can result in a segfault or some other malfunction. As of our understanding, this vulnerability can not be used for remote code execution. But there may still be a slight chance for experts to do that. The bug occurs when the octet count is read. While there is a check for the maximum number of octets, digits are written to a heap buffer even when the octet count is over the maximum, This can be used to overrun the memory buffer. However, once the sequence of digits stop, no additional characters can be added to the buffer. In our opinion, this makes remote exploits impossible or at least highly complex. Octet-counted framing is one of two potential framing modes. It is relatively uncommon, but enabled by default on receivers. Modules `imtcp`, `imptcp`, `imgssapi`, and `imhttp` are used for regular syslog message reception. It is best practice not to directly expose them to the public. When this practice is followed, the risk is considerably lower. Module `imdiag` is a diagnostics module primarily intended for testbench runs. We do not expect it to be present on any production installation. Octet-counted framing is not very common. Usually, it needs to be specifically enabled at senders. If users do not need it, they can turn it off for the most important modules. This will mitigate the vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2022-25727: Memory Corruption in modem due to improper length check while copying into memory in Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Voice & Music\n\n- CVE-2022-25793: A Stack-based Buffer Overflow Vulnerability in Autodesk 3ds Max 2022, 2021, and 2020 may lead to code execution through the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer when parsing ActionScript Byte Code files.

Azure RTOS USBX implementation of host support for USB CDC ECM includes an integer underflow and a buffer overflow in the `_ux_host_class_cdc_ecm_mac_address_get` function which may be potentially exploited to achieve remote code execution or denial of service. Setting mac address string descriptor length to a `0` or `1` allows an attacker to introduce an integer underflow followed (string_length) by a buffer overflow of the `cdc_ecm -> ux_host_class_cdc_ecm_node_id` array. This may allow one to redirect the code execution flow or introduce a denial of service. The fix has been included in USBX release [6.1.12](https://github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/releases/tag/v6.1.12_rel).

Prior to version 0.10.2, the heap initialization methods were missing a minimum size check for the given heap size argument. This could lead to out-of-bound writes when a heap was initialized with a size smaller than `3 * size_of::<usize>` because of metadata write operations. This vulnerability impacts all the initialization functions on the `Heap` and `LockedHeap` types, including `Heap::new`, `Heap::init`, `Heap::init_from_slice`, and `LockedHeap::new`. It also affects multiple uses of the `Heap::extend` method. Version 0.10.2 contains a patch for the issue. As a workaround, ensure that the heap is only initialized with a size larger than `3 * size_of::<usize>` and that the `Heap::extend` method is only called with sizes larger than `2 * size_of::<usize>()`. Also, ensure that the total heap size is (and stays) a multiple of `2 * size_of::<usize>()`.\n\n- CVE-2022-36938: DexLoader function get_stringidx_fromdex() in Redex prior to commit 3b44c64 can load an out of bound address when loading the string index table, potentially allowing remote code execution during processing of a 3rd party Android APK file.\n\n- CVE-2021-1058: NVIDIA vGPU software contains a vulnerability in the guest kernel mode driver and vGPU plugin, in which an input data size is not validated, which may lead to tampering of data or denial of service.

This crash affects the availability of the software and dependent downstream components.\n\n- CVE-2022-23580: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. During shape inference, TensorFlow can allocate a large vector based on a value from a tensor controlled by the user. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2022-29202: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, the implementation of `tf.ragged.constant` does not fully validate the input arguments. This results in a denial of service by consuming all available memory. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-36078: Binary provides encoding/decoding in Borsh and other formats. The vulnerability is a memory allocation vulnerability that can be exploited to allocate slices in memory with (arbitrary) excessive size value, which can either exhaust available memory or crash the whole program. When using `github.com/gagliardetto/binary` to parse unchecked (or wrong type of) data from untrusted sources of input (e.g. the blockchain) into slices, it's possible to allocate memory with excessive size. When `dec.Decode(&val)` method is used to parse data into a structure that is or contains slices of values, the length of the slice was previously read directly from the data itself without any checks on the size of it, and then a slice was allocated. This could lead to an overflow and an allocation of memory with excessive size value. Users should upgrade to `v0.7.1` or higher. A workaround is not to rely on the `dec.Decode(&val)` function to parse the data, but to use a custom `UnmarshalWithDecoder()` method that reads and checks the length of any slice.\n\n- CVE-2022-37311: OX App Suite through 7.10.6 has Uncontrolled Resource Consumption via a large location request parameter to the redirect servlet.\n\n- CVE-2022-37312: OX App Suite through 7.10.6 has Uncontrolled Resource Consumption via a large request body containing a redirect URL to the deferrer servlet.\n\n- CVE-2022-39294: conduit-hyper integrates a conduit application with the hyper server. Prior to version 0.4.2, `conduit-hyper` did not check any limit on a request's length before calling [`hyper::body::to_bytes`](https://docs.rs/hyper/latest/hyper/body/fn.to_bytes.html). An attacker could send a malicious request with an abnormally large `Content-Length`, which could lead to a panic if memory allocation failed for that request. In version 0.4.2, `conduit-hyper` sets an internal limit of 128 MiB per request, otherwise returning status 400 (\"Bad Request\"). This crate is part of the implementation of Rust's [crates.io](https://crates.io/), but that service is not affected due to its existing cloud infrastructure, which already drops such malicious requests. Even with the new limit in place, `conduit-hyper` is not recommended for production use, nor to directly serve the public Internet.\n\n- CVE-2022-4111: Unrestricted file size limit can lead to DoS in tooljet/tooljet <1.27 by allowing a logged in attacker to upload profile pictures over 2MB. \n\n- CVE-2022-41968: Nextcloud Server is an open source personal cloud server.

User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-10 Android-11 Android-12 Android-12L Android-13Android ID: A-242703556\n\n- CVE-2022-20691: A vulnerability in the Cisco Discovery Protocol functionality of Cisco ATA 190 Series Adaptive Telephone Adapter firmware could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a DoS condition of an affected device. This vulnerability is due to missing length validation of certain Cisco Discovery Protocol packet header fields. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted Cisco Discovery Protocol packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to exhaust available memory and cause the service to restart. Cisco has released firmware updates that address this vulnerability. \n\n- CVE-2022-21208: The package node-opcua before 2.74.0 are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) due to a missing limitation on the number of received chunks - per single session or in total for all concurrent sessions. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending an unlimited number of huge chunks (e.g. 2GB each) without sending the Final closing chunk.\n\n- CVE-2022-29212: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, certain TFLite models that were created using TFLite model converter would crash when loaded in the TFLite interpreter. The culprit is that during quantization the scale of values could be greater than 1 but code was always assuming sub-unit scaling. Thus, since code was calling `QuantizeMultiplierSmallerThanOneExp`, the `TFLITE_CHECK_LT` assertion would trigger and abort the process. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-29196: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.Conv3DBackpropFilterV2` does not fully validate the input arguments. This results in a `CHECK`-failure which can be used to trigger a denial of service attack. The code does not validate that the `filter_sizes` argument is a vector. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-29200: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.LSTMBlockCell` does not fully validate the input arguments. This results in a `CHECK`-failure which can be used to trigger a denial of service attack. The code does not validate the ranks of any of the arguments to this API call. This results in `CHECK`-failures when the elements of the tensor are accessed. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-20 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-20 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-789 (CanPrecede)",

They generally contain junk data with the contents of stack memory before the function was invoked. An attacker can sometimes control or read these contents. In other languages or conditions, a variable that is not explicitly initialized can be given a default value that has security implications, depending on the logic of the program. The presence of an uninitialized variable can sometimes indicate a typographic error in the code.\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2019-15900: Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).\n\n- CVE-2008-3688: Chain: A denial of service may be caused by an uninitialized variable (CWE-457) allowing an infinite loop (CWE-835) resulting from a connection to an unresponsive server.\n\n- CVE-2008-0081: Uninitialized variable leads to code execution in popular desktop application.\n\n- CVE-2007-4682: Crafted input triggers dereference of an uninitialized object pointer.\n\n- CVE-2007-3468: Crafted audio file triggers crash when an uninitialized variable is used.\n\n- CVE-2007-2728: Uninitialized random seed variable used.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-1619: A vulnerability in the authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) function of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass NETCONF or RESTCONF authentication and do either of the following: Install, manipulate, or delete the configuration of an affected device Cause memory corruption that results in a denial of service (DoS) on an affected device This vulnerability is due to an uninitialized variable. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of NETCONF or RESTCONF requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to use NETCONF or RESTCONF to install, manipulate, or delete the configuration of a network device or to corrupt memory on the device, resulting a DoS.\n\n- CVE-2021-41253: Zydis is an x86/x86-64 disassembler library. Users of Zydis versions v3.2.0 and older that use the string functions provided in `zycore` in order to append untrusted user data to the formatter buffer within their custom formatter hooks can run into heap buffer overflows. Older versions of Zydis failed to properly initialize the string object within the formatter buffer, forgetting to initialize a few fields, leaving their value to chance. This could then in turn cause zycore functions like `ZyanStringAppend` to make incorrect calculations for the new target size, resulting in heap memory corruption. This does not affect the regular uncustomized Zydis formatter, because Zydis internally doesn't use the string functions in zycore that act upon these fields. However, because the zycore string functions are the intended way to work with the formatter buffer for users of the library that wish to extend the formatter, we still consider this to be a vulnerability in Zydis. This bug is patched starting in version 3.2.1. As a workaround, users may refrain from using zycore string functions in their formatter hooks until updating to a patched version.\n\n- CVE-2021-21140: Uninitialized use in USB in Google Chrome prior to 88.0.4324.96 allowed a local attacker to potentially perform out of bounds memory access via via a USB device.\n\n- CVE-2021-44003: A vulnerability has been identified in JT2Go (All versions < V13.2.0.5), Teamcenter Visualization (All versions < V13.2.0.5). The Tiff_Loader.dll is vulnerable to use of uninitialized memory while parsing user supplied TIFF files. This could allow an attacker to cause a denial-of-service condition.\n\n- CVE-2022-31741: A crafted CMS message could have been processed incorrectly, leading to an invalid memory read, and potentially further memory corruption. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 91.10, Firefox < 101, and Firefox ESR < 91.10.\n\n- CVE-2021-35991: Adobe Bridge version 11.0.2 (and earlier) is affected by an Access of Uninitialized Pointer vulnerability when parsing a specially crafted file.

The implementation of `tf.io.decode_raw` produces incorrect results and crashes the Python interpreter when combining `fixed_length` and wider datatypes. The implementation of the padded version(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1d8903e5b167ed0432077a3db6e462daf781d1fe/tensorflow/core/kernels/decode_padded_raw_op.cc) is buggy due to a confusion about pointer arithmetic rules. First, the code computes(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1d8903e5b167ed0432077a3db6e462daf781d1fe/tensorflow/core/kernels/decode_padded_raw_op.cc#L61) the width of each output element by dividing the `fixed_length` value to the size of the type argument. The `fixed_length` argument is also used to determine the size needed for the output tensor(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1d8903e5b167ed0432077a3db6e462daf781d1fe/tensorflow/core/kernels/decode_padded_raw_op.cc#L63-L79). This is followed by reencoding code(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1d8903e5b167ed0432077a3db6e462daf781d1fe/tensorflow/core/kernels/decode_padded_raw_op.cc#L85-L94). The erroneous code is the last line above: it is moving the `out_data` pointer by `fixed_length * sizeof(T)` bytes whereas it only copied at most `fixed_length` bytes from the input. This results in parts of the input not being decoded into the output. Furthermore, because the pointer advance is far wider than desired, this quickly leads to writing to outside the bounds of the backing data. This OOB write leads to interpreter crash in the reproducer mentioned here, but more severe attacks can be mounted too, given that this gadget allows writing to periodically placed locations in memory. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2021-29947: Mozilla developers and community members reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 87.

This could cause the product to read from or write to unexpected memory locations, leading to a denial of service. If the uninitialized pointer is used as a function call, then arbitrary functions could be invoked. If an attacker can influence the portion of uninitialized memory that is contained in the pointer, this weakness could be leveraged to execute code or perform other attacks.\n\n\nDepending on memory layout, associated memory management behaviors, and product operation, the attacker might be able to influence the contents of the uninitialized pointer, thus gaining more fine-grained control of the memory location to be accessed.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nCanPrecede -> CWE-125\nCanPrecede -> CWE-787\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** There are close relationships between incorrect pointer dereferences and other weaknesses related to buffer operations. There may not be sufficient community agreement regarding these relationships. Further study is needed to determine when these relationships are chains, composites, perspective/layering, or other types of relationships. As of September 2010, most of the relationships are being captured as chains.\n\n**[Terminology]** Many weaknesses related to pointer dereferences fall under the general term of \"memory corruption\" or \"memory safety.\" As of September 2010, there is no commonly-used terminology that covers the lower-level variants.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2024-32878:** LLM product has a free of an uninitialized pointer\n- **CVE-2010-0211:** chain: unchecked return value (CWE-252) leads to free of invalid, uninitialized pointer (CWE-824).\n- **CVE-2009-2768:** Pointer in structure is not initialized, leading to NULL pointer dereference (CWE-476) and system crash.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-252: Unchecked Return Value\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not check the return value from a method or function, which can prevent it from detecting unexpected states and conditions.\n\n### Extended Description\nTwo common programmer assumptions are \"this function call can never fail\" and \"it doesn't matter if this function call fails\". If an attacker can force the function to fail or otherwise return a value that is not expected, then the subsequent program logic could lead to a vulnerability, because the product is not in a state that the programmer assumes. For example, if the program calls a function to drop privileges but does not check the return code to ensure that privileges were successfully dropped, then the program will continue to operate with the higher privileges.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-754\nChildOf -> CWE-754\nCanPrecede -> CWE-476\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2020-17533:** Chain: unchecked return value (CWE-252) of some functions for policy enforcement leads to authorization bypass (CWE-862)\n- **CVE-2020-6078:** Chain: The return value of a function returning a pointer is not checked for success (CWE-252) resulting in the later use of an uninitialized variable (CWE-456) and a null pointer dereference (CWE-476)\n- **CVE-2019-15900:** Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-823: Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product performs pointer arithmetic on a valid pointer, but it uses an offset that can point outside of the intended range of valid memory locations for the resulting pointer.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nWhile a pointer can contain a reference to any arbitrary memory location, a program typically only intends to use the pointer to access limited portions of memory, such as contiguous memory used to access an individual array.\n\n\nPrograms may use offsets in order to access fields or sub-elements stored within structured data. The offset might be out-of-range if it comes from an untrusted source, is the result of an incorrect calculation, or occurs because of another error.\n\n\nIf an attacker can control or influence the offset so that it points outside of the intended boundaries of the structure, then the attacker may be able to read or write to memory locations that are used elsewhere in the product. As a result, the attack might change the state of the product as accessed through program variables, cause a crash or instable behavior, and possibly lead to code execution.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nUntrusted pointer offset: This term is narrower than the concept of \"out-of-range\" offset, since the offset might be the result of a calculation or other error that does not depend on any externally-supplied values.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nCanPrecede -> CWE-125\nCanPrecede -> CWE-787\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

If the pointer is dereferenced for a write operation, the attack might allow modification of critical state variables, cause a crash, or execute code. If the dereferencing operation is for a read, then the attack might allow reading of sensitive data, cause a crash, or set a variable to an unexpected value (since the value will be read from an unexpected memory location).\n\n\nThere are several variants of this weakness, including but not necessarily limited to:\n\n\n  - The untrusted value is directly invoked as a function call.\n\n  - In OS kernels or drivers where there is a boundary between \"userland\" and privileged memory spaces, an untrusted pointer might enter through an API or system call (see CWE-781 for one such example).\n\n  - Inadvertently accepting the value from an untrusted control sphere when it did not have to be accepted as input at all. This might occur when the code was originally developed to be run by a single user in a non-networked environment, and the code is then ported to or otherwise exposed to a networked environment.\n\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nCanPrecede -> CWE-125\nCanPrecede -> CWE-787\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

The \"handle\" in the untrusted area is replaced in one function, but not another - thus also, effectively, exposure to wrong sphere (CWE-668).\n- **CVE-2009-1719:** Untrusted dereference using undocumented constructor.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-1285: Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product receives input that is expected to specify an index, position, or offset into an indexable resource such as a buffer or file, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the specified index/position/offset has the required properties.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nOften, indexable resources such as memory buffers or files can be accessed using a specific position, index, or offset, such as an index for an array or a position for a file. When untrusted input is not properly validated before it is used as an index, attackers could access (or attempt to access) unauthorized portions of these resources. This could be used to cause buffer overflows, excessive resource allocation, or trigger unexpected failures. \n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-20\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This weakness can precede uncontrolled memory allocation (CWE-789) in languages that automatically expand an array when an index is used that is larger than the size of the array, such as JavaScript.\n\n**[Theoretical]** An improperly validated array index might lead directly to the always-incorrect behavior of \"access of array using out-of-bounds index.\"\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2005-0369:** large ID in packet used as array index\n- **CVE-2001-1009:** negative array index as argument to POP LIST command\n- **CVE-2003-0721:** Integer signedness error leads to negative array index\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-690: Unchecked Return Value to NULL Pointer Dereference\n**Abstraction:** Compound\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not check for an error after calling a function that can return with a NULL pointer if the function fails, which leads to a resultant NULL pointer dereference.\n\n### Extended Description\nWhile unchecked return value weaknesses are not limited to returns of NULL pointers (see the examples in CWE-252), functions often return NULL to indicate an error status. When this error condition is not checked, a NULL pointer dereference can occur.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nStartsWith -> CWE-252\nChildOf -> CWE-252\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a named chain, which combines multiple weaknesses.\n**Comments:** Mapping to each separate weakness in the chain would be more precise.\n**Reasons:**\n- Other\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2008-1052:** Large Content-Length value leads to NULL pointer dereference when malloc fails.\n- **CVE-2006-6227:** Large message length field leads to NULL pointer dereference when malloc fails.\n- **CVE-2006-2555:** Parsing routine encounters NULL dereference when input is missing a colon separator.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-617: Reachable Assertion\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product contains an assert() or similar statement that can be triggered by an attacker, which leads to an application exit or other behavior that is more severe than necessary.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nWhile assertion is good for catching logic errors and reducing the chances of reaching more serious vulnerability conditions, it can still lead to a denial of service.\n\n\nFor example, if a server handles multiple simultaneous connections, and an assert() occurs in one single connection that causes all other connections to be dropped, this is a reachable assertion that leads to a denial of service.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nassertion failure\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-670\nChildOf -> CWE-670\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

However it fails to correctly handle any errors that may occur while parsing the issuer field (which might occur if the issuer field is maliciously constructed). This may subsequently result in a NULL pointer deref and a crash leading to a potential denial of service attack. The function X509_issuer_and_serial_hash() is never directly called by OpenSSL itself so applications are only vulnerable if they use this function directly and they use it on certificates that may have been obtained from untrusted sources. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1i and below are affected by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1j. OpenSSL versions 1.0.2x and below are affected by this issue. However OpenSSL 1.0.2 is out of support and no longer receiving public updates. Premium support customers of OpenSSL 1.0.2 should upgrade to 1.0.2y. Other users should upgrade to 1.1.1j. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1j (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1i). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2y (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2x).\n\n- CVE-2021-25458: NULL pointer dereference vulnerability in ION driver prior to SMR Sep-2021 Release 1 allows attackers to cause memory corruption.\n\n- CVE-2021-25462: NULL pointer dereference vulnerability in NPU driver prior to SMR Sep-2021 Release 1 allows attackers to cause memory corruption.\n\n- CVE-2021-25491: A vulnerability in mfc driver prior to SMR Oct-2021 Release 1 allows memory corruption via NULL-pointer dereference.\n\n- CVE-2021-32282: An issue was discovered in gravity through 0.8.1. A NULL pointer dereference exists in the function ircode_add_check() located in gravity_ircode.c. It allows an attacker to cause Denial of Service.\n\n- CVE-2021-37639: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. When restoring tensors via raw APIs, if the tensor name is not provided, TensorFlow can be tricked into dereferencing a null pointer. Alternatively, attackers can read memory outside the bounds of heap allocated data by providing some tensor names but not enough for a successful restoration. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/47a06f40411a69c99f381495f490536972152ac0/tensorflow/core/kernels/save_restore_tensor.cc#L158-L159) retrieves the tensor list corresponding to the `tensor_name` user controlled input and immediately retrieves the tensor at the restoration index (controlled via `preferred_shard` argument). This occurs without validating that the provided list has enough values. If the list is empty this results in dereferencing a null pointer (undefined behavior). If, however, the list has some elements, if the restoration index is outside the bounds this results in heap OOB read. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 9e82dce6e6bd1f36a57e08fa85af213e2b2f2622. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2021-3119: Zetetic SQLCipher 4.x before 4.4.3 has a NULL pointer dereferencing issue related to sqlcipher_export in crypto.c and sqlite3StrICmp in sqlite3.c. This may allow an attacker to perform a remote denial of service attack. For example, an SQL injection can be used to execute the crafted SQL command sequence, which causes a segmentation fault.\n\n- CVE-2020-11273: Histogram type KPI was teardown with the assumption of the existence of histogram binning info and will lead to null pointer access when histogram binning info is missing due to lack of null check in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Mobile\n\n- CVE-2021-1274: Multiple vulnerabilities in Cisco SD-WAN products could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute denial of service (DoS) attacks against an affected device. For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2021-27077: Windows Win32k Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-3319: DOS: Incorrect 802154 Frame Validation for Omitted Source / Dest Addresses.

This could cause the product to read from or write to unexpected memory locations, leading to a denial of service. If the uninitialized pointer is used as a function call, then arbitrary functions could be invoked. If an attacker can influence the portion of uninitialized memory that is contained in the pointer, this weakness could be leveraged to execute code or perform other attacks.\n\n\nDepending on memory layout, associated memory management behaviors, and product operation, the attacker might be able to influence the contents of the uninitialized pointer, thus gaining more fine-grained control of the memory location to be accessed.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2024-32878: LLM product has a free of an uninitialized pointer\n\n- CVE-2010-0211: chain: unchecked return value (CWE-252) leads to free of invalid, uninitialized pointer (CWE-824).\n\n- CVE-2009-2768: Pointer in structure is not initialized, leading to NULL pointer dereference (CWE-476) and system crash.\n\n- CVE-2009-1721: Free of an uninitialized pointer.\n\n- CVE-2009-1415: Improper handling of invalid signatures leads to free of invalid pointer.\n\n- CVE-2009-0846: Invalid encoding triggers free of uninitialized pointer.\n\n- CVE-2009-0040: Crafted PNG image leads to free of uninitialized pointer.\n\n- CVE-2008-2934: Crafted GIF image leads to free of uninitialized pointer.\n\n- CVE-2007-4682: Access of uninitialized pointer might lead to code execution.\n\n- CVE-2007-4639: Step-based manipulation: invocation of debugging function before the primary initialization function leads to access of an uninitialized pointer and code execution.\n\n- CVE-2007-4000: Unchecked return values can lead to a write to an uninitialized pointer.\n\n- CVE-2007-2442: zero-length input leads to free of uninitialized pointer.\n\n- CVE-2007-1213: Crafted font leads to uninitialized function pointer.\n\n- CVE-2006-6143: Uninitialized function pointer in freed memory is invoked\n\n- CVE-2006-4175: LDAP server mishandles malformed BER queries, leading to free of uninitialized memory\n\n- CVE-2006-0054: Firewall can crash with certain ICMP packets that trigger access of an uninitialized pointer.\n\n- CVE-2003-1201: LDAP server does not initialize members of structs, which leads to free of uninitialized pointer if an LDAP request fails.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-3593: An invalid pointer initialization issue was found in the SLiRP networking implementation of QEMU.

As a result, the attack might change the state of the product as accessed through program variables, cause a crash or instable behavior, and possibly lead to code execution.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2010-2160: Invalid offset in undocumented opcode leads to memory corruption.\n\n- CVE-2010-1281: Multimedia player uses untrusted value from a file when using file-pointer calculations.\n\n- CVE-2009-3129: Spreadsheet program processes a record with an invalid size field, which is later used as an offset.\n\n- CVE-2009-2694: Instant messaging library does not validate an offset value specified in a packet.\n\n- CVE-2009-2687: Language interpreter does not properly handle invalid offsets in JPEG image, leading to out-of-bounds memory access and crash.\n\n- CVE-2009-0690: negative offset leads to out-of-bounds read\n\n- CVE-2008-4114: untrusted offset in kernel\n\n- CVE-2010-2873: \"blind trust\" of an offset value while writing heap memory allows corruption of function pointer,leading to code execution\n\n- CVE-2010-2866: negative value (signed) causes pointer miscalculation\n\n- CVE-2010-2872: signed values cause incorrect pointer calculation\n\n- CVE-2007-5657: values used as pointer offsets\n\n- CVE-2010-2867: a return value from a function is sign-extended if the value is signed, then used as an offset for pointer arithmetic\n\n- CVE-2009-1097: portions of a GIF image used as offsets, causing corruption of an object pointer.\n\n- CVE-2008-1807: invalid numeric field leads to a free of arbitrary memory locations, then code execution.\n\n- CVE-2007-2500: large number of elements leads to a free of an arbitrary address\n\n- CVE-2008-1686: array index issue (CWE-129) with negative offset, used to dereference a function pointer\n\n- CVE-2010-2878: \"buffer seek\" value - basically an offset?\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-34595: A crafted request with invalid offsets may cause an out-of-bounds read or write access in CODESYS V2 Runtime Toolkit 32 Bit full and PLCWinNT prior to versions V2.4.7.56, resulting in a denial-of-service condition or local memory overwrite.\n\n- CVE-2021-3888: libmobi is vulnerable to Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset\n\n- CVE-2021-3889: libmobi is vulnerable to Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset\n\n- CVE-2021-22549: An attacker can modify the address to point to trusted memory to overwrite arbitrary trusted memory.

If the pointer is dereferenced for a write operation, the attack might allow modification of critical state variables, cause a crash, or execute code. If the dereferencing operation is for a read, then the attack might allow reading of sensitive data, cause a crash, or set a variable to an unexpected value (since the value will be read from an unexpected memory location).\n\n\nThere are several variants of this weakness, including but not necessarily limited to:\n\n\n  - The untrusted value is directly invoked as a function call.\n\n  - In OS kernels or drivers where there is a boundary between \"userland\" and privileged memory spaces, an untrusted pointer might enter through an API or system call (see CWE-781 for one such example).\n\n  - Inadvertently accepting the value from an untrusted control sphere when it did not have to be accepted as input at all. This might occur when the code was originally developed to be run by a single user in a non-networked environment, and the code is then ported to or otherwise exposed to a networked environment.\n\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2007-5655: message-passing framework interprets values in packets as pointers, causing a crash.\n\n- CVE-2010-2299: labeled as a \"type confusion\" issue, also referred to as a \"stale pointer.\" However, the bug ID says \"contents are simply interpreted as a pointer... renderer ordinarily doesn't supply this pointer directly\". The \"handle\" in the untrusted area is replaced in one function, but not another - thus also, effectively, exposure to wrong sphere (CWE-668).\n\n- CVE-2009-1719: Untrusted dereference using undocumented constructor.\n\n- CVE-2009-1250: An error code is incorrectly checked and interpreted as a pointer, leading to a crash.\n\n- CVE-2009-0311: An untrusted value is obtained from a packet and directly called as a function pointer, leading to code execution.\n\n- CVE-2010-1818: Undocumented attribute in multimedia software allows \"unmarshaling\" of an untrusted pointer.\n\n- CVE-2010-3189: ActiveX control for security software accepts a parameter that is assumed to be an initialized pointer.\n\n- CVE-2010-1253: Spreadsheet software treats certain record values that lead to \"user-controlled pointer\" (might be untrusted offset, not untrusted pointer).\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-22649: Luxion KeyShot versions prior to 10.1, Luxion KeyShot Viewer versions prior to 10.1, Luxion KeyShot Network Rendering versions prior to 10.1, and Luxion KeyVR versions prior to 10.1 have multiple NULL pointer dereference issues while processing project files, which may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.\n\n- CVE-2021-40157: A user may be tricked into opening a malicious FBX file which may exploit an Untrusted Pointer Dereference vulnerability in FBX\u2019s Review version 1.5.0 and prior causing it to run arbitrary code on the system.\n\n- CVE-2021-1973: A FTM Diag command can allow an arbitrary write into modem OS space in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon IoT, Snapdragon Mobile, Snapdragon Voice & Music, Snapdragon Wearables\n\n- CVE-2021-20239: A flaw was found in the Linux kernel in versions before 5.4.92 in the BPF protocol.

The vulnerability is due to a logic error in how the software cryptography module handles specific types of decryption errors. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious packets over an established IPsec connection. A successful exploit could cause the device to crash, forcing it to reload. Important: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability would not cause a compromise of any encrypted data. Note: This vulnerability affects only Cisco ASA Software Release 9.16.1 and Cisco FTD Software Release 7.0.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-28090: Tor before 0.4.5.7 allows a remote attacker to cause Tor directory authorities to exit with an assertion failure, aka TROVE-2021-002.\n\n- CVE-2021-28543: Varnish varnish-modules before 0.17.1 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon restart) in some configurations. This does not affect organizations that only install the Varnish Cache product; however, it is common to install both Varnish Cache and varnish-modules. Specifically, an assertion failure or NULL pointer dereference can be triggered in Varnish Cache through the varnish-modules header.append() and header.copy() functions. For some Varnish Configuration Language (VCL) files, this gives remote clients an opportunity to cause a Varnish Cache restart. A restart reduces overall availability and performance due to an increased number of cache misses, and may cause higher load on backend servers.\n\n- CVE-2020-36382: OpenVPN Access Server 2.7.3 to 2.8.7 allows remote attackers to trigger an assert during the user authentication phase via incorrect authentication token data in an early phase of the user authentication resulting in a denial of service.\n\n- CVE-2020-1681: Receipt of a specifically malformed NDP packet sent from the local area network (LAN) to a device running Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved can cause the ndp process to crash, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). The process automatically restarts without intervention, but a continuous receipt of the malformed NDP packets could leaded to an extended Denial of Service condition. During this time, IPv6 neighbor learning will be affected. The issue occurs when parsing the incoming malformed NDP packet. Rather than simply discarding the packet, the process asserts, performing a controlled exit and restart, thereby avoiding any chance of an unhandled exception. Exploitation of this vulnerability is limited to a temporary denial of service, and cannot be leveraged to cause additional impact on the system. This issue is limited to the processing of IPv6 NDP packets. IPv4 packet processing cannot trigger, and is unaffected by this vulnerability. This issue affects all Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved versions prior to 20.1R2-EVO. Junos OS is unaffected by this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2021-30501: An assertion abort was found in upx MemBuffer::alloc() in mem.cpp, in version UPX 4.0.0. The flow allows attackers to cause a denial of service (abort) via a crafted file.\n\n- CVE-2022-31620: In libjpeg before 1.64, BitStream<false>::Get in bitstream.hpp has an assertion failure that may cause denial of service. This is related to out-of-bounds array access during arithmetically coded lossless scan or arithmetically coded sequential scan.\n\n- CVE-2022-31100: rulex is a new, portable, regular expression language. When parsing untrusted rulex expressions, rulex may crash, possibly enabling a Denial of Service attack. This happens when the expression contains a multi-byte UTF-8 code point in a string literal or after a backslash, because rulex tries to slice into the code point and panics as a result. This is a security concern for you, if your service parses untrusted rulex expressions (expressions provided by an untrusted user), and your service becomes unavailable when the thread running rulex panics. The crashes are fixed in version **0.4.3**. Affected users are advised to update to this version. The only known workaround for this issue is to assume that regular expression parsing will panic and to add logic to catch panics.\n\n- CVE-2022-3488: Processing of repeated responses to the same query, where both responses contain ECS pseudo-options, but where the first is broken in some way, can cause BIND to exit with an assertion failure. 'Broken' in this context is anything that would cause the resolver to reject the query response, such as a mismatch between query and answer name. This issue affects BIND 9 versions 9.11.4-S1 through 9.11.37-S1 and 9.16.8-S1 through 9.16.36-S1.\n\n- CVE-2022-36004: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. When `tf.random.gamma` receives large input shape and rates, it gives a `CHECK` fail that can trigger a denial of service attack. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 552bfced6ce4809db5f3ca305f60ff80dd40c5a3. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.10.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.9.1, TensorFlow 2.8.1, and TensorFlow 2.7.2, as these are also affected and still in supported range. There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-48363: In MPD before 0.23.8, as used on Automotive Grade Linux and other platforms, the PipeWire output plugin mishandles a Drain call in certain situations involving truncated files. Eventually there is an assertion failure in libmpdclient because libqtappfw passes in a NULL pointer.\n\n- CVE-2022-23572: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. Under certain scenarios, TensorFlow can fail to specialize a type during shape inference. This case is covered by the `DCHECK` function however, `DCHECK` is a no-op in production builds and an assertion failure in debug builds. In the first case execution proceeds to the `ValueOrDie` line. This results in an assertion failure as `ret` contains an error `Status`, not a value. In the second case we also get a crash due to the assertion failure. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0.

The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/f24faa153ad31a4b51578f8181d3aaab77a1ddeb/tensorflow/core/kernels/boosted_trees/resource_ops.cc#L55) uses a reference counted resource and decrements the refcount if the initialization fails, as it should. However, when the code was written, the resource was represented as a naked pointer but later refactoring has changed it to be a smart pointer. Thus, when the pointer leaves the scope, a subsequent `free`-ing of the resource occurs, but this fails to take into account that the refcount has already reached 0, thus the resource has been already freed. During this double-free process, members of the resource object are accessed for cleanup but they are invalid as the entire resource has been freed. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 5ecec9c6fbdbc6be03295685190a45e7eee726ab. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0.

Code may rely on specified quantities to allocate resources, perform calculations, control iteration, etc. When the quantity is not properly validated, then attackers can specify malicious quantities to cause excessive resource allocation, trigger unexpected failures, enable buffer overflows, etc.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-21668: Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).\n\n- CVE-2008-1440: lack of validation of length field leads to infinite loop\n\n- CVE-2008-2374: lack of validation of string length fields allows memory consumption or buffer over-read\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-31401: An issue was discovered in tcp_rcv() in nptcp.c in HCC embedded InterNiche 4.0.1. The TCP header processing code doesn't sanitize the value of the IP total length field (header length + data length). With a crafted IP packet, an integer overflow occurs whenever the value of the IP data length is calculated by subtracting the length of the header from the total length of the IP packet.\n\n- CVE-2021-31802: NETGEAR R7000 1.0.11.116 devices have a heap-based Buffer Overflow that is exploitable from the local network without authentication. The vulnerability exists within the handling of an HTTP request. An attacker can leverage this to execute code as root. The problem is that a user-provided length value is trusted during a backup.cgi file upload. The attacker must add a \\\\n before the Content-Length header.\n\n- CVE-2021-37663: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions due to incomplete validation in `tf.raw_ops.QuantizeV2`, an attacker can trigger undefined behavior via binding a reference to a null pointer or can access data outside the bounds of heap allocated arrays. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/84d053187cb80d975ef2b9684d4b61981bca0c41/tensorflow/core/kernels/quantize_op.cc#L59) has some validation but does not check that `min_range` and `max_range` both have the same non-zero number of elements. If `axis` is provided (i.e., not `-1`), then validation should check that it is a value in range for the rank of `input` tensor and then the lengths of `min_range` and `max_range` inputs match the `axis` dimension of the `input` tensor. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 6da6620efad397c85493b8f8667b821403516708. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2021-37665: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions due to incomplete validation in MKL implementation of requantization, an attacker can trigger undefined behavior via binding a reference to a null pointer or can access data outside the bounds of heap allocated arrays. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/460e000de3a83278fb00b61a16d161b1964f15f4/tensorflow/core/kernels/mkl/mkl_requantization_range_per_channel_op.cc) does not validate the dimensions of the `input` tensor. A similar issue occurs in `MklRequantizePerChannelOp`. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/460e000de3a83278fb00b61a16d161b1964f15f4/tensorflow/core/kernels/mkl/mkl_requantize_per_channel_op.cc) does not perform full validation for all the input arguments. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 9e62869465573cb2d9b5053f1fa02a81fce21d69 and in the Github commit 203214568f5bc237603dbab6e1fd389f1572f5c9. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0.

Modules for TCP syslog reception have a potential heap buffer overflow when octet-counted framing is used. This can result in a segfault or some other malfunction. As of our understanding, this vulnerability can not be used for remote code execution. But there may still be a slight chance for experts to do that. The bug occurs when the octet count is read. While there is a check for the maximum number of octets, digits are written to a heap buffer even when the octet count is over the maximum, This can be used to overrun the memory buffer. However, once the sequence of digits stop, no additional characters can be added to the buffer. In our opinion, this makes remote exploits impossible or at least highly complex. Octet-counted framing is one of two potential framing modes. It is relatively uncommon, but enabled by default on receivers. Modules `imtcp`, `imptcp`, `imgssapi`, and `imhttp` are used for regular syslog message reception. It is best practice not to directly expose them to the public. When this practice is followed, the risk is considerably lower. Module `imdiag` is a diagnostics module primarily intended for testbench runs. We do not expect it to be present on any production installation. Octet-counted framing is not very common. Usually, it needs to be specifically enabled at senders. If users do not need it, they can turn it off for the most important modules. This will mitigate the vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2022-25727: Memory Corruption in modem due to improper length check while copying into memory in Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Voice & Music\n\n- CVE-2022-25793: A Stack-based Buffer Overflow Vulnerability in Autodesk 3ds Max 2022, 2021, and 2020 may lead to code execution through the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer when parsing ActionScript Byte Code files.

Azure RTOS USBX implementation of host support for USB CDC ECM includes an integer underflow and a buffer overflow in the `_ux_host_class_cdc_ecm_mac_address_get` function which may be potentially exploited to achieve remote code execution or denial of service. Setting mac address string descriptor length to a `0` or `1` allows an attacker to introduce an integer underflow followed (string_length) by a buffer overflow of the `cdc_ecm -> ux_host_class_cdc_ecm_node_id` array. This may allow one to redirect the code execution flow or introduce a denial of service. The fix has been included in USBX release [6.1.12](https://github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/releases/tag/v6.1.12_rel). Improved mac address string descriptor length validation to check for unexpectedly small values may be used as a workaround.\n\n- CVE-2022-36620: D-link DIR-816 A2_v1.10CNB04, DIR-878 DIR_878_FW1.30B08.img is vulnerable to Buffer Overflow via /goform/addRouting.\n\n- CVE-2022-37134: D-link DIR-816 A2_v1.10CNB04.img is vulnerable to Buffer Overflow via /goform/form2Wan.cgi.

Prior to version 0.10.2, the heap initialization methods were missing a minimum size check for the given heap size argument. This could lead to out-of-bound writes when a heap was initialized with a size smaller than `3 * size_of::<usize>` because of metadata write operations. This vulnerability impacts all the initialization functions on the `Heap` and `LockedHeap` types, including `Heap::new`, `Heap::init`, `Heap::init_from_slice`, and `LockedHeap::new`. It also affects multiple uses of the `Heap::extend` method. Version 0.10.2 contains a patch for the issue. As a workaround, ensure that the heap is only initialized with a size larger than `3 * size_of::<usize>` and that the `Heap::extend` method is only called with sizes larger than `2 * size_of::<usize>()`. Also, ensure that the total heap size is (and stays) a multiple of `2 * size_of::<usize>()`.\n\n- CVE-2022-36938: DexLoader function get_stringidx_fromdex() in Redex prior to commit 3b44c64 can load an out of bound address when loading the string index table, potentially allowing remote code execution during processing of a 3rd party Android APK file.\n\n- CVE-2021-1058: NVIDIA vGPU software contains a vulnerability in the guest kernel mode driver and vGPU plugin, in which an input data size is not validated, which may lead to tampering of data or denial of service.

In affected versions an attacker can trigger a denial of service via a segmentation fault in `tf.raw_ops.MaxPoolGrad` caused by missing validation. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/460e000de3a83278fb00b61a16d161b1964f15f4/tensorflow/core/kernels/maxpooling_op.cc) misses some validation for the `orig_input` and `orig_output` tensors. The fixes for CVE-2021-29579 were incomplete. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 136b51f10903e044308cf77117c0ed9871350475. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2021-37677: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions the shape inference code for `tf.raw_ops.Dequantize` has a vulnerability that could trigger a denial of service via a segfault if an attacker provides invalid arguments. The shape inference [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/460e000de3a83278fb00b61a16d161b1964f15f4/tensorflow/core/ops/array_ops.cc#L2999-L3014) uses `axis` to select between two different values for `minmax_rank` which is then used to retrieve tensor dimensions. However, code assumes that `axis` can be either `-1` or a value greater than `-1`, with no validation for the other values. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit da857cfa0fde8f79ad0afdbc94e88b5d4bbec764. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2021-39193: Frontier is Substrate's Ethereum compatibility layer. Prior to commit number 0b962f218f0cdd796dadfe26c3f09e68f7861b26, a bug in `pallet-ethereum` can cause invalid transactions to be included in the Ethereum block state in `pallet-ethereum` due to not validating the input data size. Any invalid transactions included this way have no possibility to alter the internal Ethereum or Substrate state. The transaction will appear to have be included, but is of no effect as it is rejected by the EVM engine. The impact is further limited by Substrate extrinsic size constraints.

We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2022-29202: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, the implementation of `tf.ragged.constant` does not fully validate the input arguments. This results in a denial of service by consuming all available memory. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-36078: Binary provides encoding/decoding in Borsh and other formats. The vulnerability is a memory allocation vulnerability that can be exploited to allocate slices in memory with (arbitrary) excessive size value, which can either exhaust available memory or crash the whole program. When using `github.com/gagliardetto/binary` to parse unchecked (or wrong type of) data from untrusted sources of input (e.g. the blockchain) into slices, it's possible to allocate memory with excessive size. When `dec.Decode(&val)` method is used to parse data into a structure that is or contains slices of values, the length of the slice was previously read directly from the data itself without any checks on the size of it, and then a slice was allocated. This could lead to an overflow and an allocation of memory with excessive size value. Users should upgrade to `v0.7.1` or higher. A workaround is not to rely on the `dec.Decode(&val)` function to parse the data, but to use a custom `UnmarshalWithDecoder()` method that reads and checks the length of any slice.\n\n- CVE-2022-37311: OX App Suite through 7.10.6 has Uncontrolled Resource Consumption via a large location request parameter to the redirect servlet.\n\n- CVE-2022-37312: OX App Suite through 7.10.6 has Uncontrolled Resource Consumption via a large request body containing a redirect URL to the deferrer servlet.\n\n- CVE-2022-39294: conduit-hyper integrates a conduit application with the hyper server. Prior to version 0.4.2, `conduit-hyper` did not check any limit on a request's length before calling [`hyper::body::to_bytes`](https://docs.rs/hyper/latest/hyper/body/fn.to_bytes.html). An attacker could send a malicious request with an abnormally large `Content-Length`, which could lead to a panic if memory allocation failed for that request. In version 0.4.2, `conduit-hyper` sets an internal limit of 128 MiB per request, otherwise returning status 400 (\"Bad Request\"). This crate is part of the implementation of Rust's [crates.io](https://crates.io/), but that service is not affected due to its existing cloud infrastructure, which already drops such malicious requests. Even with the new limit in place, `conduit-hyper` is not recommended for production use, nor to directly serve the public Internet.\n\n- CVE-2022-4111: Unrestricted file size limit can lead to DoS in tooljet/tooljet <1.27 by allowing a logged in attacker to upload profile pictures over 2MB. \n\n- CVE-2022-41968: Nextcloud Server is an open source personal cloud server.

This vulnerability is due to missing length validation of certain Cisco Discovery Protocol packet header fields. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted Cisco Discovery Protocol packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to exhaust available memory and cause the service to restart. Cisco has released firmware updates that address this vulnerability. \n\n- CVE-2022-21208: The package node-opcua before 2.74.0 are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) due to a missing limitation on the number of received chunks - per single session or in total for all concurrent sessions. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending an unlimited number of huge chunks (e.g. 2GB each) without sending the Final closing chunk.\n\n- CVE-2022-29212: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, certain TFLite models that were created using TFLite model converter would crash when loaded in the TFLite interpreter. The culprit is that during quantization the scale of values could be greater than 1 but code was always assuming sub-unit scaling. Thus, since code was calling `QuantizeMultiplierSmallerThanOneExp`, the `TFLITE_CHECK_LT` assertion would trigger and abort the process. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-29196: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.Conv3DBackpropFilterV2` does not fully validate the input arguments. This results in a `CHECK`-failure which can be used to trigger a denial of service attack. The code does not validate that the `filter_sizes` argument is a vector. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-29200: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.LSTMBlockCell` does not fully validate the input arguments. This results in a `CHECK`-failure which can be used to trigger a denial of service attack. The code does not validate the ranks of any of the arguments to this API call. This results in `CHECK`-failures when the elements of the tensor are accessed. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-20 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-20 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-789 (CanPrecede)",

They generally contain junk data with the contents of stack memory before the function was invoked. An attacker can sometimes control or read these contents. In other languages or conditions, a variable that is not explicitly initialized can be given a default value that has security implications, depending on the logic of the program. The presence of an uninitialized variable can sometimes indicate a typographic error in the code.\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2019-15900: Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).\n\n- CVE-2008-3688: Chain: A denial of service may be caused by an uninitialized variable (CWE-457) allowing an infinite loop (CWE-835) resulting from a connection to an unresponsive server.\n\n- CVE-2008-0081: Uninitialized variable leads to code execution in popular desktop application.\n\n- CVE-2007-4682: Crafted input triggers dereference of an uninitialized object pointer.\n\n- CVE-2007-3468: Crafted audio file triggers crash when an uninitialized variable is used.\n\n- CVE-2007-2728: Uninitialized random seed variable used.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-1619: A vulnerability in the authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) function of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass NETCONF or RESTCONF authentication and do either of the following: Install, manipulate, or delete the configuration of an affected device Cause memory corruption that results in a denial of service (DoS) on an affected device This vulnerability is due to an uninitialized variable. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of NETCONF or RESTCONF requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to use NETCONF or RESTCONF to install, manipulate, or delete the configuration of a network device or to corrupt memory on the device, resulting a DoS.\n\n- CVE-2021-41253: Zydis is an x86/x86-64 disassembler library. Users of Zydis versions v3.2.0 and older that use the string functions provided in `zycore` in order to append untrusted user data to the formatter buffer within their custom formatter hooks can run into heap buffer overflows. Older versions of Zydis failed to properly initialize the string object within the formatter buffer, forgetting to initialize a few fields, leaving their value to chance. This could then in turn cause zycore functions like `ZyanStringAppend` to make incorrect calculations for the new target size, resulting in heap memory corruption. This does not affect the regular uncustomized Zydis formatter, because Zydis internally doesn't use the string functions in zycore that act upon these fields. However, because the zycore string functions are the intended way to work with the formatter buffer for users of the library that wish to extend the formatter, we still consider this to be a vulnerability in Zydis. This bug is patched starting in version 3.2.1. As a workaround, users may refrain from using zycore string functions in their formatter hooks until updating to a patched version.\n\n- CVE-2021-21140: Uninitialized use in USB in Google Chrome prior to 88.0.4324.96 allowed a local attacker to potentially perform out of bounds memory access via via a USB device.\n\n- CVE-2021-44003: A vulnerability has been identified in JT2Go (All versions < V13.2.0.5), Teamcenter Visualization (All versions < V13.2.0.5).

The implementation of `tf.io.decode_raw` produces incorrect results and crashes the Python interpreter when combining `fixed_length` and wider datatypes. The implementation of the padded version(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1d8903e5b167ed0432077a3db6e462daf781d1fe/tensorflow/core/kernels/decode_padded_raw_op.cc) is buggy due to a confusion about pointer arithmetic rules. First, the code computes(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1d8903e5b167ed0432077a3db6e462daf781d1fe/tensorflow/core/kernels/decode_padded_raw_op.cc#L61) the width of each output element by dividing the `fixed_length` value to the size of the type argument. The `fixed_length` argument is also used to determine the size needed for the output tensor(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1d8903e5b167ed0432077a3db6e462daf781d1fe/tensorflow/core/kernels/decode_padded_raw_op.cc#L63-L79). This is followed by reencoding code(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1d8903e5b167ed0432077a3db6e462daf781d1fe/tensorflow/core/kernels/decode_padded_raw_op.cc#L85-L94). The erroneous code is the last line above: it is moving the `out_data` pointer by `fixed_length * sizeof(T)` bytes whereas it only copied at most `fixed_length` bytes from the input. This results in parts of the input not being decoded into the output. Furthermore, because the pointer advance is far wider than desired, this quickly leads to writing to outside the bounds of the backing data. This OOB write leads to interpreter crash in the reproducer mentioned here, but more severe attacks can be mounted too, given that this gadget allows writing to periodically placed locations in memory. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2021-29947: Mozilla developers and community members reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 87.

The offset might be out-of-range if it comes from an untrusted source, is the result of an incorrect calculation, or occurs because of another error.\n\n\nIf an attacker can control or influence the offset so that it points outside of the intended boundaries of the structure, then the attacker may be able to read or write to memory locations that are used elsewhere in the product.

If the dereferencing operation is for a read, then the attack might allow reading of sensitive data, cause a crash, or set a variable to an unexpected value (since the value will be read from an unexpected memory location).\n\n\nThere are several variants of this weakness, including but not necessarily limited to:\n\n\n  - The untrusted value is directly invoked as a function call.\n\n  - In OS kernels or drivers where there is a boundary between \"userland\" and privileged memory spaces, an untrusted pointer might enter through an API or system call (see CWE-781 for one such example).\n\n  - Inadvertently accepting the value from an untrusted control sphere when it did not have to be accepted as input at all. This might occur when the code was originally developed to be run by a single user in a non-networked environment, and the code is then ported to or otherwise exposed to a networked environment.\n\n",
