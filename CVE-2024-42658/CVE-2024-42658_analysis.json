This is related to the broader issue of **transmitting sensitive information in cleartext (CWE-319)**, as the absence of the 'Secure' attribute can lead to cookies being sent over HTTP. Another contributing factor is the **absence of the 'HttpOnly' flag (CWE-1004)**, making cookies accessible to client-side scripts, potentially increasing the attack surface. All three are variant or base level CWE's, but CWE-614 appears to be the most direct root cause.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe614[\"CWE-614: Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute\"]\n    cwe1004[\"CWE-1004: Sensitive Cookie Without 'HttpOnly' Flag\"]\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n\n    cwe614 -->|RELATED_TO| cwe319\n    cwe1004 -->|RELATED_TO| cwe319\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe614 primary\n    class cwe1004,cwe319 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **insecure handling of cookies**, specifically the **missing 'Secure' attribute (CWE-614)** and **'HttpOnly' flag (CWE-1004)**. This leads to the **transmission of sensitive information in cleartext (CWE-319)**, potentially allowing attackers to intercept and steal cookies, ultimately leading to **unauthorized access and control over the device**, and **exposure of sensitive information**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nBased on the provided evidence, the primary root cause is the **lack of the 'Secure' attribute on sensitive cookies (CWE-614)**. This is directly supported by the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which states that the router firmware lacks sufficient security measures for handling cookies and that cookies are not being set with the HttpOnly and Secure flags. The high retriever score for CWE-614 further supports this classification. CWE-1004 and CWE-319 are contributing factors. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, as they directly address the specific weaknesses identified in the vulnerability description.\nThe evidence clearly points to the insecure configuration of cookies as the root cause, justifying the selection of CWE-614, CWE-1004, and CWE-319.\n\n**CWE Considerations:**\n*   **CWE-425 Direct Request ('Forced Browsing'):** While potentially related, this is a broader issue of inadequate authorization, not specifically cookie-related.\n*   **CWE-472 External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter:** This is also not directly related to the cookie handling issue.\n*   **CWE-784 Reliance on Cookies without Validation and Integrity Checking in a Security Decision:** This is similar to the chosen CWEs, but CWE-614 and CWE-1004 are more specific about the exact issues.\n*   **CWE-798 Use of Hard-coded Credentials**: Not applicable, as the vulnerability is with cookie handling, not credentials.\nRelevant CWE
