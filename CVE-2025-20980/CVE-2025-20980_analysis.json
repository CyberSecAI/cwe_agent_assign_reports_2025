While CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) is a parent of CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write), the description is specific enough to warrant the selection of the more specific child CWE-787. There are also CANFOLLOW relationships to CWE-825, CWE-824, CWE-823, CWE-822 and a PARENTOF relationship to CWE-124.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is relatively simple:\n1.  **Root Cause:** CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) - The code writes data outside the intended buffer.\n2.  **Impact:** Memory corruption, potentially leading to crashes or arbitrary code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description explicitly states \"Out-of-bounds write in libsavscmn\". The CVE reference confirms this. The retriever results also list CWE-787 as the top candidate. Therefore, CWE-787 is the most appropriate mapping.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this
