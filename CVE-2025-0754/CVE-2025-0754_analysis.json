  "cve_id": "CVE-2025-0754",
  "description": "The vulnerability was found in OpenShift Service Mesh 2.6.3 and 2.5.6. This issue occurs due to **improper sanitization of HTTP headers by Envoy**, particularly the x-forwarded-for header. This lack of sanitization can allow attackers to inject malicious payloads into service mesh logs, leading to log injection and spoofing attacks. Such injections can mislead logging mechanisms, enabling attackers to manipulate log entries or execute reflected **cross-site scripting** (XSS) attacks.",

  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-0754 based on provided content:\n\nThis content is directly related to CVE-2025-0754. It's a Red Hat Bugzilla report specifically referencing the CVE. Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information extracted:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nInsufficient sanitization of HTTP headers within the OpenShift Service Mesh, specifically the `x-forwarded-for` header.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Log injection attacks via the `x-forwarded-for` header.\n*   Lack of proper input validation/sanitization of HTTP headers.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   Misleading log entries.\n*   Potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.\n*   Misattribution of request sources.\n*   The impact is limited as it primarily affects logging and doesn't lead to remote code execution or privilege escalation.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Crafting HTTP requests with malicious data in the `x-forwarded-for` header.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   Ability to send HTTP requests to the OpenShift Service Mesh. No specific privileges are required.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n1.  **Filter malicious headers:** Use the `request_headers_to_remove` key to strip potentially malicious headers (including `x-forwarded-for`) from requests.\n2.  **Do not trust `x-forwarded-for`:**\n    *   Set `xff_num_trusted_hops = 0` (no trusted addresses in XFF).\n    *   Set `use_remote_address=true` to use the downstream real IP address instead of relying on the `x-forwarded-for` header (for untrusted environments).\n\n**Additional Details (more detail than official CVE description):**\n\n*   The bug report links to a related CVE (CVE-2025-0752) and suggests the remediation is similar.\n*   The report indicates the vulnerability exists in OpenShift Service Mesh versions 2.6.3 and 2.5.6.\n*   The report is marked as \"NEEDINFO\", indicating further investigation or information is required.",

This leads to two distinct but related weaknesses:\n\n1.  The ability to inject malicious payloads into service mesh logs (CWE-117).\n2.  The potential for reflected XSS attacks (CWE-79).\n\nThus, the chain is: **Improper Sanitization** -> Log Injection (CWE-117) and/or XSS (CWE-79).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-79 as the primary candidate due to the explicit mention of XSS in the vulnerability description. However, the log injection aspect also needed to be addressed. The key phrase \"improper sanitization of HTTP headers by Envoy\" from the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" provides strong evidence for both CWE-79 and CWE-117.\n\nThe graph relationships, particularly the child-of relationship to CWE-20, helped to confirm that both CWE-79 and CWE-117 are specific instances of a broader input validation issue.\n\nThe selection of CWE-79 and CWE-117 at the Base level provides the optimal level of specificity, as these CWEs directly describe the observed weaknesses resulting from the **improper sanitization**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n* Vulnerability Description: \"This issue occurs due to **improper sanitization of HTTP headers by Envoy**, particularly the x-forwarded-for header.
