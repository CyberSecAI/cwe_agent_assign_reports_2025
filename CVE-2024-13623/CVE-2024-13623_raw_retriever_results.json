This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to extract sensitive data stored insecurely in the /wp-content/uploads directory which can contain exported order information. The plugin is only vulnerable when Order data storage is set to WordPress posts storage (legacy), and cannot be exploited when the default option of High-performance order storage is enabled.",
