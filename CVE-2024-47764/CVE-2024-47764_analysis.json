  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-47764:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of cookie names, paths, and domain values during serialization. The `cookie` library was using a broad regular expression (`fieldContentRegExp` from RFC7230) intended for the entire cookie header, instead of more specific regular expressions for individual cookie components (name, path, domain) as defined in RFC6265. This allowed characters beyond the allowed sets.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Inadequate Input Validation:** The library failed to properly validate cookie names, paths, and domains against the specific character sets allowed by RFC6265.\n*   **Incorrect Regular Expression Usage:** A generic regex for the whole header was used for individual parts instead of more restrictive ones.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Cookie Manipulation:** By crafting malicious cookie names, attackers could inject other cookie attributes, such as `Max-Age` and others, leading to unexpected cookie behavior. For example, the attacker could set a username cookie to `<script>` code, resulting in XSS when the cookie value was interpreted in an insecure context.\n*   **Path and Domain Alteration:** Similar manipulation could occur with `path` and `domain`, potentially leading to unexpected cookie scoping and access.\n*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Potential:** The ability to inject script tags directly into cookie values could result in XSS vulnerabilities if the cookie is later used in a page without proper sanitization or escaping.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Malicious Cookie Name/Value:** An attacker could provide a cookie name or value containing characters that exploit the insufficient validation. The name could be constructed to include other cookie directives, like `Max-Age` or `path`.\n*   **Malicious Path/Domain Values:** Similarly, crafted `path` or `domain` values could bypass the validation and lead to unexpected behavior.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Control Over Cookie Attributes:** The attacker needs some control over the cookie name, path, or domain values being serialized by the application. This might involve user input or data from other sources that is not sanitized properly by the application.\n*   **Application Misconfiguration**: The vulnerable cookie library must be used in an application without additional sanitization of the cookie attributes.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n*   The vulnerability is present in versions of the `cookie` library prior to 0.7.0.\n*   The fix was implemented in version 0.7.0 by narrowing the validation using regexes matching the RFC.\n*   The provided content includes a pull request that fixes this issue (PR #167).\n* The content also includes a number of PR's in downstream packages bumping the library version to the fixed version.\n*   The vulnerability is considered \"low\" severity.\n*   The fix involved correcting the regular expressions to match the specific RFC6265 requirements for cookie names, paths, and domains.\n*   The vulnerability can be mitigated by upgrading to version 0.7.0 or later. As a workaround, application developers should avoid using untrusted or arbitrary values for cookie names, paths, and domains, ensuring that these are instead set by the application itself.\n\nThe provided content gives more technical detail than the CVE description.",

This hierarchical relationship indicates a more specific instance of a broader input validation issue. The chain relationship CANPRECEDE -> CWE-79 (Cross-site Scripting) suggests that improper neutralization of CRLF sequences can lead to XSS vulnerabilities. CWE-184 provides a secondary classification for the incomplete nature of the disallowed input list.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe113[\"CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe93[\"CWE-93: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe184[\"CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\"]\n    \n    cwe113 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    cwe113 -->|CHILDOF| cwe93\n    cwe113 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe79\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe113 primary\n    class cwe20,cwe93,cwe79, cwe184 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper escaping** due to **inadequate input validation** of cookie names, paths, and domains. This leads to the ability to inject other cookie attributes, potentially leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if the cookie value is later used without proper sanitization.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **improper escaping** of cookie values, leading to potential injection of malicious content. The evidence from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary clearly indicates that the root cause is due to **insufficient validation** of cookie names, paths, and domains as defined in RFC6265. The `cookie` library incorrectly used a generic regular expression instead of specific ones, leading to an **incomplete list of disallowed inputs**. This directly aligns with CWE-113, as it involves improper neutralization of CRLF sequences in HTTP headers due to insufficient input validation. The relationship analysis further supports this decision, as CWE-113 is a variant of CWE-20 and can precede CWE-79. The selection of CWE-113 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it precisely describes the improper handling of CRLF sequences in HTTP headers, which is the core weakness in this vulnerability. CWE-184 is a secondary weakness as the regex used was too broad.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this
