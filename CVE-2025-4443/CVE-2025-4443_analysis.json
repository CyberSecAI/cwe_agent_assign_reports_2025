  "description": "A vulnerability was found in D-Link DIR-605L 2.13B01. It has been rated as critical. This issue affects the function sub_454F2C. The manipulation of the argument sysCmd leads to **command injection**. The attack may be initiated remotely. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure. This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer.",

The \"Retriever Results\" list both CWE-77 and CWE-78 as top candidates. CWE-78 is a \"Base\" level weakness, while CWE-77 is a \"Class\" level weakness. Given that the description specifies that the **command injection** occurs at the OS level, CWE-78 is a more precise and appropriate mapping. The description explicitly mentions command injection and the vulnerable argument. No other CWEs are strongly indicated.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n## CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended command when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: CWE-77 is often misused when OS command injection (CWE-78) was intended instead [REF-1287].\n\n### Detailed Analysis of Selected CWEs\n\n*   **CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')**\n\n    *   **Match:** The vulnerability description explicitly states \"**command injection**\".
