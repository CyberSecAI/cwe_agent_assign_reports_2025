The existing checks on fp->refcount are not sufficient to prevent this. The fix takes ft->lock around the section which removes the file from the file table. This prevents two threads acquiring the same file pointer via __close_file_table_ids, as well as the other functions which retrieve a file from the IDR and which already use this same lock.
