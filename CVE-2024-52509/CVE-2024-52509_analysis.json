  "description": "Nextcloud Mail is the mail app for Nextcloud, a self-hosted productivity platform. The Nextcloud mail app incorrectly allowed attaching shared files without download permissions as attachments. This allowed users to send them the files to themselves and then downloading it from their mail clients. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Mail is upgraded to 2.2.10, 3.6.2 or 3.7.2.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-52509:\n\n**1. Verification:**\nThe provided content directly relates to CVE-2024-52509. The GitHub security advisory for `GHSA-pwpp-fvcr-w862` explicitly mentions `CVE-2024-52509` and describes the vulnerability.\n\n**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nThe root cause is the Nextcloud Mail app's failure to properly check download permissions when attaching shared files. It allows users to attach files to emails even if they do not have the permission to download them directly.\n\n**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n- **Improper Access Control:** The mail app doesn't enforce the download permissions associated with shared files when creating attachments.\n- **Data Leakage:** Shared files without download permissions can be attached to emails and then downloaded from the email client by the user, bypassing the intended access restrictions.\n\n**4. Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Confidentiality Breach:** Unauthorized users with \"read-only\" share access can bypass the \"no-download\" restriction by emailing the content to themselves and then downloading the file from their email client. This leads to unintended access and exposure of confidential data.\n\n**5. Attack Vectors:**\n- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable via the network, as users interact with the Nextcloud instance through a web browser or email client.\n- **File Sharing:** The attack requires a user to have access to a shared file within Nextcloud, which does not grant download permissions to them.\n\n**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Low Privileges:** The attacker needs a user account on the affected Nextcloud instance.\n- **Read-only Share Access:** The attacker needs access to a file that was shared with them with no download permissions.\n- **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to use the mail application to attach the shared file and send the email to themselves.\n\n**Technical Details:**\n\n- The fix involves checking for download permissions in the `AttachmentService.php` file. The `hasDownloadPermissions` function is added to verify whether the user has download access before allowing a shared file as an attachment.\n- The `AttachmentServiceTest.php` file was updated to include a test case that specifically checks the `handleAttachmentsCloudAttachmentNoDownloadPermission` function, ensuring that files without download permission are not attached.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The vulnerability was reported by rullzer via HackerOne.\n- The fix was implemented in pull request #9592 in the nextcloud/mail repository.\n- The vulnerability impacts versions >= 2.2.0, >= 3.6.0 and >= 3.7.0 of the Nextcloud Mail app.\n- Patched versions include 2.2.10, 3.6.2, and 3.7.2.\n- The CVSS score is 3.5, with a low severity rating.\n- The CWE is CWE-284 (Improper Access Control).",

The hierarchical relationships show that CWE-284 is a class-level CWE, with more specific base-level CWEs existing. Given the provided information, **improper access control** is the identified root cause, and based on the MITRE Guidance, **missing authorization** is an alternative.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe284 primary\n    class cwe862 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper access control**, specifically the failure to check download permissions when attaching shared files. This leads to the impact of **data leakage**, where users can bypass intended access restrictions.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified **improper access control** as the main **weakness**. The vulnerability allows users to bypass download permissions on shared files by attaching those files to emails. The evidence strongly supports the selection of CWE-284, \"Improper Access Control,\" as the primary CWE. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" highlights the **improper access control** as a core weakness and that the mail app doesn't enforce the download permissions. The Retriever Results listed CWE-862 **Missing Authorization** and CWE-639 **Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key** but in this case, the authorization is present but **improperly** controlled by the mail app.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product generates an error message that includes sensitive information about its environment, users, or associated data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
