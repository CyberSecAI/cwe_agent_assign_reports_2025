# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-31494

## Vulnerability Description
AutoGPT is a platform that allows users to create, deploy, and manage continuous artificial intelligence agents that automate complex workflows. The AutoGPT Platforms WebSocket API transmitted node execution updates to subscribers based on the graph_id+graph_version. Additionally, there was no check prohibiting users from subscribing with another users graph_id+graph_version. As a result, node execution updates from one users graph execution could be received by another user within the same instance. This vulnerability does not occur between different instances or between users and non-users of the platform. Single-user instances are not affected. In private instances with a user white-list, the impact is limited by the fact that all potential unintended recipients of these node execution updates must have been admitted by the administrator. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.6.1.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **improper access control**
- **weakness:** **no check prohibiting users from subscribing with another user's graph_id+graph_version**
- **impact:** node execution updates from one user's graph execution could be received by another user
- **product:** AutoGPT Platforms WebSocket API

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-31494 based on provided content:

The provided content directly relates to CVE-2025-31494. Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information extracted from the GitHub security advisory and release notes:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The AutoGPT Platform's WebSocket API transmitted node execution updates based on the `graph_id` + `graph_version` combination without verifying the user's authorization to receive those updates. This allowed users to potentially subscribe to and receive updates from other users' graph executions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **CWE-200:** Improper Input Validation - Lack of user ID verification in WebSocket subscription keys.
*   **CWE-284:** Improper Access Control - Allowing subscriptions based solely on `graph_id` and `graph_version` without user context.

**Impact of exploitation:**

Node execution updates from one user's graph could be received by another user within the same instance, under specific conditions:

*   Multiple users accessing the same graph through the Marketplace.
*   A malicious actor obtaining a `graph_id` and `graph_version` belonging to another user and subscribing directly through the WebSocket API.

The vulnerability *does not* affect different instances or users outside the platform.

**Attack vectors:**

*   Exploitation through the WebSocket API by subscribing to another user's `graph_id` and `graph_version`.
*   Leveraging shared graphs in the Marketplace.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to be a user of the AutoGPT platform.
*   The attacker needs to know or obtain a valid `graph_id` and `graph_version` belonging to another user.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   The problem was patched by adding the `user_id` to the WebSocket event subscription key. (Pull Request [#9660](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT/pull/9660)).
*   The patch was included in AutoGPT Platform v0.6.1.
*   Additional fixes were implemented to improve websocket reliability and security (PRs #9666, #9677, #9688, #9694, #9697).

**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**

*   The vulnerability was self-discovered by the developers.
*   The CVSS score is 3.5/10 (Low severity).
*   The advisory provides details on the CVSS v3 base metrics.
*   The release notes detail other improvements and bug fixes included in v0.6.1.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control

**Authentication**:
Determines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.

* Example phrases: "user must log in", "lack of login check", "bypasses login"
* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.

  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* – used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).

**Authorization**:
Determines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do. It decides access *after* identity is verified.

* Example phrases: "unauthorized access", "regular user can access admin panel", "role checks are missing"
* CWE relevance: use CWEs like 862, 863, 285 for authorization errors:

  * **CWE-862**: *Missing Authorization* – the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all.
  * **CWE-863**: *Incorrect Authorization* – the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).
  * **CWE-285**: *Improper Authorization* – general category for any flawed authorization logic or design.

**Access Control**:
A broader term that includes both authentication and authorization. Governs how resources are protected and who can access them under what conditions.

* CWE relevance:

  * **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* – top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear.
  * This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.

## Mapping Discussion – Common Misclassification Patterns

### 1. **CWE-306 vs CWE-862**:

* **306** is about lack of **authentication** (e.g., *no login required at all*).
* **862** is about lack of **authorization** *after* authentication (e.g., *admin check missing*).
* ✅ Example CWE-306: *“An unauthenticated attacker can invoke the password reset API.”*
* ✅ Example CWE-862: *“An authenticated user without admin privileges can delete any user account.”*

### 2. **CWE-285 vs CWE-284**:

* **285** is specific to authorization flaws – it's a better choice than 284 **if** the issue involves *improper or missing role checks*.
* **284** should be reserved for general access control issues when it’s unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.

---

## Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification

**Phrase like "unauthorized access" is not enough.**

* If you **cannot determine whether identity was checked**, assume it’s **authorization** and consider 862 or 863.
* If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** → CWE-306.
* If the **access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced**, but it's not due to missing checks, consider **CWE-284**.

---

## Good Mapping Examples

* ✅ **CWE-306**: “The endpoint `/admin/deleteUser` does not require any authentication.”
* ✅ **CWE-862**: “Any logged-in user can change any other user's email without being an admin.”
* ✅ **CWE-863**: “An admin check exists but incorrectly grants access to non-admin users.”
* ✅ **CWE-285**: “Application uses a static role check that fails when roles change dynamically.”
* ✅ **CWE-284**: “Inconsistent enforcement of access rules across services with unclear policy source.”
