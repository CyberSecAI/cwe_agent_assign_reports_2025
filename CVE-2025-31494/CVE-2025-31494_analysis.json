  "description": "AutoGPT is a platform that allows users to create, deploy, and manage continuous artificial intelligence agents that automate complex workflows. The AutoGPT Platforms WebSocket API transmitted node execution updates to subscribers based on the graph_id+graph_version. Additionally, there was no check prohibiting users from subscribing with another users graph_id+graph_version. As a result, node execution updates from one users graph execution could be received by another user within the same instance. This vulnerability does not occur between different instances or between users and non-users of the platform. Single-user instances are not affected. In private instances with a user white-list, the impact is limited by the fact that all potential unintended recipients of these node execution updates must have been admitted by the administrator. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.6.1.",

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information extracted from the GitHub security advisory and release notes:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe AutoGPT Platform's WebSocket API transmitted node execution updates based on the `graph_id` + `graph_version` combination without verifying the user's authorization to receive those updates. This allowed users to potentially subscribe to and receive updates from other users' graph executions.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **CWE-200:** Improper Input Validation - Lack of user ID verification in WebSocket subscription keys.\n*   **CWE-284:** Improper Access Control - Allowing subscriptions based solely on `graph_id` and `graph_version` without user context.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nNode execution updates from one user's graph could be received by another user within the same instance, under specific conditions:\n\n*   Multiple users accessing the same graph through the Marketplace.\n*   A malicious actor obtaining a `graph_id` and `graph_version` belonging to another user and subscribing directly through the WebSocket API.\n\nThe vulnerability *does not* affect different instances or users outside the platform.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Exploitation through the WebSocket API by subscribing to another user's `graph_id` and `graph_version`.\n*   Leveraging shared graphs in the Marketplace.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   An attacker needs to be a user of the AutoGPT platform.\n*   The attacker needs to know or obtain a valid `graph_id` and `graph_version` belonging to another user.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   The problem was patched by adding the `user_id` to the WebSocket event subscription key. (Pull Request [#9660](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT/pull/9660)).\n*   The patch was included in AutoGPT Platform v0.6.1.\n*   Additional fixes were implemented to improve websocket reliability and security (PRs #9666, #9677, #9688, #9694, #9697).\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   The vulnerability was self-discovered by the developers.\n*   The CVSS score is 3.5/10 (Low severity).\n*   The advisory provides details on the CVSS v3 base metrics.\n*   The release notes detail other improvements and bug fixes included in v0.6.1.",

CWE-863 is a class-level CWE, and while it would be preferable to have a base-level CWE, there are no base-level children of CWE-863 that perfectly fit. The advisory notes that the fix was to add the `user_id` to the WebSocket event subscription key. CWE-639, Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key, is related because the `graph_id` and `graph_version` acted as keys that bypassed proper authorization checks. CWE-285, Improper Authorization, is a more general classification that could apply, but CWE-863 is more specific.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe639 -->|PEEROF| cwe863\n    cwe285 -->|PEEROF| cwe863\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe639,cwe285 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper access control** due to the **lack of checks prohibiting users from subscribing with another user's graph_id+graph_version**. This leads to the impact where node execution updates from one user's graph execution could be received by another user. The root cause is the **incorrect authorization** (CWE-863) which allowed the bypass.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-863, Incorrect Authorization, because the application performs an authorization check (subscribing to updates) but does it incorrectly. The evidence for this is in the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" with the phrase \"**rootcause:** **improper access control**\" and \"**weakness:** **no check prohibiting users from subscribing with another user's graph_id+graph_version**\". The fix confirms this, because the `user_id` was added to the subscription key. This is also supported by the CVE Reference Links Content Summary which lists \"**CWE-284:** Improper Access Control - Allowing subscriptions based solely on `graph_id` and `graph_version` without user context.\" While the CVE summary indicates CWE-284, and this is very closely related to CWE-863, the weakness is not just a missing authorization, but an incorrect one.\n\nCWE-285 was considered, because it is a parent of CWE-863, but CWE-863 is more specific and accurate.\n\nCWE-306 was not considered, because the users were authenticated and the issue was with authorization after authentication.\n\nCWE-201, Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data, was not considered because the core issue wasn't the insertion of sensitive data, but the improper authorization that allowed users to receive data they shouldn't have.\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
