  "query": "AutoGPT is a platform that allows users to create, deploy, and manage continuous artificial intelligence agents that automate complex workflows. The AutoGPT Platforms WebSocket API transmitted node execution updates to subscribers based on the graph_id+graph_version. Additionally, there was no check prohibiting users from subscribing with another users graph_id+graph_version. As a result, node execution updates from one users graph execution could be received by another user within the same instance. This vulnerability does not occur between different instances or between users and non-users of the platform. Single-user instances are not affected. In private instances with a user white-list, the impact is limited by the fact that all potential unintended recipients of these node execution updates must have been admitted by the administrator. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.6.1.",
