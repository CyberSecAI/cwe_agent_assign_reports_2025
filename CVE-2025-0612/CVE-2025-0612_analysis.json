The impact is the potential to exploit the heap corruption.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability is primarily due to an **out-of-bounds memory access** in the V8 engine, leading to potential **heap corruption**. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions this, and the CVE summary confirms the root cause.\n\nThe selection of CWE-787 is based on the explicit mention of \"out of bounds memory access\". The retriever also lists CWE-787 with a good score.\n\nCWE-122 is considered as a secondary CWE because the description mentions \"heap corruption\". This suggests a heap-based buffer overflow as a possible consequence of the **out-of-bounds write**.\n\nBoth CWEs are at appropriate levels of specificity, with CWE-787 at the Base level and CWE-122 at the Variant level.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-843: Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates or initializes a resource such as a pointer, object, or variable using one type, but it later accesses that resource using a type that is incompatible with the original type.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-416: Use After Free\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reuses or references memory after it has been freed.
