The password is in a configuration file. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-312 **Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information**, a base-level CWE. CWE-260 **Password in Configuration File** is added as a secondary CWE because the password is saved in cleartext inside the configuration file.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe260[\"CWE-260: Password in Configuration File\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe312 primary\n    class cwe260 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is:\n1.  **Root Cause:** CWE-312 **Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information** - The password is saved as cleartext when exporting media types.\n2.
