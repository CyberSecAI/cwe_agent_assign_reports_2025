This then leads to the **bypass authentication to the Skupper console**. The root cause is CWE-798, and the direct impact is authentication bypass (CWE-288).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability stems from the use of a **static cookie-secret**, which is a clear instance of CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials). This allows attackers to bypass authentication, leading to unauthorized access to the Skupper console. The analysis is primarily based on the provided CVE description and reference links. The reference links clearly state that the **root cause** is a **static cookie secret** of 'SECRET', which allows an attacker to forge cookies and bypass authentication. This aligns perfectly with CWE-798.\n\nCWE-288 is included because the **static cookie-secret** provides an alternate, unintended path for authentication. While it's a consequence of CWE-798, it also directly describes the bypass.\n\nCWE-1391 is also included as it is a more general class of weakness encompassing the use of any weak credential.\n\nOther CWEs Considered:\n\n*   CWE-287 (Improper Authentication): This is a higher-level class that is less specific than CWE-798.\n*   CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function): Authentication is not entirely missing but bypassed due to the hardcoded secret.\n*   CWE-862 (Missing Authorization): The issue is with authentication, not authorization.\n*   CWE-784 (Reliance on Cookies without Validation and Integrity Checking in a Security Decision): While cookies are involved, the root cause is the hardcoded secret used to forge them, not the lack of cookie validation.\n*   CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key): Not applicable since the cookie secret is static and not user-controlled.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-798 directly addresses the root cause, while CWE-288 and CWE-1391 provide additional context and impact.",
