# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-27090

## Vulnerability Description
Decidim is a participatory democracy framework, written in Ruby on Rails, originally developed for the Barcelona City government online and offline participation website. If an attacker can infer the slug or URL of an unpublished or private resource, and this resource can be embbeded (such as a Participatory Process, an Assembly, a Proposal, a Result, etc), then some data of this resource could be accessed. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.27.6.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** access resource data
- **vector:** infer slug or URL
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** Decidim
- **version:** prior to 0.27.6

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2024-27090:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of sufficient checks when embedding resources (like Participatory Processes, Assemblies, Proposals, etc.). The application did not properly verify if a resource should be embedded based on its publication status, moderation, withdrawal, or privacy settings.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Inadequate Access Control:** The system lacked proper authorization checks for embedded resources, allowing unauthorized access to content that should have been restricted.
- **Data Leakage:** The embed feature could expose data from unpublished, moderated, withdrawn, or private resources if an attacker knew the resource's slug or URL.
- **Multi-tenancy Issue**: The embed feature could leak data between organizations in a multi-tenant installation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive information from resources that were meant to be private or not yet published.
- **Data Exposure:** Information about moderated or withdrawn content could be revealed through the embed feature.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct URL Access:** An attacker could directly access the embed URL of a resource if they knew or could guess the URL. This URL typically ends with `/embed.html`.
- **Information Inference:** The attacker needs to infer or know the resource's slug or URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Knowledge of Resource Slugs/URLs:** The attacker needs to know the URL of the target resource.
- **No Authentication Required**: The vulnerability could be exploited without requiring authentication.
- **Remote Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited over a network.

**Additional Notes**

- The vulnerability was fixed in version 0.27.6 of the `decidim` application
- The fix involves adding checks to verify if a resource is published, not private or withdrawn before it is allowed to be embedded. It also prevents the embed page from being leaked between organizations in multitenant installations.
- The fix ensures a consistent 404 response when a resource is not supposed to be visible via embed
- A workaround was suggested which is to disallow access to URLs ending with `/embed.html` through web server configuration.
