  "description": "Decidim is a participatory democracy framework, written in Ruby on Rails, originally developed for the Barcelona City government online and offline participation website. If an attacker can infer the slug or URL of an unpublished or private resource, and this resource can be embbeded (such as a Participatory Process, an Assembly, a Proposal, a Result, etc), then some data of this resource could be accessed. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.27.6.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2024-27090:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nThe root cause is a lack of sufficient checks when embedding resources (like Participatory Processes, Assemblies, Proposals, etc.). The application did not properly verify if a resource should be embedded based on its publication status, moderation, withdrawal, or privacy settings.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Inadequate Access Control:** The system lacked proper authorization checks for embedded resources, allowing unauthorized access to content that should have been restricted.\n- **Data Leakage:** The embed feature could expose data from unpublished, moderated, withdrawn, or private resources if an attacker knew the resource's slug or URL.\n- **Multi-tenancy Issue**: The embed feature could leak data between organizations in a multi-tenant installation.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive information from resources that were meant to be private or not yet published.\n- **Data Exposure:** Information about moderated or withdrawn content could be revealed through the embed feature.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Direct URL Access:** An attacker could directly access the embed URL of a resource if they knew or could guess the URL. This URL typically ends with `/embed.html`.\n- **Information Inference:** The attacker needs to infer or know the resource's slug or URL.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Knowledge of Resource Slugs/URLs:** The attacker needs to know the URL of the target resource.\n- **No Authentication Required**: The vulnerability could be exploited without requiring authentication.\n- **Remote Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited over a network.\n\n**Additional Notes**\n\n- The vulnerability was fixed in version 0.27.6 of the `decidim` application\n- The fix involves adding checks to verify if a resource is published, not private or withdrawn before it is allowed to be embedded. It also prevents the embed page from being leaked between organizations in multitenant installations.\n- The fix ensures a consistent 404 response when a resource is not supposed to be visible via embed\n- A workaround was suggested which is to disallow access to URLs ending with `/embed.html` through web server configuration.\n\nThis information is more detailed than what's present in the CVE description, as it provides context from the code commits, pull request discussions, and release notes.",

This aligns with the vulnerability where sensitive data is accessed due to improper access controls on embedded resources.\n\nCWE-425 and CWE-285 were also considered. CWE-425 is a child of CWE-285, representing a more specific case of authorization failure via direct requests. However, because the vulnerability involves multiple aspects of resource exposure (publication status, moderation, etc.), the broader CWE-668 is more appropriate as the primary classification. These could be seen as related issues in a vulnerability chain, but the available evidence focuses on the resource exposure aspect.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    cwe425[\"CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe425 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe668 primary\n    class cwe425,cwe285 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **lack of proper access control** on embedded resources. This **improper access control** leads to the **exposure of data** from unpublished, moderated, or private resources. An attacker can then infer the slug or URL of a restricted resource and access its data via the embed feature.\n\nRoot Cause: **Inadequate access control**.\n\nWeakness: **Exposure of sensitive data**.\n\nImpact: **Confidentiality breach, data exposure**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **lack of sufficient checks** on embedded resources. While several CWEs were considered, CWE-668 most accurately reflects the core issue of exposing resources to the wrong control sphere due to **inadequate access controls**.\n\nThe evidence from the CVE reference links content summary highlights the issue: \"The application did not properly verify if a resource should be embedded based on its publication status, moderation, withdrawal, or privacy settings.\" This directly supports the classification of CWE-668.\n\nCWE-425 could be a secondary concern, it is a **lack of authorization** that allows the exposure to happen in the first place.\n\nCWE-285 was also considered, but it is too generic and doesn't capture the specific context of resource exposure.\n\nThe final decision prioritizes CWE-668 due to its direct alignment with the vulnerability's root cause and the provided evidence, classifying it at the Class level to encapsulate the broader scope of the issue.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-610: Externally Controlled Reference to a Resource in Another Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an externally controlled name or reference that resolves to a resource that is outside of the intended control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
