  "description": "A vulnerability classified as critical was found in code-projects Job Recruitment 1.0. Affected by this vulnerability is the function edit_jobpost of the file /_parse/_all_edits.php. The manipulation of the argument jobtype leads to **sql injection**. The attack can be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. Other parameters might be affected as well.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n- The root cause is an SQL injection vulnerability in the `job-recruitment-in-php` application. Specifically, the `jobtype` parameter from user input is directly concatenated into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection. This occurs when user-supplied input is inserted into a SQL query without proper escaping or using parameterized queries.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database. This could allow them to retrieve sensitive information, such as user credentials, personal data, and other database contents.\n- **Data Manipulation:** An attacker could potentially modify or delete data within the database.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a crafted POST request to the `_parse/_all_edits.php` endpoint.\n- **Malicious Input:** The attacker injects malicious SQL code into the `jobtype` parameter within the POST request.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.\n- **Understanding of SQL:** The attacker should have a basic understanding of SQL syntax and SQL injection techniques to craft the malicious payload.\n- **Targeted Endpoint Knowledge:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable endpoint (`_parse/_all_edits.php`) and the vulnerable parameter (`jobtype`).\n\n**Additional Details from Content:**\n- **Vulnerable Parameters:** The `jobtype` parameter is specifically mentioned as vulnerable, and the `jobtitle` parameter is also noted as controllable, although the primary injection vector is `jobtype`.\n- **Code Analysis:** The description explains that the value of `$jobtype` from the `$_POST['jobtype']` is directly concatenated into SQL statements, highlighting the lack of proper input sanitization.\n- **Proof of Concept (POC):**  A sample HTTP POST request is provided demonstrating how to trigger the vulnerability, including the malicious SQL code injected in the `jobtype` parameter.\n- **Result:** An image shows an error caused by the injected SQL statement, confirming the successful exploitation of the SQL injection vulnerability.\n- **Affected Source:** The vulnerable application is identified as \"job-recruitment-in-php\" from `code-projects.org`.",

The **SQL injection** is the root cause of the vulnerability. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-89, which is a base-level CWE. This accurately represents the **SQL Injection** vulnerability described. There are no direct parent-child relationships that would lead to a more specific CWE. The chain relationship isn't directly applicable here as we are focused on the root cause. The abstraction level is optimal as it's a Base CWE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    \n    class cwe89 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper neutralization** of the `jobtype` parameter, leading directly to **SQL injection**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe assessment is based on the provided evidence, particularly the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" which clearly states **\"weakness: sql injection\"** and the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" that identifies the lack of sanitization of the `jobtype` parameter as the root cause. The retriever results strongly support CWE-89 as the primary CWE.
