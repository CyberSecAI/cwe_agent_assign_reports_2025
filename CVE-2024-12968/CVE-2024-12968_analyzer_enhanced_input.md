## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability classified as critical was found in code-projects Job Recruitment 1.0. Affected by this vulnerability is the function edit_jobpost of the file /_parse/_all_edits.php. The manipulation of the argument jobtype leads to **sql injection**. The attack can be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. Other parameters might be affected as well.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **sql injection**
- **product:** code-projects Job Recruitment
- **version:** 1.0
- **component:** /_parse/_all_edits.php edit_jobpost function

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is an SQL injection vulnerability in the `job-recruitment-in-php` application. Specifically, the `jobtype` parameter from user input is directly concatenated into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection. This occurs when user-supplied input is inserted into a SQL query without proper escaping or using parameterized queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database. This could allow them to retrieve sensitive information, such as user credentials, personal data, and other database contents.
- **Data Manipulation:** An attacker could potentially modify or delete data within the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a crafted POST request to the `_parse/_all_edits.php` endpoint.
- **Malicious Input:** The attacker injects malicious SQL code into the `jobtype` parameter within the POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
- **Understanding of SQL:** The attacker should have a basic understanding of SQL syntax and SQL injection techniques to craft the malicious payload.
- **Targeted Endpoint Knowledge:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable endpoint (`_parse/_all_edits.php`) and the vulnerable parameter (`jobtype`).

**Additional Details from Content:**
- **Vulnerable Parameters:** The `jobtype` parameter is specifically mentioned as vulnerable, and the `jobtitle` parameter is also noted as controllable, although the primary injection vector is `jobtype`.
- **Code Analysis:** The description explains that the value of `$jobtype` from the `$_POST['jobtype']` is directly concatenated into SQL statements, highlighting the lack of proper input sanitization.
- **Proof of Concept (POC):**  A sample HTTP POST request is provided demonstrating how to trigger the vulnerability, including the malicious SQL code injected in the `jobtype` parameter.
- **Result:** An image shows an error caused by the injected SQL statement, confirming the successful exploitation of the SQL injection vulnerability.
- **Affected Source:** The vulnerable application is identified as "job-recruitment-in-php" from `code-projects.org`.
