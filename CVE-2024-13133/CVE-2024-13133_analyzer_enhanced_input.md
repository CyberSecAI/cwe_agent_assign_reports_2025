## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, has been found in ZeroWdd studentmanager 1.0. This issue affects the function addStudent/editStudent of the file src/main/Java/com/wdd/studentmanager/controller/StudentController. java. The manipulation of the argument file leads to **unrestricted upload**. The attack may be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **unrestricted upload**
- **vector:** manipulation of the argument file
- **product:** ZeroWdd studentmanager
- **version:** 1.0
- **component:** src/main/Java/com/wdd/studentmanager/controller/StudentController.java

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content relates to CVE-2024-13133.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The `addStudent`, `editStudent`, `addTeacher`, and `editTeacher` methods in the `studentmanager` application do not restrict file extensions or content during file uploads.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unrestricted file upload. The application does not validate the type or content of the uploaded files.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary file upload, allowing an attacker to upload malicious files (e.g., JSP trojan files or HTML files).
- After a server restart, the attacker could potentially access uploaded HTML files directly. While JSP files are downloaded rather than executed by the server, this still presents a security risk.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker can upload malicious files through the student or teacher modification interfaces.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access the user interface of the application and have the privileges to add or modify students or teachers.
- Knowledge of the application's upload functionality.
