## Vulnerability Description
Git LFS is a Git extension for versioning large files. When Git LFS requests credentials from Git for a remote host, it passes portions of the hosts URL to the `git-credential(1)` command without checking for embedded line-ending control characters, and then sends any credentials it receives back from the Git credential helper to the remote host. By inserting URL-encoded control characters such as line feed (LF) or carriage return (CR) characters into the URL, an attacker may be able to retrieve a users Git credentials. This problem exists in all previous versions and is patched in v3.6.1. All users should upgrade to v3.6.1. There are no workarounds known at this time.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **line-ending control character insertion**
- **impact:** retrieve Git credentials
- **vector:** inserting URL-encoded control characters
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** Git LFS
- **version:** all previous versions

*   **Relates to CVE-2024-53263:** YES
*   **Extraction:**
    *   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Git LFS did not check for embedded line-ending control characters in the URL passed to the `git-credential(1)` command.
    *   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Allows retrieval of credentials via crafted HTTP URLs.
    *   **Impact of exploitation:** By inserting URL-encoded control characters (e.g., line feed (LF) or carriage return (CR)) into the URL, an attacker may be able to retrieve a user's Git credentials.
    *   **Attack vectors:** Inserting URL-encoded control characters into the URL.
    *   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  An attacker needs to craft a malicious URL. User interaction (active) is required.
    *   **Mitigation or fix:** Upgrade to Git LFS v3.6.1.
    *   **More detail than the official CVE description:** YES, the content provides details about how the vulnerability can be exploited.
