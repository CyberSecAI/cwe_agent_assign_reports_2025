# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2025-23020
## Query
An issue was discovered in Kwik before 0.10.1. A hash collision vulnerability (in the hash table used to manage connections) allows remote attackers to cause a considerable CPU load on the server (a Hash DoS attack) by initiating connections with colliding Source Connection IDs (SCIDs).

## Keyphrases
- **weakness**: 'hash collision vulnerability', 'weakness in hash table'
