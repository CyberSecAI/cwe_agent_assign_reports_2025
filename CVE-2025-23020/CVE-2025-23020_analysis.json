It identifies several vulnerable libraries and provides details about the attack.\n\nThe following implementations are listed as vulnerable:\n*   [kwik](https://github.com/ptrd/kwik) 0.10.0 and all earlier versions (fixed in 0.10.1), tracked under CVE-2025-23020\n\nThe advisory explains that the vulnerability exploits algorithmic complexity of hash tables when pushing them to their worst-case complexity. It mentions the use of weak hash functions in connection ID management within QUIC implementations.\n\n*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the use of weak hash functions in the QUIC implementations for managing connections, specifically when using peer Source Connection IDs (SCIDs).\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Hash DoS attacks due to the use of weak hash functions for connection ID management.\n*   **Impact of exploitation:** Significantly slow down vulnerable servers by forcing them to spend the majority of their computing power inserting and looking up colliding connection IDs. Experimental results showed a factor 300 slowdown with 10k parallel connections.\n*   **Attack vectors:** The attacker can freely choose Source Connection IDs (SCIDs) that collide under the target hash function.\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to initiate QUIC connections and control the Source Connection ID.\n*   **Mitigation or fix:** The advisory states that kwik 0.10.1 has fixed this vulnerability.\n```",

The vulnerability stems from the **inefficient algorithmic complexity** of the hash table, which leads to a Hash DoS attack. |\n| CWE-328 | Use of Weak Hash | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE.

CWE-328 is a Base-level CWE that specifies the use of a weak hash algorithm, which can lead to collisions and DoS attacks. CWE-328 is related to CWE-407 because a weak hash function is a common cause of inefficient algorithmic complexity in hash table implementations.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe407[\"CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity\"]\n    cwe328[\"CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash\"]\n    \n    cwe328 -->|CAN_RESULT_IN| cwe407\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe407 primary\n    class cwe328 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **use of a weak hash** (CWE-328), leading to **hash collisions**.
