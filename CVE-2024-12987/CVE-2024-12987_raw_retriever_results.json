Affected is an unknown function of the file /cgi-bin/mainfunction.cgi/apmcfgupload of the component Web Management Interface. The manipulation of the argument session leads to os command injection. It is possible to launch the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. Upgrading to version 1.5.1.5 is able to address this issue. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component.",
