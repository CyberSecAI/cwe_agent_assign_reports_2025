## Vulnerability Description
Snowflake, a platform for using artificial intelligence in the context of cloud computing, has a vulnerability in the Snowflake JDBC driver (Driver) in versions 3.0.13 through 3.23.0 of the driver. When the logging level was set to DEBUG, the Driver would log locally the client-side encryption master key of the target stage during the execution of GET/PUT commands. This key by itself does not grant access to any sensitive data without additional access authorizations, and is not logged server-side by Snowflake. Snowflake fixed the issue in version 3.23.1.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** log locally the client-side encryption master key
- **product:** Snowflake JDBC driver
- **version:** 3.0.13 through 3.23.0

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The Snowflake JDBC driver logged the client-side encryption master key in DEBUG logs during GET/PUT commands.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The vulnerability is CWE-532 (Information Exposure).
- Impact of exploitation: The key itself does not grant access to any sensitive data without additional access authorizations.
- Attack vectors: An attacker needs local access to the logs.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to have local access to the logs and the logging level set to DEBUG.
- Mitigation or fix: Upgrade to Snowflake JDBC driver version 3.23.1.
- More detail than the official CVE description: The content describes the issue, affected versions, patched versions, vulnerability details, solution, severity, CVSS score, and provides a link to the Vulnerability Disclosure Program.
