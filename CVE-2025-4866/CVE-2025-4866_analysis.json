  "reference_content": "**CVE-2025-4866 - Analysis of Provided Content**\n\nThe provided content details a vulnerability in the Rillflow management console, specifically an **Aviator Expression Injection** leading to **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**. This directly relates to a security issue and provides substantial details.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe root cause is the ability for attackers to create process lists and set input mappings for nodes that process Aviator expressions without proper restrictions on what those expressions can do. Specifically, the vulnerability stems from the lack of restrictions on loading external classes within the Aviator expression evaluation.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **Unsafe Expression Evaluation:** The application uses Aviator expressions without sufficient sanitization or restrictions.\n*   **Lack of Class Loading Restrictions:** Aviator is allowed to load external classes, enabling arbitrary code execution.\n*   **Input Injection:** Attackers can inject malicious Aviator expressions through input mappings.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nSuccessful exploitation allows an attacker to escalate from a web user to gain machine privileges through Remote Code Execution.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n1.  Create a process list in the Rillflow management console.\n2.  Import a malicious demo file containing a crafted Aviator expression.\n3.  Configure input mappings to execute the malicious expression.\n4.  Trigger the execution of the process, leading to RCE.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   An attacker needs to be a web user with the ability to create process lists and import files into the Rillflow management console.\n*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious Aviator expression that leverages class loading to execute arbitrary code.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\nThe suggested mitigation is to configure Aviator to prohibit the loading of external classes. This can be achieved by setting the classes in the whitelist to empty. A link to relevant documentation is provided: <https://www.yuque.com/boyan-avfmj/aviatorscript/yr1oau>\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\nThe content provides a detailed proof of concept, including a sample payload and step-by-step instructions for exploitation. This level of detail goes beyond the typical CVE description.",

CWE-1336, also a base-level CWE, represents **improper neutralization of special elements used in a template engine**, and it's a child of CWE-94. The relationship analysis shows that the vulnerability can be seen as a specific instance of code injection where the template engine is involved. This influences the selection as the Aviator Expression Injection, leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE) aligns with the template engine context.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n    cwe1336[\"CWE-1336: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine\"]\n    \n    cwe1336 -->|CHILDOF| cwe94\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe94 primary\n    class cwe1336 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper neutralization** of special elements within Aviator expressions, which leads to the **improper control of code generation** (CWE-94). This ultimately results in remote code execution (RCE).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **code injection** aspect of the vulnerability. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section provided detailed information about the **root cause** being the **Aviator Expression Injection**, where the lack of restrictions on loading external classes leads to Remote Code Execution (RCE). The retriever results showed CWE-94 (Improper Control of Generation of Code) and CWE-1336 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine) as potential candidates.\n\nCWE-94 is selected as the primary because it directly addresses the **code injection** vulnerability stemming from **improper control of code generation**. The relationship analysis shows that CWE-1336 is a child of CWE-94. This means that CWE-1336 could be a more specific case of CWE-94, but the content summary focuses more on the overall **code injection** aspect rather than solely on the template engine.\n\nThe selection of CWE-94 is further justified by the MITRE mapping guidance, which allows CWE-94 with review, stating that it can be misused if only considering \"code execution\". However, this case involves **improper control of code generation** via Aviator expressions, making it a valid choice.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.

        "extended_description": "\n\nThis weakness can lead to a vulnerability in environments in which the attacker does not have direct access to the operating system, such as in web applications. Alternately, if the weakness occurs in a privileged program, it could allow the attacker to specify commands that normally would not be accessible, or to call alternate commands with privileges that the attacker does not have. The problem is exacerbated if the compromised process does not follow the principle of least privilege, because the attacker-controlled commands may run with special system privileges that increases the amount of damage.\n\n\nThere are at least two subtypes of OS command injection:\n\n\n  - The application intends to execute a single, fixed program that is under its own control. It intends to use externally-supplied inputs as arguments to that program. For example, the program might use system(\"nslookup [HOSTNAME]\") to run nslookup and allow the user to supply a HOSTNAME, which is used as an argument. Attackers cannot prevent nslookup from executing. However, if the program does not remove command separators from the HOSTNAME argument, attackers could place the separators into the arguments, which allows them to execute their own program after nslookup has finished executing.\n\n  - The application accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run, as well as which commands to use. The application simply redirects this entire command to the operating system. For example, the program might use \"exec([COMMAND])\" to execute the [COMMAND] that was supplied by the user. If the COMMAND is under attacker control, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or programs. If the command is being executed using functions like exec() and CreateProcess(), the attacker might not be able to combine multiple commands together in the same line.\n\nFrom a weakness standpoint, these variants represent distinct programmer errors. In the first variant, the programmer clearly intends that input from untrusted parties will be part of the arguments in the command to be executed. In the second variant, the programmer does not intend for the command to be accessible to any untrusted party, but the programmer probably has not accounted for alternate ways in which malicious attackers can provide input.",
