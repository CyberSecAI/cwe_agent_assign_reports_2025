CWE-285 is chosen as the primary because the vulnerability description specifically mentions \"**Improper Authorization vulnerability**\". Both CWE-862 and CWE-863 are considered as secondary candidates because they represent specific types of authorization issues, and it is unclear whether authorization is missing or incorrect. The abstraction levels influenced the choice, preferring more specific classifications over the general CWE-284.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe285 primary\n    class cwe862,cwe863 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **Improper Authorization** (CWE-285) due to the **lack of proper restriction or enforcement of permissions**. This leads to a Security feature bypass.\n- Root Cause: Improper Authorization (CWE-285)\n- Impact: Security Feature Bypass\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability, which the description clearly states as an \"**Improper Authorization vulnerability**\". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this by stating the root cause is \"Improper Access Control (CWE-284)\". However, since the vulnerability description specifically mentions \"Authorization\", CWE-285 is a more appropriate choice than CWE-284.\n\nThe Retriever Results listed several candidate CWEs, with CWE-284, CWE-285, CWE-863, CWE-639, and CWE-862 having high similarity scores. Given the guidance to prefer more specific CWEs when available and the clear indication of an authorization problem, I selected CWE-285 as the primary CWE. CWE-862 and CWE-863 were considered as secondary candidates because it is unclear if Authorization is missing (CWE-862) or Incorrect (CWE-863).\n\nThe final decision is based on the evidence from the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, combined with the CWE relationship analysis and mapping guidance. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, providing a clear and accurate representation of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n**CWE-285: Improper Authorization**\n\n*   **Technical Explanation:** The product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.

CWE-285 is chosen as the primary because the vulnerability description specifically mentions \"**Improper Authorization vulnerability**\". Both CWE-862 and CWE-863 are considered as secondary candidates because they represent specific types of authorization issues, and it is unclear whether authorization is missing or incorrect. The abstraction levels influenced the choice, preferring more specific classifications over the general CWE-284.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe285 primary\n    class cwe862,cwe863 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **Improper Authorization** (CWE-285) due to the **lack of proper restriction or enforcement of permissions**.
