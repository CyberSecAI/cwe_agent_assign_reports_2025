This is due to **insufficient verification on the user being returned by the social login token**. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator, if they have access to the email and the user does not have an already-existing account for the service returning the token.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-10114:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\n*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient verification of the user data returned by the social login token. This lack of proper validation allows attackers to potentially bypass the authentication process.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Improper Authentication:** The plugin fails to adequately verify the identity of users logging in through social media.\n*   **Authentication Bypass:** Unauthenticated attackers can exploit this vulnerability to gain access to user accounts, including administrative accounts.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Account Takeover:** Attackers can log in as any existing user on the site.\n*   **Privilege Escalation:** By gaining access to administrator accounts, attackers can take complete control of the WordPress site, leading to potential data breaches, website defacement, malware injection, or denial of service.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   The attack vector is primarily **network-based (AV:N)**, meaning the attacker can exploit this remotely.\n*   The attack requires a **high level of effort (AC:H)** from the attacker as they need to know the target user's email address and that the user not have an already existing account for the specific social service used to create the token.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   The attacker needs to know the email address of a target user on the WordPress site.\n*   The attacker needs to access the email that was used to create the user, in the case a token is generated from it.\n*   The targeted user should not have an already-existing account with the social login service being used in the attack.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n*   The vulnerability affects all versions of the \"Social Login - WordPress / WooCommerce Plugin\" up to and including 2.7.7.\n*   The fix is available in version 2.7.8 where enhanced security measures are implemented for login.\n* The CVSS score of 8.1 indicates a high severity of this issue.",

CWE-288 was selected as it more accurately captures the specific method of authentication bypass via **insufficient verification** of the social login token, which acts as an alternate authentication channel. While CWE-306 could also be considered, the existence of an authentication process (albeit flawed) makes CWE-288 a more precise fit. CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) was also considered as a potential classification but deemed less appropriate as the core issue lies in the authentication phase rather than a faulty authorization mechanism.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe288[\"CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe288 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe288 primary\n    class cwe306,cwe863 secondary\n    class cwe287 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **insufficient verification** of the user being returned by the social login token (CWE-288). This leads to the impact of authentication bypass, allowing unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user, including administrators.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial assessment focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **insufficient verification** of the social login token. The description clearly indicates that this **lack of proper validation** allows attackers to bypass authentication.\n\nThe retriever results and CWE specifications helped refine the choice to CWE-288. The primary CWE match for similar vulnerabilities was CWE-288, further supporting this selection. The relationship analysis highlighted the importance of choosing the most specific CWE, leading to the selection of CWE-288 over its parent CWE-287.\n\nThe final decision is based on the evidence from the vulnerability description and the supporting information from the retriever results and CWE specifications. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, accurately representing the weakness and its impact.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were

Web applications often mistakenly make the assumption that data passed to the client in hidden fields or cookies is not susceptible to tampering. Improper validation of data that are user-controllable can lead to the application processing incorrect, and often malicious, input.\n\n\nFor example, custom cookies commonly store session data or persistent data across sessions. This kind of session data is normally involved in security related decisions on the server side, such as user authentication and access control. Thus, the cookies might contain sensitive data such as user credentials and privileges. This is a dangerous practice, as it can often lead to improper reliance on the value of the client-provided cookie by the server side application.\n",
