  "description": "A vulnerability was found in D-Link DNS-320, DNS-320LW, DNS-325 and DNS-340L up to 20241028. It has been declared as critical. Affected by this vulnerability is the function cgi_user_add of the file /cgi-bin/account_mgr.cgi?cmd=cgi_user_add. The manipulation of the argument name leads to **os command injection**. The attack can be launched remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation appears to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n- The vulnerability lies in the `cgi_user_add` command within D-Link NAS devices. The `name` parameter of this command is not properly sanitized.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Command Injection:** The lack of proper sanitization allows an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands via the `name` parameter. This is achieved by crafting a specific HTTP GET request.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute shell commands on the affected device. This could lead to a variety of malicious activities, including data theft, malware installation, or complete device takeover.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **HTTP GET Requests:** The vulnerability can be triggered by sending specially crafted HTTP GET requests to the device's web interface.\n- **Unauthenticated Access:** The exploit does not require authentication, making it accessible to any attacker who can reach the vulnerable device's web interface.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device. This could be achieved via local network access or from the public internet if the device's management interface is exposed.\n- **Basic Knowledge of HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to construct the malicious HTTP GET request.\n\n**Technical Details:**\n- A sample exploit is provided as a curl request:\n   `curl \"http://[Target-IP]/cgi-bin/account_mgr.cgi cmd=cgi_user_add&name=%27;<INJECTED_SHELL_COMMAND>;%27\"`\n- This request shows how the `name` parameter is used to inject shell commands within single quotes.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n- The vulnerability affects multiple D-Link NAS models, specifically: DNS-320, DNS-320LW, DNS-325, and DNS-340L.\n-  The vendor, D-Link, has stated they will not issue a patch for this vulnerability due to the products being end-of-life, advising users to retire the vulnerable devices.\n- If retirement is not immediately possible, D-Link advises to isolate the devices from the public internet or implement stricter access control.\n-  A large number of vulnerable devices (over 60,000) have been identified exposed to the internet, highlighting the broad attack surface.\n- This vulnerability is similar to a previous one (CVE-2024-3273) affecting the same D-Link NAS devices.",

CWE-78 has a child relationship to CWE-77 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')), which is a Class level CWE and is less specific.

The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms that the `name` parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands. The evidence is strong, and the provided exploit example further validates this assessment. The Retriever Results and \"CWE for similar CVE Descriptions\" also support CWE-78 as the primary CWE. Other CWEs like CWE-77, CWE-89, CWE-79, and CWE-22 were considered but are either too general or not directly applicable to the specific vulnerability of **OS command injection** via the `name` parameter.

It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-134: Use of Externally-Controlled Format String\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a function that accepts a format string as an argument, but the format string originates from an external source.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product requires authentication, but the product has an alternate path or channel that does not require authentication.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names. The associated manipulations are intended to generate multiple names for the same object.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 1333.79\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component. Without sufficient removal or quoting of SQL syntax in user-controllable inputs, the generated SQL query can cause those inputs to be interpreted as SQL instead of ordinary user data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**:\n\n\n## CWE Relationship Analysis\n\nCurrent CWEs represent these abstraction levels: .\n\n\n### Vulnerability Chain Analysis\n\n**Chain starting from CWE-288:**\n- 288 (Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel) - ROOT\n\n\n**Chain starting from CWE-89:**\n- 89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')) - ROOT\n\n\n\n### CWE Relationship Diagram\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n```",
