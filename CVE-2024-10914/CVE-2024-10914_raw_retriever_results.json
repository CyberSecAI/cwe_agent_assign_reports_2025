Affected by this vulnerability is the function cgi_user_add of the file /cgi-bin/account_mgr.cgi?cmd=cgi_user_add. The manipulation of the argument name leads to os command injection. The attack can be launched remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation appears to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.",
