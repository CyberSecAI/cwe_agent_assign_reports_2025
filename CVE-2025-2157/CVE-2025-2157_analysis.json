Verification:**\n\nThe content *does* relate to CVE-2025-2157. The Red Hat Bugzilla entry explicitly links to the CVE (\"CVE-2025-2157 foreman: Disclosure of Executed Commands and Outputs in Foreman / Red Hat Satellite\") and includes the CVE ID in the bug summary.\n\n**2. Extracted Information:**\n\n*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper permissions on temporary files created under `/var/tmp` during job execution in Foreman/Red Hat Satellite.\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information disclosure due to overly permissive file permissions.\n*   **Impact of exploitation:** Low-privileged OS users can access and read command execution outputs, potentially exposing sensitive information (system credentials, configuration details).\n*   **Attack vectors:** Accessing temporary files in `/var/tmp` before they are deleted.\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Low-privileged OS user. No privilege escalation is directly granted, but the disclosed information could be used in further attacks.\n*   **Mitigation or fix:** Not specified in this content.\n\n**3. Additional Details (compared to a hypothetical CVE description):**\n\nThis bug report provides more detail than a typical CVE description would. It specifically identifies the location of the vulnerable files (`/var/tmp`) and clarifies that the vulnerability doesn't lead to direct privilege escalation, but increases the risk of information disclosure.\n\n**4. Content Type:**\n\nThis content is a bug report from Red Hat Bugzilla.",

CWE-379 is related to CWE-732 in that incorrect permissions could lead to the insecure creation of temporary files. Therefore, the primary weakness is CWE-732 with CWE-379 as a secondary candidate.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe732[\"CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\"]\n    cwe379[\"CWE-379: Creation of Temporary File in Directory with Insecure Permissions\"]\n    \n    cwe379 -->|RELATED| cwe732\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe732 primary\n    class cwe379 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with **improper file permissions** (CWE-732), which leads to low-privileged OS users gaining access to temporary files. This access then results in information disclosure, and potentially privilege escalation if the disclosed information is used effectively.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified **improper file permissions** as the root cause, leading to the selection of CWE-732 as the primary CWE. The retriever results and complete CWE specifications supported this choice.\n\nThe evidence supporting CWE-732 is strong, as the vulnerability description explicitly states \"**improper file permissions** allow low-privileged OS users to monitor and access temporary files\". This aligns perfectly with the definition of CWE-732, which involves specifying permissions for a security-critical resource in a way that allows unintended actors to read or modify it. The \"**rootcause:** **improper file permissions**\" key phrase also reinforces this mapping. The provided CVE reference links content summary also mentions \"Improper permissions on temporary files created under `/var/tmp` during job execution\".\n\nCWE-379, Creation of Temporary File in Directory with Insecure Permissions, was considered as a possible secondary CWE since the vulnerability involves temporary files. The vulnerability description mentions \"temporary files under /var/tmp\" and the CVE reference links content summary also mentions \"Improper permissions on temporary files created under `/var/tmp` during job execution\". This reinforces the relevance of CWE-379.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-732 captures the general issue of incorrect permission assignment, while CWE-379 provides a more specific context of temporary files.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
