  "description": "In version 3.23.0 of aimhubio/aim, certain methods that request data from external servers do not have set timeouts, causing the server to wait indefinitely for a response. This can lead to a denial of service, as the tracking server does not respond to other requests while waiting. The issue arises in the client used by the `aim` tracking server to communicate with external resources, specifically in the `_run_read_instructions` method and similar calls without timeouts.",

While a more specific Base CWE would normally be preferred, the vulnerability description focuses on the result of the **resource consumption** and does not provide details on how the **resource consumption** is triggered beyond a lack of timeout. The secondary CWE, CWE-1088 [Synchronous Access of Remote Resource without Timeout], is a more specific weakness that directly relates to the technical cause, and it contributes to resource consumption.\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe1088[\"CWE-1088: Synchronous Access of Remote Resource without Timeout\"]\n    \n    cwe1088 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe400\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe400 primary\n    class cwe1088 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing timeout** in the `_run_read_instructions` method and similar calls (CWE-1088). This leads to the server waiting indefinitely for a response, resulting in **uncontrolled resource consumption** (CWE-400). The impact is a denial of service, as the tracking server becomes unresponsive to other requests.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment considered CWE-1088 as a strong candidate because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions the **missing timeout**. However, the denial-of-service impact and the broader implication of the server's unresponsiveness to other requests pointed towards CWE-400 as the primary issue, with CWE-1088 contributing to the resource consumption.\n\nThe evidence supporting this assessment comes directly from the vulnerability description: \"certain methods that request data from external servers do not have set timeouts, causing the server to wait indefinitely for a response. This can lead to a denial of service, as the tracking server does not respond to other requests while waiting.\"\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the selection by highlighting how CWE-1088 can precede CWE-400, indicating that the **missing timeout** leads to **uncontrolled resource consumption**.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately represent both the root cause (missing timeout) and the resulting impact (denial of service due to resource consumption). A more specific variant of CWE-400 is not available without further information on the nature of the **resource consumption**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe
