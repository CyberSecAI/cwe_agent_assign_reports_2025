# Enhanced Analysis for CVE-2025-24829

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-427 | Uncontrolled Search Path Element | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-668 | Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere | 0.6 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship influencing the decision is the hierarchical one. CWE-427 is a Base level CWE and a child of CWE-668. Since the vulnerability is clearly about the search path being exploitable, CWE-427 is more specific and appropriate than its parent.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with an **uncontrolled search path element** (CWE-427), which allows an attacker to introduce a malicious DLL. The system then loads this DLL from the attacker-controlled path, leading to code execution with the privileges of the application. This results in local privilege escalation, as the attacker can now execute code with higher privileges than they initially had.

## Summary of Analysis
The primary weakness identified is **DLL hijacking**, which is a consequence of an **uncontrolled search path element**. The system searches for DLLs in a predictable order, and if an attacker can place a malicious DLL in a higher-priority location, the system will load and execute it. This is a clear instance of CWE-427 (Uncontrolled Search Path Element).

The vulnerability description clearly states "**DLL hijacking vulnerability**" as the root cause. This aligns perfectly with the concept of an uncontrolled search path. The impact is privilege escalation, which is a common consequence of DLL hijacking. The affected product is Acronis Cyber Protect Cloud Agent, which further narrows down the context of the vulnerability.

CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere) was considered because CWE-427 is a child of it. However, CWE-427 is more specific and accurately captures the root cause.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.80
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
During installation, installed file permissions are set to allow anyone to modify those files.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges 
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions. This may cause it to follow unexpected code paths that may leave the product in an invalid state.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.



## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.



## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names. The associated manipulations are intended to generate multiple names for the same object.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-427: Uncontrolled Search Path Element
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a fixed or controlled search path to find resources, but one or more locations in that path can be under the control of unintended actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-250: Execution with Unnecessary Privileges
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product performs an operation at a privilege level that is higher than the minimum level required, which creates new weaknesses or amplifies the consequences of other weaknesses.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 1214.18
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product specifies permissions for a security-critical resource in a way that allows that resource to be read or modified by unintended actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: While the name itself indicates an assignment of permissions for resources, this is often misused for vulnerabilities in which "permissions" are not checked, which is an "authorization" weakness (CWE-285 or descendants) within CWE's model [REF-1287].



## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 1202.91
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 1182.76
**Source**: sparse
