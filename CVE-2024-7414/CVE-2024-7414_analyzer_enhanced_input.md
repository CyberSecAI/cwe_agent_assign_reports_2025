## Vulnerability Description
The PDF Builder for WPForms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Full Path Disclosure in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.116. This is due to the plugin allowing direct access to the composer-setup.php file which has display_errors on. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve the full path of the web application, which can be used to aid other attacks. The information displayed is not useful on its own, and requires another vulnerability to be present for damage to an affected website.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
### CVE-2024-7414 Analysis:

Based on the provided information, the vulnerability identified as CVE-2024-7414 is a Full Path Disclosure vulnerability affecting the "PDF Builder for WPForms" WordPress plugin.

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the plugin's inclusion of the `composer-setup.php` file within its directory structure, which is directly accessible. This file has `display_errors` enabled.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Full Path Disclosure:** The primary weakness is the exposure of the server's file system path due to the `display_errors` setting in the `composer-setup.php` file. This file is not intended to be accessed directly through the web.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers to obtain the full server path of the WordPress installation. This information can be used by attackers to gain a deeper understanding of the server's configuration, which could be a stepping stone for further attacks.
*   **Limited Direct Impact:** It's important to note that the vulnerability itself does not directly allow for code execution or direct manipulation of the website's data. The information gained from this vulnerability is most useful when chained with other exploits.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct Web Request:** An attacker can retrieve the full path by directly requesting the vulnerable file (`composer-setup.php`) via an HTTP request.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability is accessible to unauthenticated users of the website.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Special Privileges:** The attacker does not need any special privileges or prior access to the WordPress website.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker only needs network access to send HTTP requests to the website.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerable file is located within the plugin's vendor directory, specifically: `pdf-builder-for-wpforms/trunk/vendor/jurosh/pdf-merge/bin/composer-setup.php`
*   The vulnerability affects all versions of the plugin up to and including 1.2.116.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.2.117 of the plugin.
*   The `composer-setup.php` file is part of the `jurosh/pdf-merge` dependency.

**Summary:**

The vulnerability is a medium-severity issue as it allows for information disclosure that could facilitate further attacks. However, the vulnerability itself doesn't directly lead to significant damage to an affected website.
