# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-8453

# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-8453
## Query
Certain switch models from PLANET Technology use an insecure hashing function to hash user passwords without being salted. Remote attackers with administrator privileges can read configuration files to obtain the hash values, and potentially crack them to retrieve the plaintext passwords.

## Keyphrases
- **weakness**: 'insecure hashing function'
