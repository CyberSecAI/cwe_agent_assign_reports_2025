## Vulnerability Description
Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. A vulnerability was discovered in Argo CD that **exposed secret values in error messages** and the diff view when an invalid Kubernetes Secret resource was synced from a repository. The vulnerability assumes the user has write access to the repository and can exploit it, either intentionally or unintentionally, by committing an invalid Secret to repository and triggering a Sync. Once exploited, any user with read access to Argo CD can view the exposed secret data. The vulnerability is fixed in v2.13.4, v2.12.10, and v2.11.13.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **improper input sanitization**
- **weakness:** **exposed secret values in error messages**
- **impact:** view secret data and read access
- **vector:** invalid Kubernetes Secret resource
- **attacker:** user with write access to the repository
- **product:** Argo CD
- **version:** 'v2.11.13'] and 'v2.12.10' and ['v2.13.4'

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
```text
Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability was caused by Argo CD exposing secret values in error messages and the diff view when syncing an invalid Kubernetes Secret resource from a repository.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
Exposure of secret values in error messages and diff views during sync of invalid Kubernetes Secrets.

Impact of exploitation:
Any user with read access to Argo CD can view the exposed secret data if an attacker with write access to the repository commits an invalid Secret.

Attack vectors:
An attacker with write access to the repository commits an invalid Secret, triggering a Sync operation.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
Write access to the repository.

Mitigation or fix:
Upgrade to Argo CD versions v2.13.4, v2.12.10, or v2.11.13. The vulnerability was fixed with commits [6f5537b](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/commit/6f5537bdf15ddbaa0f27a1a678632ff0743e4107) and [argoproj/gitops-engine@7e21b91](https://github.com/argoproj/gitops-engine/commit/7e21b91e9d0f64104c8a661f3f390c5e6d73ddca).
