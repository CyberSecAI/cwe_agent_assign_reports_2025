# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-3031
## Query
The Fluid Notification Bar plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via admin settings in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: 'insufficient input sanitization', 'output escaping'
- **weakness**: 'cross-site scripting'
