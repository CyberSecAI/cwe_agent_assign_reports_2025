# Retrieval Query for CVE-2024-42455

# Vulnerability Description

    A vulnerability in Veeam Backup & Replication allows a low-privileged user to connect to remoting services and exploit **insecure deserialization** by sending a serialized temporary file collection. This exploit allows the attacker to delete any file on the system with service account privileges. The vulnerability is caused by an **insufficient blacklist** during the deserialization process.

    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis
