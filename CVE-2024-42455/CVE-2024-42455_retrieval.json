This could lead to data loss, system instability, and potentially denial of service.\\n\\n**Attack Vectors:**\\n- Network-based: The attacker exploits this vulnerability by connecting to remote services.\\n- Exploitation of insecure deserialization.\\n- Sending a maliciously crafted serialized temporary file collection.\\n\\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\\n- Authenticated access: The attacker needs valid credentials for an account with a role assigned in the \"Users and Roles\" settings of the Veeam Backup & Replication server.\\n- Network access: The attacker needs to be able to connect to remote services from the affected system.\\n\\n**Summary:**\\nCVE-2024-42455 describes a vulnerability in Veeam Backup & Replication where an authenticated user, with specific roles assigned, can exploit insecure deserialization via remote services to delete arbitrary files on the system.', similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats':
