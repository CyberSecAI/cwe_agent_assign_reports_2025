  "description": "An **arbitrary file deletion** vulnerability exists in danny-avila/librechat version v0.7.5-rc2, specifically within the /api/files endpoint. This vulnerability arises from **improper input validation**, allowing **path traversal** techniques to delete arbitrary files on the server. Attackers can exploit this to bypass security mechanisms and delete files outside the intended directory, including critical system files, user data, or application resources. This vulnerability impacts the integrity and availability of the system.",

  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2024-10361 Content\n\nThe provided content relates to a commit in the LibreChat repository addressing avatar handling for agents and assistants. It appears to fix a vulnerability where the avatar metadata was being parsed from the request body instead of being fetched from the agent/assistant object.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe code was parsing avatar metadata directly from the request body, which is insecure and could potentially allow an attacker to manipulate the avatar data.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **Insecure Deserialization:** Parsing data directly from the request body without proper validation can lead to insecure deserialization vulnerabilities.\n*   **Potential for Arbitrary File Upload/Modification:** If the parsed metadata contained file paths or other sensitive information, it could potentially be exploited to upload or modify files on the server.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nThe impact of exploitation is not explicitly stated, but it could potentially lead to:\n\n*   **Arbitrary File Upload:** An attacker could potentially upload malicious files to the server.\n*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially access sensitive information about the agent or assistant.\n*   **Denial of Service:** An attacker could potentially cause a denial of service by uploading a large or malicious file.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   An attacker could send a crafted request with malicious avatar metadata in the request body.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the `/avatar/:agent_id` or `/avatar/:assistant_id` endpoints.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\nThe commit fixes the vulnerability by:\n\n*   Removing the parsing of avatar metadata from the request body.\n*   Fetching the avatar data from the agent/assistant object using the agent/assistant ID.\n*   Updating the deleteFileByFilter function to include the user ID when deleting the old avatar file.\n*   Updating error logging to provide more informative messages.\n\n**More detail than official CVE description:**\n\nYes, the content provides significantly more detail than a typical CVE description. It includes specific code changes, the root cause of the vulnerability, and the mitigation steps taken to fix it. It also details the specific files modified and the lines of code changed.",

This leads to a **path traversal** vulnerability that allows **arbitrary file deletion**. CWE-20 is a more general class of weakness, and while applicable, CWE-22 provides a more specific description of the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe36[\"CWE-36: Absolute Path Traversal\"]\n    \n    cwe22 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    cwe36 -->|CHILDOF| cwe22\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe22 primary\n    class cwe20 secondary\n    class cwe36 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with **improper input validation** (CWE-20), which allows for **path traversal** (CWE-22). This ultimately results in **arbitrary file deletion**, impacting the integrity and availability of the system.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE selected is CWE-22 because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions **path traversal** leading to arbitrary file deletion. The root cause is **improper input validation**, making CWE-20 a relevant secondary consideration. The high retriever scores for CWE-22, along with the specific mention of **path traversal**, strongly support this classification. The evidence provided clearly points to a failure in properly limiting pathnames to a restricted directory, enabling attackers to delete arbitrary files.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
