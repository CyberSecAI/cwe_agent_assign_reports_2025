  "description": "The Tourfic Ultimate Hotel Booking, Travel Booking & Apartment Booking WordPress Plugin | WooCommerce Booking plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the enquiry_id parameter of the tf_enquiry_reply_email_callback function in all versions up to, and including, 2.15.3 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n\n*   The vulnerability lies in the `tf_enquiry_reply_email_callback` function of the Tourfic WordPress plugin. Specifically, the `enquiry_id` parameter, which is user-supplied, is not properly sanitized before being used in a SQL query. The SQL query also lacks sufficient preparation.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **SQL Injection:**  The lack of input sanitization and prepared statements makes the plugin vulnerable to SQL injection. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code via the `enquiry_id` parameter.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Sensitive Data Extraction:** An attacker can leverage the SQL injection vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the database. This could include user data, plugin settings, or other sensitive details.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over the network.\n*   **HTTP Request:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable endpoint (`wp_ajax_tf_enquiry_reply_email`).\n*  **Parameter Manipulation:** The attack vector utilizes the `enquiry_id` parameter within the request.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user with at least \"Subscriber\" level access (or higher).\n*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the WordPress site.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n*   The vulnerability exists in all versions of the Tourfic plugin up to and including 2.15.3.\n*   The vulnerability is fixed in version 2.15.4.\n*   The Wordfence article provides a CVSS score of 6.5 (Medium)\n*   The provided content includes links to the relevant files in the plugin's repository where the vulnerability exists, and where it has been patched.\n*   The provided content includes details on how to mitigate the vulnerability, by upgrading the plugin to 2.15.4 or greater.",

The vulnerability is caused by **insufficient escaping** of user-supplied parameters and **lack of sufficient preparation** on the existing SQL query.|\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-89, which is a base level CWE. There are no direct parent-child or chain relationships significantly impacting this decision. The retriever results strongly suggest CWE-89, and the vulnerability description clearly indicates an SQL Injection issue due to **insufficient escaping** and **lack of sufficient preparation** in the SQL query.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe89 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **insufficient escaping** of the user-supplied parameter `enquiry_id` and the **lack of sufficient preparation** on the existing SQL query. This leads to the **SQL Injection** (CWE-89), which allows authenticated attackers to extract sensitive information from the database.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description, which clearly states that the vulnerability is due to **insufficient escaping** and **lack of sufficient preparation** leading to **SQL Injection**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this by highlighting the lack of input sanitization and prepared statements. The retriever results also strongly suggest CWE-89 as the primary CWE. The graph relationships are simple, as CWE-89 is a base CWE. The selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly represents the root cause of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.\n\n*Not Selected*: While CSRF might be a concern in web applications, it's not the primary issue described in this vulnerability.
