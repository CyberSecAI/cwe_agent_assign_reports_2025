The key phrase \"information disclosure\" is the strongest indicator.\n\nGiven the limited information, I'm choosing CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere as the primary CWE. This is because the vulnerability description states that manipulation leads to information disclosure. This aligns with CWE-497's description, \"The product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\"\n\nThe confidence is relatively low (0.7) because the description is vague and lacks specific details about how the information disclosure occurs. There is also no \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" to confirm the rootcause.\n\nOther CWEs Considered:\n\n*   CWE-89 (SQL Injection), CWE-79 (Cross-Site Scripting), CWE-434 (Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type), CWE-352 (Cross-Site Request Forgery): These CWEs are related to web application vulnerabilities, but they do not directly describe the **impact** of information disclosure.\n*   CWE-425 (Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')): This could be a contributing factor, but the primary **impact** is information disclosure, making CWE-497 more relevant.",
