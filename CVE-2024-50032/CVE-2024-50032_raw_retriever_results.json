  "query": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved rcu/nocb Fix rcuog wake-up from offline softirq After a CPU has set itself offline and before it eventually calls rcutree_report_cpu_dead(), there are still opportunities for callbacks to be enqueued, for example from a softirq. When that happens on NOCB, the rcuog wake-up is deferred through an IPI to an online CPU in order not to call into the scheduler and risk arming the RT-bandwidth after hrtimers have been migrated out and disabled. But performing a synchronized IPI from a softirq is buggy as reported in the following scenario WARNING CPU 1 PID 26 at kernel/smp.c633 smp_call_function_single Modules linked in rcutorture torture CPU 1 UID 0 PID 26 Comm migration/1 Not tainted 6.11.0-rc1-00012-g9139f93209d1 #1 Stopper multi_cpu_stop+0x0/0x320 swake_up_one_online __call_rcu_nocb_wake __call_rcu_common ? rcu_torture_one_read call_timer_fn __run_timers run_timer_softirq handle_softirqs irq_exit_rcu ? tick_handle_periodic sysvec_apic_timer_interrupt Fix this with forcing deferred rcuog wake up through the NOCB timer when the CPU is offline. The actual wake up will happen from rcutree_report_cpu_dead().",
