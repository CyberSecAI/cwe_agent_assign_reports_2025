  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved rcu/nocb Fix rcuog wake-up from offline softirq After a CPU has set itself offline and before it eventually calls rcutree_report_cpu_dead(), there are still opportunities for callbacks to be enqueued, for example from a softirq. When that happens on NOCB, the rcuog wake-up is deferred through an IPI to an online CPU in order not to call into the scheduler and risk arming the RT-bandwidth after hrtimers have been migrated out and disabled. But performing a synchronized IPI from a softirq is buggy as reported in the following scenario WARNING CPU 1 PID 26 at kernel/smp.c633 smp_call_function_single Modules linked in rcutorture torture CPU 1 UID 0 PID 26 Comm migration/1 Not tainted 6.11.0-rc1-00012-g9139f93209d1 #1 Stopper multi_cpu_stop+0x0/0x320 swake_up_one_online __call_rcu_nocb_wake __call_rcu_common ? rcu_torture_one_read call_timer_fn __run_timers run_timer_softirq handle_softirqs irq_exit_rcu ? tick_handle_periodic sysvec_apic_timer_interrupt Fix this with forcing deferred rcuog wake up through the NOCB timer when the CPU is offline.

  "reference_content": "The provided content relates to a fix for a race condition in the Linux kernel's RCU (Read-Copy-Update) subsystem, specifically within the non-callback (NOCB) implementation. This fix addresses a scenario where a CPU is in the process of going offline but still has pending RCU callbacks, leading to a buggy IPI (Inter-Processor Interrupt).\n\nHere's a breakdown:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\n-   When a CPU is being taken offline, there's a window where RCU callbacks can still be enqueued (e.g., from a softirq).\n-   In the NOCB implementation, these callbacks trigger an RCU grace period wake-up. This wake-up is deferred to an online CPU via IPI to avoid scheduler calls.\n-   The issue arises because performing a synchronized IPI from a softirq during the CPU offline procedure is unsafe and can lead to a kernel warning and likely a crash.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n-   **Race Condition:** The primary vulnerability is a race condition between the CPU going offline and the enqueueing of RCU callbacks.\n-   **Incorrect IPI Usage:** Attempting to send a synchronized IPI from within a softirq context during CPU offline is inherently unsafe.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n-   Kernel crash, as evidenced by the warning output\n-   System instability due to the buggy IPI within a softirq\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n-   The vulnerability is triggered by the normal process of taking a CPU offline while RCU callbacks are pending. Thus this is not a classic attack vector from an external attacker, but a flaw that arises during normal system operation, especially in scenarios involving CPU hotplug.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n-   An attacker would not necessarily need to be in a special position to trigger this bug, as it arises during the process of taking a cpu offline while RCU callbacks are pending and is not dependent on user interaction, therefore this could be triggered unintentionally during normal operation.\n\n**Fix:**\n\nThe fix changes the behavior of `__call_rcu_nocb_wake`:\n\n-  Instead of sending the IPI to an online CPU immediately from the softirq, it forces a deferred RCU wake up through the NOCB timer.\n-  The actual wake-up now happens from `rcutree_report_cpu_dead()`, which is called after the CPU is completely offline, ensuring that the IPI doesn't occur in the unsafe softirq context.\n\n**Additional Details**\n- The commit message references the following bug report: https://lore.kernel.org/oe-lkp/202409231644.4c55582d-lkp@intel.com\n- The fix addresses an issue first introduced by commit `9139f93209d1` (\"rcu/nocb: Fix RT throttling hrtimer armed from offline CPU\")\n- The changes are localized to the `kernel/rcu/tree_nocb.h` file.\n\nIn summary, this patch fixes a race condition that leads to a buggy IPI when a CPU goes offline, preventing a kernel crash. It's a fix for an internal race condition not an externally exploitable vulnerability in the traditional sense.",

This is a Class-level CWE. CWE-667, \"Improper Locking,\" and CWE-367, \"Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\" are related to CWE-362. CWE-667 is a class level weakness. CWE-367 is a base level weakness and a more specific type of **race condition**, involving a check and subsequent use of a resource where the state can change in between. Although CWE-367 is more specific, the description provided is more general to **improper synchronization** and doesn't perfectly fit the TOCTOU scenario, I am choosing to use the higher level Class CWE-362.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    cwe667[\"CWE-667: Improper Locking\"]\n    cwe367[\"CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\"]\n    \n    cwe667 -->|CHILDOF| cwe362\n    cwe367 -->|CHILDOF| cwe362\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe362 primary\n    class cwe667,cwe367 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper synchronization** (CWE-362) when a CPU is being taken offline and RCU callbacks are enqueued. This leads to a race condition where an unsafe IPI is triggered from a softirq context, potentially resulting in a kernel crash.\n  - The root cause is the **improper synchronization** during the CPU offline process.\n  - The consequence is the attempt to send a synchronized IPI from within a softirq, which is unsafe.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The evidence clearly points to a **race condition** due to **improper synchronization** (CWE-362) during the CPU offline procedure. The retriever results and vulnerability descriptions support this classification. While CWE-367 (TOCTOU) is a related, more specific type of **race condition**, the general nature of the **improper synchronization** makes CWE-362 a better fit. The graph relationships highlight the connections between these CWEs, with CWE-367 being a child of CWE-362, but I opted for the higher level Class due to the more general description of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*This was added as a secondary CWE.*\n\n## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*This was added as the primary CWE.*\n\n## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check.
