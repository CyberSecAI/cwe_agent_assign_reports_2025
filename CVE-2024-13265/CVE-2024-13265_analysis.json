CWE-96, a potential secondary CWE, is a parent of CWE-95, and a child of CWE-94. These relationships highlight a potential vulnerability chain involving code injection and improper neutralization. The chosen CWEs are at the Base and Variant levels, providing a good balance between specificity and generality.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe98[\"CWE-98: Improper Control of Filename for Include/Require Statement in PHP Program ('PHP Remote File Inclusion')\"]\n    cwe96[\"CWE-96: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Statically Saved Code ('Static Code Injection')\"]\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n\n    cwe98 -->|CHILDOF| cwe94\n    cwe96 -->|CHILDOF| cwe94\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe98 primary\n    class cwe96 secondary\n    class cwe94 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **Improper Neutralization of Directives in Statically Saved Code** (CWE-96). This can lead to **Improper Control of Filename for Include/Require Statement in PHP Program** (CWE-98), resulting in PHP Local File Inclusion. The root cause is the lack of proper neutralization, which allows an attacker to control the included file.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-98, as it directly relates to the \"PHP Local File Inclusion\" vulnerability mentioned in the description. The vulnerability description explicitly states \"**Improper Neutralization of Directives in Statically Saved Code** (Static Code Injection)\" as a vulnerability. CWE-96 is also listed as a potential weakness, which may contribute to the overall vulnerability, but is not the direct cause of the local file inclusion.\n\nThe evidence for CWE-98 is that it is the top retriever result and that the vulnerability results in a local file inclusion.\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-96: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Statically Saved Code ('Static Code Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes code syntax before inserting the input into an executable resource, such as a library, configuration file, or template.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-98: Improper Control of Filename for Include/Require Statement in PHP Program ('PHP Remote File Inclusion')\n**Abstraction Level**: variant\n**Similarity Score**: 3.24\n**Source**: graph\n\n**Description**:\nCWE-98: Improper Control of Filename for Include/Require Statement in PHP Program ('PHP Remote File Inclusion')\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.",
