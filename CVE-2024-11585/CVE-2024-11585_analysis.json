  "description": "The WP Hide & Security Enhancer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file contents deletion due to a **missing authorization and insufficient file path validation** in the file-process.php in all versions up to, and including, 2.5.1. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete the contents of arbitrary files on the server, which can break the site or lead to data loss.",

  "reference_content": "**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability stems from missing authorization and insufficient file path validation in the `file-process.php` file. This allows unauthenticated users to trigger file operations.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- Missing Authorization: There is no check to verify if the user is authorized to perform the requested file operations.\n- Insufficient Path Validation: Although there's a regex to filter the filepath, it's insufficient to prevent path traversal.\n- Arbitrary File Contents Deletion: The combination of the above weaknesses allows arbitrary file content deletion.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- Arbitrary File Content Deletion: Attackers can delete the contents of arbitrary files on the server.\n- Site disruption/data loss: This can lead to site breakage, data loss and denial of service.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- Unauthenticated users can send requests to the vulnerable `file-process.php` file using GET parameters. The parameters include `action`, `file_path`, and `replacement_path`.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.\n- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable endpoint.",

It indicates the absence of an authorization check, allowing unauthorized access to functionality. The secondary weakness is **CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')**, a Base-level CWE. This allows for deletion of arbitrary files. **CWE-862** is related to **CWE-284 Improper Access Control** (Pillar) as **CWE-862** is a more specific type of access control issue. **CWE-22** can lead to **CWE-73 External Control of File Name or Path**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe73[\"CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe22 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe73\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe22 secondary\n    class cwe284,cwe73 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **CWE-862 Missing Authorization**, allowing unauthenticated users to access the file deletion functionality.

The secondary CWE, **CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')**, is included because the insufficient path validation allows attackers to delete files outside the intended directory. Both CWEs are at the appropriate level of specificity, with **CWE-862** being a Class and **CWE-22** being a Base.\n\nOther CWEs considered but not used:\n\n*   CWE-284: Improper Access Control - This is a high-level category.
