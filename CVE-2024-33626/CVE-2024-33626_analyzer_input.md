Disclosure of this information could enable attackers to connect to the devices WiFi network.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** unauthenticated disclosure of sensitive information
- **vector:** hidden page accessible by an HTTP request
- **product:** LevelOne WBR-6012
- **component:** web application

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is the presence of a hidden web page (`sysinfo.htm`) within the LevelOne WBR-6012 router's web application that exposes sensitive information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Information Exposure:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of sensitive data, specifically the WiFi WPS PIN, through the `sysinfo.htm` page. This page is accessible without authentication.
- **Lack of Access Control:** The web application fails to restrict access to the `sysinfo.htm` page, allowing unauthenticated users to view its contents.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized WiFi Access:** The disclosed WiFi WPS PIN allows an attacker to connect to the device's WiFi network without authorization. This could lead to various malicious activities, including network eavesdropping, data theft, and launching further attacks within the network.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending an HTTP request to the `sysinfo.htm` page. No special tools or techniques are required to initiate this request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Accessibility:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable router. This could mean being on the same local network as the router or potentially accessing it remotely if the router's web interface is exposed to the internet.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any credentials to access the vulnerable `sysinfo.htm` page.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in LevelOne WBR-6012 R0.40e6.
- The CVSSv3 score is 5.3, indicating a medium severity vulnerability.
- The CWE is CWE-200, which categorizes this as an Information Exposure vulnerability.
