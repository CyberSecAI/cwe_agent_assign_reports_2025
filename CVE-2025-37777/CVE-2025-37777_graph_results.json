  "query": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ksmbd fix use-after-free in __smb2_lease_break_noti() Move tcp_transport free to ksmbd_conn_free. If ksmbd connection is referenced when ksmbd server thread terminates, It will not be freed, but conn->tcp_transport is freed. __smb2_lease_break_noti can be performed asynchronously when the connection is disconnected. __smb2_lease_break_noti calls ksmbd_conn_write, which can cause use-after-free when conn->ksmbd_transport is already freed.",
