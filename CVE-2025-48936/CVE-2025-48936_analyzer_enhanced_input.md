## Vulnerability Description
Zitadel is open-source identity infrastructure software. Prior to versions 2.70.12, 2.71.10, and 3.2.2, a potential vulnerability exists in the password reset mechanism. ZITADEL utilizes the Forwarded or X-Forwarded-Host header from incoming requests to construct the URL for the password reset confirmation link. This link, containing a secret code, is then emailed to the user. If an attacker can manipulate these headers (e.g., via **host header injection**), they could cause ZITADEL to generate a password reset link pointing to a malicious domain controlled by the attacker. If the user clicks this manipulated link in the email, the secret reset code embedded in the URL can be captured by the attacker. This captured code could then be used to reset the users password and gain unauthorized access to their account. This specific attack vector is mitigated for accounts that have Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) or Passwordless authentication enabled. This issue has been patched in versions 2.70.12, 2.71.10, and 3.2.2.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-48936 based on provided content

The provided content is **RELEVANT** to CVE-2025-48936. It details a vulnerability in ZITADEL related to account takeover via manipulation of the `X-Forwarded-Proto` header. Here's a breakdown of the information extracted:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

ZITADEL uses the `Forwarded` or `X-Forwarded-Host` header from incoming requests to construct the URL for password reset confirmation links. An attacker can manipulate these headers to point the link to a malicious domain.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Host Header Injection:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of the `X-Forwarded-Proto` and `Forwarded` headers.
*   **Insecure URL Generation:**  The password reset link is generated using potentially attacker-controlled header values.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Account Takeover:** If a user clicks the manipulated link, the attacker can capture the secret reset code and use it to reset the user's password, gaining unauthorized access to their account.
*   **Mitigation for MFA/Passwordless:** Accounts with Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) or Passwordless authentication enabled are not vulnerable.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Header Manipulation:** An attacker needs to be able to manipulate the `X-Forwarded-Proto` and `Forwarded` headers in requests to ZITADEL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the ZITADEL server with modified headers. This could be achieved through various means, depending on the deployment environment.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   **Update ZITADEL:** Upgrade to patched versions: 3.2.2 or 2.70.12/2.71.11.
*   **Proxy Configuration:** Configure a fronting proxy to delete all `Forwarded` and `X-Forwarded-Host` header values before sending requests to ZITADEL.
*   **Header Validation:** The patched versions ensure proper validation of the headers and prevent downgrading from `https` to `http`.
*   **Enforce HTTPS:** The commit c097887 explicitly enforces HTTPS, preventing the overwrite to HTTP.

**Additional Details (compared to a hypothetical CVE description):**

*   The content provides specific version numbers affected and patched.
*   It details the technical implementation of the fix (header validation and HTTPS enforcement).
*   It explains the workaround using a proxy.
*   It includes CVSS scoring information (8.1/10) and a breakdown of the CVSS v3 base metrics.
*   It credits the researcher who discovered the vulnerability (Amit Laish).
*   The commit message provides further context on how the vulnerability works and how the fix addresses it.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control

**Authentication**:
Determines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.

* Example phrases: "user must log in", "lack of login check", "bypasses login"
* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.

  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* – used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).

**Authorization**:
Determines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do. It decides access *after* identity is verified.

* Example phrases: "unauthorized access", "regular user can access admin panel", "role checks are missing"
* CWE relevance: use CWEs like 862, 863, 285 for authorization errors:

  * **CWE-862**: *Missing Authorization* – the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all.
  * **CWE-863**: *Incorrect Authorization* – the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).
  * **CWE-285**: *Improper Authorization* – general category for any flawed authorization logic or design.

**Access Control**:
A broader term that includes both authentication and authorization. Governs how resources are protected and who can access them under what conditions.

* CWE relevance:

  * **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* – top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear.
  * This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.

## Mapping Discussion – Common Misclassification Patterns

### 1. **CWE-306 vs CWE-862**:

* **306** is about lack of **authentication** (e.g., *no login required at all*).
* **862** is about lack of **authorization** *after* authentication (e.g., *admin check missing*).
* ✅ Example CWE-306: *“An unauthenticated attacker can invoke the password reset API.”*
* ✅ Example CWE-862: *“An authenticated user without admin privileges can delete any user account.”*

### 2. **CWE-285 vs CWE-284**:

* **285** is specific to authorization flaws – it's a better choice than 284 **if** the issue involves *improper or missing role checks*.
* **284** should be reserved for general access control issues when it’s unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.

---

## Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification

**Phrase like "unauthorized access" is not enough.**

* If you **cannot determine whether identity was checked**, assume it’s **authorization** and consider 862 or 863.
* If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** → CWE-306.
* If the **access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced**, but it's not due to missing checks, consider **CWE-284**.

---

## Good Mapping Examples

* ✅ **CWE-306**: “The endpoint `/admin/deleteUser` does not require any authentication.”
* ✅ **CWE-862**: “Any logged-in user can change any other user's email without being an admin.”
* ✅ **CWE-863**: “An admin check exists but incorrectly grants access to non-admin users.”
* ✅ **CWE-285**: “Application uses a static role check that fails when roles change dynamically.”
* ✅ **CWE-284**: “Inconsistent enforcement of access rules across services with unclear policy source.”
