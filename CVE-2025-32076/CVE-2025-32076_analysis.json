  "reference_content": "## CVE-2025-32076 Analysis\n\nThis content is directly related to CVE-2025-32076. It provides detailed information about the vulnerability.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability lies in a regular expression `/<\\s\\*([^<>]+)\\s\\*>/` used to process user-provided data in the `SubmitForm` function within the VisualData extension. This regex has a third-degree polynomial complexity, making it susceptible to Regular Expression Denial-of-Service (ReDoS) attacks.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS):** The vulnerable regex can cause excessive CPU consumption when processing crafted input, leading to a denial of service.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can craft malicious input that causes the server to spend excessive time processing the regex, potentially leading to a denial of service.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Providing specially crafted input containing malicious patterns that exploit the regex's complexity.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   An attacker needs to be able to provide user-controlled data that is processed by the vulnerable regex.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   The regex was initially proposed to be fixed with a non-greedy quantifier: `/<\\s*([^<>]+?)\\s*>/`. However, this was deemed insufficient.\n*   The fix implemented was `/<\\s\\*+([^<>]++)\\s\\*+>/`.\n*   A separate bug was filed to address the same regex being used in `replaceFormula`.\n*   The fix was applied in the following commits:\n    *   [https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/plugins/gitiles/mediawiki/extensions/VisualData/+/fc7c0257b7d7c11f11bd750ee1225854b02ea9f5](https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/plugins/gitiles/mediawiki/extensions/VisualData/%2B/fc7c0257b7d7c11f11bd750ee1225854b02ea9f5)\n    *   [https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/plugins/gitiles/mediawiki/extensions/VisualData/+/2b7094da7bba630fb142690379fa7049b8f1edb5%5E%21/](https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/plugins/gitiles/mediawiki/extensions/VisualData/%2B/2b7094da7bba630fb142690379fa7049b8f1edb5%5E%21/)\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   The vulnerability affects the VisualData extension.\n*   The issue was initially reported by R4356th.\n*   The fix was tested and confirmed by Thomas-topway-it and Brian (Bawolff).\n*   The vulnerability is tagged with `Vuln-DoS` and `Security`.\n*   The issue affects Miraheze.\n*   There was discussion about reporting the bug on the public Talk page versus Phabricator.\n*   The use of possessive quantifiers (`++`) was discussed as part of the fix.\n*   A related issue exists in the `replaceFormula` function.",

We also considered chain relationships, specifically how **improper input validation** can lead to a denial-of-service through uncontrolled recursion. The Class level of CWE-20 was deemed appropriate as no more specific Base or Variant CWEs fully captured the vulnerability's nature.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe674[\"CWE-674: Uncontrolled Recursion\"]\n    \n    cwe674 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe20\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe20 primary\n    class cwe674 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper input validation** (CWE-20), which allows a malicious actor to send crafted input that leads to uncontrolled recursion (CWE-674), eventually causing a denial-of-service (DoS).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly suggests CWE-20 as the primary weakness due to the explicit mention of \"**Input Validation vulnerability**\" in the description. This is further reinforced by the keyphrase analysis that identifies CWE-20 as the most relevant CWE for both \"Input Validation vulnerability\" and \"Improper Input Validation\". The impact of the vulnerability is an HTTP DoS, which is a consequence of **improper input validation**. While several CWEs are related to DoS, CWE-674 (Uncontrolled Recursion) is chosen as a secondary CWE because it describes a specific mechanism that could lead to a DoS, given the **improper input validation**.\n\nThe selection of CWE-20 is based on the clear statement in the vulnerability description regarding **input validation**. The retriever results also consistently rank CWE-20 as the top match. The relationship analysis highlights that while there are more specific child CWEs of CWE-20, none precisely capture the described vulnerability, making CWE-20 the most appropriate choice at its class level.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
