Relevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:

### 1. CWE-20: Improper Input Validation (Score: 152.79)

The product receives input or data, but it does
        not validate or incorrectly validates that the input has the
        properties that are required to process the data safely and
        correctly....

### 2. CWE-451: User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information (Score: 146.52)

The product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties....

### 5. CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter (Score: 126.79)

The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields....

## IMPACT: 'HTTP DoS'

Relevant CWEs for this IMPACT:

### 1. CWE-20: Improper Input Validation (Score: 152.79)

The product receives input or data, but it does
        not validate or incorrectly validates that the input has the
        properties that are required to process the data safely and
        correctly....

### 2. CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow (Score: 47.33)

A stack-based buffer overflow condition is a condition where the buffer being overwritten is allocated on the stack (i.e., is a local variable or, rarely, a parameter to a function)....
