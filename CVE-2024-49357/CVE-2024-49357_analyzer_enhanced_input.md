## Vulnerability Description
ZimaOS is a fork of CasaOS, an operating system for Zima devices and x86-64 systems with UEFI. In version 1.2.4 and all prior versions, the API endpoints in ZimaOS, such as `http///v1/users/image?path=/var/lib/casaos/1/app_order.json` and `http///v1/users/image?path=/var/lib/casaos/1/system.json`, expose sensitive data like installed applications and system information without requiring any authentication or authorization. This sensitive data leak can be exploited by attackers to gain detailed knowledge about the system setup, installed applications, and other critical information. As of time of publication, no known patched versions are available.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **no authentication or authorization**
- **impact:** data leak and expose sensitive data
- **attacker:** attackers
- **product:** ZimaOS
- **version:** 1.2.4 and all prior versions
- **component:** API endpoints

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is the lack of authentication and authorization checks on API endpoints that expose sensitive system information and installed application data. Specifically, the `/v1/users/image` endpoint allows access to files like `app_order.json` and `system.json` without requiring any form of authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Insecure Direct Object Reference:** The API directly exposes file paths without access control.
- **Missing Authentication:** No authentication is required to access the sensitive endpoints.
- **Missing Authorization:** No authorization checks are performed to limit access based on user roles or permissions.
- **Information Exposure:** Sensitive files like `app_order.json` and `system.json` are directly accessible to unauthorized users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Attackers can gain access to detailed information about the system, including installed applications, OS version, hostname, CPU info, and memory.
- **System Profiling:**  Attackers can use this information to profile the system, understand its configuration, and identify potential vulnerabilities.
- **Targeted Attacks:** The gathered information enables attackers to craft specific and more effective attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** The vulnerability is exposed through network accessible API endpoints, namely `http://<Server-IP>/v1/users/image?path=/var/lib/casaos/1/app_order.json` and `http://<Server-IP>/v1/users/image?path=/var/lib/casaos/1/system.json`.
- **Remote Access:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely by sending GET requests to the specified endpoints

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server running the vulnerable ZimaOS.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any credentials to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP GET requests.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) clearly demonstrates how to exploit the vulnerability by sending GET requests to the unauthenticated endpoints.
- Example responses from the API are included, illustrating the type of sensitive data exposed.
- The vulnerability is rated as high severity due to the ease of exploitation and the sensitivity of the leaked information.
- The affected versions include ZimaOS versions up to v1.2.4, with version 1.2.5 addressing the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is classified under CWE-200: Information Exposure.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control

**Authentication**:
Determines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.

* Example phrases: "user must log in", "lack of login check", "bypasses login"
* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.

  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* – used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).

**Authorization**:
Determines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do. It decides access *after* identity is verified.

* Example phrases: "unauthorized access", "regular user can access admin panel", "role checks are missing"
* CWE relevance: use CWEs like 862, 863, 285 for authorization errors:

  * **CWE-862**: *Missing Authorization* – the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all.
  * **CWE-863**: *Incorrect Authorization* – the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).
  * **CWE-285**: *Improper Authorization* – general category for any flawed authorization logic or design.

**Access Control**:
A broader term that includes both authentication and authorization. Governs how resources are protected and who can access them under what conditions.

* CWE relevance:

  * **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* – top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear.
  * This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.

## Mapping Discussion – Common Misclassification Patterns

### 1. **CWE-306 vs CWE-862**:

* **306** is about lack of **authentication** (e.g., *no login required at all*).
* **862** is about lack of **authorization** *after* authentication (e.g., *admin check missing*).
* ✅ Example CWE-306: *“An unauthenticated attacker can invoke the password reset API.”*
* ✅ Example CWE-862: *“An authenticated user without admin privileges can delete any user account.”*

### 2. **CWE-285 vs CWE-284**:

* **285** is specific to authorization flaws – it's a better choice than 284 **if** the issue involves *improper or missing role checks*.
* **284** should be reserved for general access control issues when it’s unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.

---

## Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification

**Phrase like "unauthorized access" is not enough.**

* If you **cannot determine whether identity was checked**, assume it’s **authorization** and consider 862 or 863.
* If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** → CWE-306.
* If the **access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced**, but it's not due to missing checks, consider **CWE-284**.

---

## Good Mapping Examples

* ✅ **CWE-306**: “The endpoint `/admin/deleteUser` does not require any authentication.”
* ✅ **CWE-862**: “Any logged-in user can change any other user's email without being an admin.”
* ✅ **CWE-863**: “An admin check exists but incorrectly grants access to non-admin users.”
* ✅ **CWE-285**: “Application uses a static role check that fails when roles change dynamically.”
* ✅ **CWE-284**: “Inconsistent enforcement of access rules across services with unclear policy source.”

| No role/privilege check after login                        | CWE-862        |
| Role check is present but flawed                           | CWE-863        |
| General or ambiguous authorization failure                 | CWE-285        |
