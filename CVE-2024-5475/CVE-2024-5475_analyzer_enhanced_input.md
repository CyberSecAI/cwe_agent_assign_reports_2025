## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the plugin's failure to properly sanitize and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them within a page or post. This lack of input validation allows for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary weakness is the presence of a stored XSS vulnerability. Malicious scripts are embedded within the shortcode and stored in the database, triggering when the page/post is viewed by other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser. This can lead to various malicious actions, such as:
    - **Session Hijacking:** Stealing user cookies and session tokens.
    - **Account Takeover:** Gaining unauthorized access to user accounts.
    - **Data Theft:** Exfiltrating sensitive information.
    - **Malware Distribution:** Redirecting users to malicious websites or downloading malware.
    - **Defacement:** Altering the appearance of the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Shortcode Injection:** The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code using a crafted shortcode attribute. In this case, the `src` attribute of the `[rve]` shortcode is the injection point.
- **Stored XSS Trigger:** When a user views a post or page containing the crafted shortcode, the embedded script executes in their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Contributor Role or Higher:** An attacker must have at least the "Contributor" role in WordPress. This allows them to create or edit posts and embed shortcodes.
- **No User Interaction Required (after initial injection):** The XSS payload is stored and will execute when a user visits the affected page, meaning no further interaction is required from the attacker for the exploit to trigger

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable plugin is "Responsive Video Embed" versions prior to 0.5.1
- The provided Proof of Concept demonstrates the attack vector and the simplicity of the exploit
- The vulnerability is classified as CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting'))
- The CVSS score is 5.9 (Medium), which is calculated based on the attack complexity, privilege required, scope, confidentiality, integrity and availability impact.

This information is more detailed than a typical CVE description, which usually only provides a high-level overview of the vulnerability.
