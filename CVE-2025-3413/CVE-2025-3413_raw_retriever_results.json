Affected by this vulnerability is the function code of the file SysGeneratorController.java. The manipulation of the argument Tables leads to deserialization. The attack can be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. This product does not use versioning. This is why information about affected and unaffected releases are unavailable. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",
