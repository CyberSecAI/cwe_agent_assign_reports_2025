  "description": "An issue was discovered in za-internet C-MOR Video Surveillance 5.2401. Due to **improper or missing access control**, low privileged users can use administrative functions of the C-MOR web interface. It was found out that different functions are only available to administrative users. However, access those functions is restricted via the web application user interface and not checked on the server side. Thus, by sending corresponding HTTP requests to the web server of the C-MOR web interface, low privileged users can also use administrative functionality, for instance downloading backup files or changing configuration settings.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from improper or missing access control in the C-MOR web interface. The application relies on the user interface for access restrictions instead of server-side checks.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n*   **Improper Access Control (CWE-284):** Low-privileged users can bypass UI restrictions and access administrative functions by directly sending HTTP requests to the server.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n*   Low-privileged users can perform actions intended for administrators.\n*   Specifically, the provided PoC demonstrates downloading backup files.\n*   The advisory mentions the potential for changing configuration settings as well.\n*   This could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and system compromise.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n*   **Direct HTTP Requests:** Attackers bypass the web UI by crafting and sending HTTP requests directly to the server. This allows them to access restricted functionalities.\n*   **HTML Forms/Curl Commands:** Attackers can use HTML forms or command-line tools like `curl` to send the crafted requests, making it relatively easy to exploit.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n*   **Low-Privilege User Account:** The attacker needs a valid, albeit low-privileged, user account on the C-MOR system.\n*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the C-MOR web interface.\n*   **Understanding of HTTP Requests:** The attacker should understand how to craft and send HTTP POST requests.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n*   The advisory provides a specific example of downloading backup files using a POST request to `download-bkf.pml`.\n*   The vulnerability was reported to the manufacturer on 2024-04-05 and fixed on 2024-07-31 with the release of version 6.00PL1.\n*   The vulnerability is present in C-MOR Video Surveillance version 5.2401.\n*   The advisory was publicly disclosed on 2024-09-04.\n*   The advisory was given ID SYSS-2024-024",

While the vulnerability description mentions \"**improper or missing access control**,\" the key issue is the lack of authorization checks on the server side, which falls under CWE-862. CWE-284 is a more general term and is discouraged when a more specific CWE is applicable.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe284 secondary\n```\n\nNote: The Mermaid diagram should be enclosed in triple backticks with \"mermaid\" as the language specifier, but do NOT use \"markdown\" as a language specifier anywhere in your response.\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authorization** check on the server side (CWE-862). This allows low-privileged users to bypass the UI restrictions and directly access administrative functions by sending HTTP requests. The impact is the ability to download backup files and change configuration settings, leading to unauthorized access and potential data breaches.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the \"**improper or missing access control**\" aspect of the vulnerability. However, after reviewing the CWE specifications and the mapping guidance, it became clear that the root cause is the **missing authorization** check (CWE-862) on the server side. The vulnerability description explicitly states that the access restrictions are only enforced on the web application user interface and not checked on the server side. This allows low-privileged users to bypass the UI and directly access administrative functions.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the final selection by highlighting the parent-child relationship between CWE-284 and CWE-862. Since the vulnerability description clearly indicates a **missing authorization** check, CWE-862 is the more specific and appropriate CWE.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-862 directly addresses the **missing authorization** check on the server side, which is the root cause of the vulnerability. CWE-284 is a more general term and is discouraged when a more specific CWE is applicable.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names. The associated manipulations are intended to generate multiple names for the same object.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nI considered this, but it doesn't fit the vulnerability which is related to **missing authorization** rather than path manipulation.\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing') [CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')]\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nWhile this is close, it's more about directly accessing resources without proper authorization, but the root cause is still the **missing authorization** check (CWE-862).\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nThis is not the primary issue.
