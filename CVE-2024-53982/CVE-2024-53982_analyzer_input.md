# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-53982

## Vulnerability Description
ZOO-Project is a C-based WPS (Web Processing Service) implementation. A **path traversal vulnerability** was discovered in Zoo-Project Echo example. The Echo example available by default in Zoo installs implements file caching, which can be controlled by user-given parameters. No input validation is performed in this parameter, which allows an attacker to fully control the file which is returned in the response. Patch was committed in November 22nd, 2024.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **improper input validation**
- **weakness:** **path traversal vulnerability**
- **impact:** control file return in response
- **vector:** path traversal
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** ZOO-Project

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of input validation in the file caching mechanism of the Zoo-Project Echo example. Specifically, the application allows user-provided parameters to control the file path used in file caching without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Path Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is path traversal. Due to the lack of input validation, an attacker can manipulate the file path parameter to access files outside the intended directory.
*   **Arbitrary File Download:** By controlling the file path, an attacker can force the application to download arbitrary files from the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Confidentiality Breach:** Attackers can potentially gain access to sensitive information stored on the server by downloading files containing configuration, credentials, or other sensitive data.
*   **System Compromise:** In severe cases, attackers might be able to download executable files, potentially leading to further system compromise, although not directly from the described vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through the manipulation of user-controlled parameters that specify the file path for caching in the Echo example.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable application and manipulate the input parameters controlling the file caching mechanism. No special privileges are required.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The fix involves checking if the requested file path using the `file://` protocol is in the list of `allowedPaths`.
*   The vulnerability is present in versions up to commit `641cb18fec58de43a3468f314e5f8808c560e6d9`
*   There is no workaround, and patching to the version including the fix is recommended.
* The vulnerability has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2024-53982
*   The vulnerability is categorized as CWE-434 (Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type)
