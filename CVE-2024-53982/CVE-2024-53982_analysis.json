  "description": "ZOO-Project is a C-based WPS (Web Processing Service) implementation. A **path traversal vulnerability** was discovered in Zoo-Project Echo example. The Echo example available by default in Zoo installs implements file caching, which can be controlled by user-given parameters. No input validation is performed in this parameter, which allows an attacker to fully control the file which is returned in the response. Patch was committed in November 22nd, 2024.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe vulnerability stems from a lack of input validation in the file caching mechanism of the Zoo-Project Echo example. Specifically, the application allows user-provided parameters to control the file path used in file caching without proper sanitization.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n*   **Path Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is path traversal. Due to the lack of input validation, an attacker can manipulate the file path parameter to access files outside the intended directory.\n*   **Arbitrary File Download:** By controlling the file path, an attacker can force the application to download arbitrary files from the server.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n*   **Confidentiality Breach:** Attackers can potentially gain access to sensitive information stored on the server by downloading files containing configuration, credentials, or other sensitive data.\n*   **System Compromise:** In severe cases, attackers might be able to download executable files, potentially leading to further system compromise, although not directly from the described vulnerability.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n*   The attack vector is through the manipulation of user-controlled parameters that specify the file path for caching in the Echo example.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n*   The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable application and manipulate the input parameters controlling the file caching mechanism. No special privileges are required.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n*   The fix involves checking if the requested file path using the `file://` protocol is in the list of `allowedPaths`.\n*   The vulnerability is present in versions up to commit `641cb18fec58de43a3468f314e5f8808c560e6d9`\n*   There is no workaround, and patching to the version including the fix is recommended.\n* The vulnerability has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2024-53982\n*   The vulnerability is categorized as CWE-434 (Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type)",

The vulnerability is due to **improper limitation of pathname** to restricted directory |\n| CWE-73 | External Control of File Name or Path | 0.8 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The **external control of file name or path** can influence the path traversal.|\n| CWE-20 | Improper Input Validation | 0.6 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary CWE. The **improper input validation** is the root cause which leads to path traversal.|\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-22, which represents the core vulnerability of path traversal. CWE-73 is related as the external control of the filename or path enables the path traversal. CWE-20 is a more general weakness, representing the **improper input validation** that allows the path traversal to occur. The abstraction levels were considered to select the most specific CWE possible, with CWE-22 being the most descriptive at the Base level.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\"]\n    cwe73[\"CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    \n    cwe22 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe73\n    cwe22 -->|ROOT_CAUSE| cwe20\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe22 primary\n    class cwe73,cwe20 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper input validation** (CWE-20), which allows external control of the file name or path (CWE-73). This leads to the primary vulnerability: improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory, also known as path traversal (CWE-22). The impact is the ability to control the file returned in the response, potentially leading to arbitrary file download and information disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified the core vulnerability as a **path traversal** issue. The retriever results and the vulnerability description both strongly support this classification. The relationship analysis further clarified the connection between the **improper input validation**, the external control of the file path, and the resulting path traversal vulnerability. The decision to select CWE-22 as the primary CWE is based on its specific description aligning with the vulnerability details: \"The product uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the product does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.\" This is directly evidenced by the statement that \"No input validation is performed in this parameter, which allows an attacker to fully control the file which is returned in the response.\" The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, providing a clear and accurate representation of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n**CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')**\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the product does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.\n\n**CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path**\nThe product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.\n\n**CWE-20: Improper Input Validation**\nThe product receives input or data, but it does\n        not validate or incorrectly validates that the input has the\n        properties that are required to process the data safely and\n        correctly.\n\nCWE-434 (Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type) was mentioned in the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, but this does not appear to be an upload issue, but rather an improper path handling issue, therefore it was not included.",
