CWE-862 and CWE-425 are related to authorization issues, and while they could contribute to the **sensitive information exposure**, they are not the most direct representation of the vulnerability. The hierarchical relationship is that CWE-200 is a general case of information exposure, and other CWEs like improper authorization could lead to this exposure. The chosen CWEs are at the Class and Base level of abstraction, which is appropriate given the information available.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe425[\"CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\"]\n    \n    cwe862 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe200\n    cwe425 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe862,cwe425 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **missing authorization** or **incorrect access control** on posts restricted to higher-level roles. Because of this **missing authorization**, sensitive information is exposed to unauthorized actors via the WordPress core search feature. The root cause is the **lack of proper access control**, leading to the impact of **sensitive information exposure**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is the **Sensitive Information Exposure** due to the ability of unauthenticated attackers to extract sensitive data from restricted posts. This maps directly to CWE-200. Supporting evidence includes the vulnerability description, which explicitly states \"Sensitive Information Exposure\" and that the impact is the extraction of sensitive data.\n\nCWE-862 (Missing Authorization) and CWE-425 (Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')) were considered as contributing factors since they are related to access control, but the vulnerability description focuses on the **exposure of sensitive information** rather than the specific mechanism of bypassing authorization. They are possible prerequisites that could lead to CWE-200.\n\nThe selection of CWE-200 is based on the clear statement of **Sensitive Information Exposure** in the vulnerability description. The other CWEs were considered, but CWE-200 most accurately represents the core weakness. It is also at the appropriate level of specificity (Class) given the available information.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as
