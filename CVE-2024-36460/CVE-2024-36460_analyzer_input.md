### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **unprotected plaintext passwords**
- **impact:** view unprotected plaintext passwords
- **component:** front-end audit log

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-36460:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the Zabbix frontend audit log storing passwords in plaintext. This occurs because the system does not properly mask or protect sensitive password data before logging it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Plaintext Storage of Passwords (CWE-256):**  The core issue is that passwords are not hashed or encrypted before being written to the audit log. This directly violates security best practices.
- **Exposure of Sensitive Data:** The audit log, designed to track actions, inadvertently exposes sensitive credentials.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Credential Compromise:** Attackers who gain access to the audit log can easily retrieve plaintext passwords.
- **Impersonation Attacks:** Stolen passwords can be used to impersonate legitimate users, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the Zabbix system and its connected resources.
- **Privilege Escalation**: If an administrator password is compromised, it could give an attacker complete control of the Zabbix system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Access to Audit Logs:** An attacker needs to gain access to the Zabbix frontend audit logs. This could be achieved through:
    - Exploiting a separate vulnerability on the system hosting Zabbix
    - Social engineering
    - Brute-forcing or credential stuffing of the Zabbix front end.
    - Internal compromised users.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to Zabbix Frontend**: The attacker must have access to the Zabbix frontend, specifically the audit logs.
- **Privilege Level:** Depending on the access control of the audit log functionality, the attacker may need only limited privileges on the Zabbix instance.
- **Technical Knowledge:** Basic knowledge of accessing and navigating Zabbix and understanding of log files is required.

**Additional Information:**
- **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 8.1, indicating a "High" severity.
- **Affected Versions:** Zabbix versions 5.0.0 through 5.0.42, 6.0.0 through 6.0.30, 6.4.0 through 6.4.15, and 7.0.0alpha1 through 7.0.0 are affected.
- **Fixed Versions:** This issue is resolved in versions 5.0.43rc1, 6.0.31rc1, 6.4.16rc1, 7.0.1rc1, and 7.2.0alpha1.
- **Mitigation:**  The resolution involves masking or otherwise protecting passwords in the audit log output.
