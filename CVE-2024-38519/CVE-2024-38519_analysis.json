  "description": "`yt-dlp` and `youtube-dl` are command-line audio/video downloaders. Prior to the fixed versions, `yt-dlp` and `youtube-dl` **do not limit the extensions of downloaded files**, which could lead to arbitrary filenames being created in the download folder (and **path traversal** on Windows). Since `yt-dlp` and `youtube-dl` also read config from the working directory (and on Windows executables will be executed from the `yt-dlp` or `youtube-dl` directory), this could lead to arbitrary code being executed. `yt-dlp` version 2024.07.01 fixes this issue by whitelisting the allowed extensions. `youtube-dl` fixes this issue in commit `d42a222` on the `master` branch and in nightly builds tagged 2024-07-03 or later. This might mean some very uncommon extensions might not get downloaded, however it will also limit the possible exploitation surface. In addition to upgrading, have `.%(ext)s` at the end of the output template and make sure the user trusts the websites that they are downloading from. Also, make sure to never download to a directory within PATH or other sensitive locations like ones user directory, `system32`, or other binaries locations. For users who are not able to upgrade, keep the default output template (`-o %(title)s [%(id)s].%(ext)s`) make sure the extension of the media to download is a common video/audio/sub/... one try to avoid the generic extractor and/or use `--ignore-config --config-location ...` to not load config from common locations.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2024-38519:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of file extensions used when downloading files, particularly subtitles, by both `youtube-dl` and `yt-dlp`. The programs would blindly trust the extensions provided by the website or extracted from the URL.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n1.  **Unrestricted File Extensions:** The applications did not have a whitelist of allowed file extensions. This allowed arbitrary extensions to be used, which could include path traversal characters.\n\n2.  **Path Traversal:** On Windows, path separators (`/` and `\\`) within the file extension could be used to create files outside the intended download directory. For example, an extension like `../../malicious.exe` could overwrite files in parent directories.\n\n3.  **Local Code Execution:** By writing files with executable extensions (e.g., `.exe`) in the program's working directory, it becomes possible to achieve arbitrary code execution upon the next invocation of the application or via the usage of a specially crafted configuration file.\n\n4.  **URL Smuggling:** Attackers can exploit the way some extractors handle URL fragments, injecting malicious URLs for subtitle downloads which in turn are used to extract and write the crafted file with a malicious extension.\n\n5.  **Generic Extractor Vulnerability:** Attackers can leverage the generic extractor to host a page that embeds a supported video website.  This allows them to hide the URL smuggling attack from a user.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **File System Modification:** An attacker can overwrite or create arbitrary files in locations accessible to the user.\n*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Overwriting executable files or using specially crafted config files can lead to RCE.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Maliciously Crafted Subtitle Extensions:** Attackers can inject path traversal sequences or executable extensions within subtitle file names.\n*   **Compromised Websites:** If a website supported by the applications is compromised, attackers could manipulate subtitle URLs or metadata.\n*   **URL Smuggling:** Attackers can inject malicious URLs through URL fragments.\n*  **Generic Extractor:** Attackers can host a page that embeds a supported video website, hiding malicious URLs.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   The attacker needs the ability to control or manipulate the subtitle file extensions or the URLs from which the subtitles are downloaded.\n*   For local code execution, the attacker needs the ability to write to the user's file system within a directory that is part of the program's search path or the same directory where the application is located.\n*   User interaction is required, as the user must initiate the download with the application.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n*   The vulnerability is more easily exploited on Windows due to the way it handles path traversal characters in file names. Linux and macOS are less susceptible to path traversal in this specific case.\n*   Both `youtube-dl` and `yt-dlp` were affected. `yt-dlp` addressed the issue with version 2024.07.01, while `youtube-dl` was patched by commit `d42a222`.\n*   The fix involves a whitelist of allowed file extensions and disallowing path separators in provided file extensions.\n\n**Mitigations:**\n\n*   Upgrade to the patched version of `youtube-dl` or `yt-dlp`.\n*   Use the `--no-check-extensions` option with caution.\n*   Ensure output templates have `.%(ext)s` at the end to control the extension.\n*   Download from trusted websites.\n*   Avoid downloading to directories within the system's `PATH` or other sensitive locations.\n*   Omit subtitle download options when possible.",
