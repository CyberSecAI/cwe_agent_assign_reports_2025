  "query": "In gaizhenbiao/chuanhuchatgpt, specifically the version tagged as 20240121, there exists a vulnerability due to improper access control mechanisms. This flaw allows an authenticated attacker to bypass intended access restrictions and read the `history` files of other users, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive information. The vulnerability is present in the applications handling of access control for the `history` path, where no adequate mechanism is in place to prevent an authenticated user from accessing another users chat history files. This issue poses a significant risk as it could allow attackers to obtain sensitive information from the chat history of other users.",
