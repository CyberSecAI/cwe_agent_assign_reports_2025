## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-3700

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of a hard-coded password for the patient database within the Simple Care software. This password is the same across all installations of the software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Hard-coded Credentials (CWE-798):** The primary weakness is the use of a static, hard-coded password embedded within the software. This eliminates the need for attackers to guess the password and makes it universally exploitable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Sensitive Data Exposure:** An attacker can use the hard-coded password to access the patient database and retrieve sensitive data stored within. The document mentions that this data is considered especially protected.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network Access:** The document notes that medical facilities frequently allow database access via the public internet which makes this attack vector much easier for remote attackers. Attackers would need to have network access to the database (which can be from the Internet if publicly exposed), and the hardcoded credentials to access it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Knowledge of the Hard-coded Password:** An attacker needs to acquire the hard-coded password, which is the same across all installations of the vulnerable software. This information could be obtained through various means such as reverse engineering of the software, information sharing or public disclosure.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the database server, which might be exposed directly to the Internet in some cases according to the report.

**Additional Information:**
*   **Affected Product:** Estomed Sp. z o.o. Simple Care software
*   **Affected Versions:** All versions of the software are affected since the software is no longer supported.
*   **Mitigation:** There is no mitigation since the software is no longer supported. The report recommends that medical facilities do not expose the database to the public Internet, and instead should rely on private networks (VPN) and multi-factor authentication.
*   The report also includes similar vulnerabilities in Eurosoft Przychodnia (CVE-2024-1228) and drEryk Gabinet (CVE-2024-3699), both caused by hard-coded database passwords.
