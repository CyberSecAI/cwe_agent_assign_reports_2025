  "description": "Kofax Power PDF JP2 File Parsing **Out-Of-Bounds Read** Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Kofax Power PDF. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of JP2 files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated object. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-22020.",

While **improper input validation** is the root cause, the specific manifestation of this **lack of proper validation** is an **out-of-bounds read**. CWE-125 is a more specific child of CWE-119, which is a child of CWE-20. Therefore, CWE-125 provides a more accurate representation of the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    \n    cwe125 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe119 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe125 primary\n    class cwe20 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper input validation** (CWE-20), leading to an **out-of-bounds read** (CWE-125), which can then lead to arbitrary code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis considered CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) due to its high score in the Retriever Results and being the Primary CWE Match for similar vulnerabilities. However, the vulnerability description clearly states \"**Out-Of-Bounds Read**\", indicating that the program is reading memory outside the allocated buffer, not writing to it.\n\nThe selection of CWE-125 is strongly supported by the vulnerability description, which explicitly mentions the \"**Out-Of-Bounds Read**\" condition. The description also indicates that the root cause is the \"**lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**\". This aligns with the characteristics of CWE-125, where the program reads data past the end or before the beginning of the intended buffer due to **insufficient validation**.\n\nCWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) is considered as a secondary CWE because the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data** is the root cause. However, CWE-125 more accurately describes the specific type of vulnerability.\n\nThe chosen CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity.

While **improper input validation** is the root cause, the specific manifestation of this **lack of proper validation** is an **out-of-bounds read**. CWE-125 is a more specific child of CWE-119, which is a child of CWE-20. Therefore, CWE-125 provides a more accurate representation of the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    \n    cwe125 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe119 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe125 primary\n    class cwe20 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper input validation** (CWE-20), leading to an **out-of-bounds read** (CWE-125), which can then lead to arbitrary code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis considered CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) due to its high score in the Retriever Results and being the Primary CWE Match for similar vulnerabilities. However, the vulnerability description clearly states \"**Out-Of-Bounds Read**\", indicating that the program is reading memory outside the allocated buffer, not writing to it.\n\nThe selection of CWE-125 is strongly supported by the vulnerability description, which explicitly mentions the \"**Out-Of-Bounds Read**\" condition. The description also indicates that the root cause is the \"**lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**\". This aligns with the characteristics of CWE-125, where the program reads data past the end or before the beginning of the intended buffer due to **insufficient validation**.\n\nCWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) is considered as a secondary CWE because the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data** is the root cause. However, CWE-125 more accurately describes the specific type of vulnerability.\n\nThe chosen CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity.
