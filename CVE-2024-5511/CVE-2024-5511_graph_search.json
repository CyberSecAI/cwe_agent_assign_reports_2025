This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Kofax Power PDF. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of JP2 files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated object. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-22020. Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-20 CWE-1284 CWE-95 CWE-434 CWE-611 CWE-787 CWE-122 CWE-502 CWE-125 CWE-22",
