# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2025-41652

# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2025-41652
## Query
The devices are vulnerable to an authentication bypass due to flaws in the authorization mechanism. An unauthenticated remote attacker could exploit this weakness by performing brute-force attacks to guess valid credentials or by using MD5 collision techniques to forge authentication hashes, potentially compromising the device.

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: 'flaws in the authorization mechanism'
