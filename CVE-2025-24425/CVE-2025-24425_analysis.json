CWE-285 was also considered because it relates to authorization, which can be bypassed due to business logic errors. CWE-285 is a child of the Access Control Concepts pillar. Choosing CWE-840 focuses on the root cause of the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe840[\"CWE-840: Business Logic Errors\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe285 -- CANBE caused by --> cwe840\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe840 primary\n    class cwe285 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **Business Logic Error** (CWE-840), which leads to a security feature bypass. This bypass could then result in limited data modification. The root cause is the **incorrect implementation of business logic**, and the impact is the circumvention of security mechanisms.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-840 as the primary weakness, based on the **root cause** being a **Business Logic Error**. The vulnerability description explicitly states this. The other CWEs such as CWE-285, CWE-200, CWE-22, CWE-425, and CWE-639 were considered but deemed secondary because they represent potential impacts or related issues rather than the core flaw.\n\nThe selection of CWE-840 is based on the evidence that the application's business logic is flawed, leading to the security bypass. This is at an appropriate level of specificity because it identifies the type of error. I am confident that this is the correct classification because the vulnerability description explicitly identifies a **Business Logic Error** as the root cause.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-200 is commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error.
