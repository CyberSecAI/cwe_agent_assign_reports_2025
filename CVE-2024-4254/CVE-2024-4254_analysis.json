  "description": "The deploy-website.yml workflow in the gradio-app/gradio repository, specifically in the main branch, is vulnerable to secrets exfiltration due to **improper authorization**. The vulnerability arises from the workflows explicit checkout and execution of code from a fork, which is unsafe as it allows the running of untrusted code in an environment with access to push to the base repository and access secrets. This flaw could lead to the exfiltration of sensitive secrets such as GITHUB_TOKEN, HF_TOKEN, VERCEL_ORG_ID, VERCEL_PROJECT_ID, COMMENT_TOKEN, AWSACCESSKEYID, AWSSECRETKEY, and VERCEL_TOKEN. The vulnerability is present in the workflow file located at https//github.com/gradio-app/gradio/blob/72f4ca88ab569aae47941b3fb0609e57f2e13a27/.github/workflows/deploy-website.yml.",

CWE-214 (Invocation of Process Using Visible Sensitive Information) and CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data) are potential consequences of the **improper authorization**. CWE-863 is a child of CWE-284 (Improper Access Control), which is a more general case. Given the specific authorization **root cause** identified, CWE-863 is more appropriate than CWE-284.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe214[\"CWE-214: Invocation of Process Using Visible Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe214 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe863\n    cwe201 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe863\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe214,cwe201 secondary\n    class cwe284 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with **improper authorization** (CWE-863), leading to the invocation of a process using visible sensitive information (CWE-214) and the insertion of sensitive information into sent data (CWE-201), ultimately resulting in the exfiltration of secrets.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the vulnerability description, which identifies **improper authorization** as the **root cause**. The vulnerability allows the execution of untrusted code with access to sensitive secrets. This aligns with CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization), which is a Class-level CWE. The **improper authorization** leads to the invocation of a process using visible sensitive information (CWE-214) and the insertion of sensitive information into sent data (CWE-201). While CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) is a parent of CWE-863, it is less specific and thus less appropriate. The selection of CWE-863 is further supported by the retriever results.\n\nThe evidence for **improper authorization** is: \"The deploy-website.yml workflow in the gradio-app/gradio repository, specifically in the main branch, is vulnerable to secrets exfiltration due to **improper authorization**.\"\n\nCWE-214 is included because the untrusted code is being invoked with access to secrets. CWE-201 is included because the secrets are being exfiltrated.\n\nThe retriever results support the selection of CWE-863.\n\nCWE-284, CWE-285, and CWE-306 were considered but not selected because the description explicitly states the issue is **improper authorization**, not missing authentication or general access control.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
