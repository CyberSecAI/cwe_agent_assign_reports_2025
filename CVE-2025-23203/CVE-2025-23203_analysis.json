  "description": "Icinga Director is an Icinga config deployment tool. A Security vulnerability has been found starting in version 1.0.0 and prior to 1.10.3 and 1.11.3 on several director endpoints of REST API. To reproduce this vulnerability an authenticated user with permission to access the Director is required (plus api access with regard to the api endpoints). And even though some of these Icinga Director users are restricted from accessing certain objects, are able to retrieve information related to them if their name is known. This makes it possible to change the configuration of these objects by those Icinga Director users restricted from accessing them. This results in further exploitation, data breaches and sensitive information disclosure. Affected endpoints include icingaweb2/director/service, if the host name is left out of the query icingaweb2/directore/notification icingaweb2/director/serviceset and icingaweb2/director/scheduled-downtime. In addition, the endpoint `icingaweb2/director/services?host=filteredHostName` returns a status code 200 even though the services for the host is filtered. This in turn lets the restricted user know that the host `filteredHostName` exists even though the user is restricted from accessing it. This could again result in further exploitation of this information and data breaches. Icinga Director has patches in versions 1.10.3 and 1.11.1. If upgrading is not feasible, disable the director module for the users other than admin role for the time being.",

It details a security vulnerability in Icinga Director and provides information about its fix in versions 1.10.3 and 1.11.3. The content provides more detail than the placeholder CVE description.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from REST API endpoints being accessible to restricted users, allowing them to retrieve information and potentially modify configurations of objects they shouldn't have access to. Specifically, the issue arises when the host name is omitted from queries to certain endpoints.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **Improper Access Control:** Restricted users can access information about objects they are not authorized to view.\n*   **Exposure of Sensitive Information:**  The vulnerability allows unauthorized disclosure of information about restricted objects.\n*   **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** The initial report (GHSA-3mwp-5p5v-j6q3) mentions configuration susceptibility to CSRF.  A later release (v1.11.3) addresses a CSRF issue related to property sort tables.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   Configuration changes to objects by unauthorized users.\n*   Data breaches and sensitive information disclosure.\n*   Potential for further exploitation based on disclosed information.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Network access to the Icinga Director REST API endpoints.\n*   Authenticated user with limited permissions within the Icinga Director.\n*   Specifically, querying endpoints like `icingaweb2/director/service` without specifying a host name.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   An authenticated user with some level of access to the Icinga Director.\n*   Knowledge of the vulnerable API endpoints and how to query them.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   **Upgrade:** Upgrade to Icinga Director version 1.10.3 or 1.11.3 (or later).\n*   **Disable Access:** If upgrading is not immediately feasible, disable the Director module for users with roles other than administrator.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n*   **Affected endpoints:**\n    *   `icingaweb2/director/service?name=service-name` (when host name is omitted)\n    *   `icingaweb2/directore/notification`\n    *   `icingaweb2/director/serviceset`\n    *   `icingaweb2/director/scheduled-downtime`\n    *   `icingaweb2/director/services?host=filteredHostName` (returns 200 even when filtered)\n*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2025-23203\n*   **GHSA ID:** GHSA-3233-ggc5-m3qg\n*   **CWE IDs:** CWE-200, CWE-284\n*   **CVSS Score:** 5.5 (Moderate)",

Several child CWEs could potentially be more specific, but the information provided doesn't have enough detail to justify choosing a more specific child. CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) is a consequence of the authorization failure, not the root cause, making it a secondary concern.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe200 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe863\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **incorrect authorization** (CWE-863), leading to the **exposure of sensitive information** (CWE-200) to unauthorized actors. The root cause is the flawed authorization logic in the Icinga Director REST API endpoints.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified several candidate CWEs, particularly those related to authorization and information exposure. The final decision focused on CWE-863 as the primary weakness because it accurately reflects the root cause of the vulnerability, which is an incorrect authorization check. The vulnerability description states that even though some users are restricted from accessing certain objects, they are able to retrieve information related to them due to **incorrect authorization**. This leads to exposure of sensitive information, which is represented by CWE-200. CWE-200 is a result of the **incorrect authorization**, not the root cause. The selection of CWE-863 is further supported by the retriever results, which identified it as a relevant candidate. The other CWEs listed in the retriever results were considered but ultimately deemed less suitable because they either represented consequences of the **incorrect authorization** or were too general. The chosen CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity given the available information.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
