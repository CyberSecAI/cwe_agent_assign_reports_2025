# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2025-37959

## Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved bpf Scrub packet on bpf_redirect_peer When bpf_redirect_peer is used to redirect packets to a device in another network namespace, the skb isnt scrubbed. That can lead skb information from one namespace to be misused in another namespace. As one example, this is causing Cilium to drop traffic when using bpf_redirect_peer to redirect packets that just went through IPsec decryption to a container namespace. The following pwru trace shows (1) the packet path from the hosts XFRM layer to the containers XFRM layer where its dropped and (2) the number of active skb extensions at each function.

When we decrypt the IPsec packet, the XFRM state used for decryption is set in the skb extensions. This information is preserved across the netns switch. When we reach the XFRM policy check in the containers netns, __xfrm_policy_check drops the packet with LINUX_MIB_XFRMINNOPOLS because a (container-side) XFRM policy cant be found that matches the (host-side) XFRM state used for decryption. This patch fixes this by scrubbing the packet when using bpf_redirect_peer, as is done on typical netns switches via veth devices except skb->mark and skb->tstamp are not zeroed.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.70
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis

The primary weakness is the **improper handling of exceptional conditions** (CWE-755), specifically the condition where the skb isn't scrubbed when `bpf_redirect_peer` is used. This leads to information leakage between network namespaces. The related weakness is the **detection of the error condition without taking action** (CWE-390) i.e. the Linux kernel detects that the `skb` isn't scrubbed when it should be. The abstraction levels influenced the selection, prioritizing a Class-level CWE for a broader view of the exceptional condition, complemented by a Base-level CWE for the specific lack of action.

## Vulnerability Chain

The vulnerability chain starts with the kernel failing to scrub the `skb` when using `bpf_redirect_peer`. This **missing action** leads to **sensitive information** (XFRM state) being carried over to another network namespace. In the container's network namespace, this leads to a failed XFRM policy check and ultimately traffic being dropped. Thus, CWE-755 represents the root cause as the **improper handling** and CWE-390 the **lack of action**.

## Summary of Analysis

The initial assessment focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability based on the provided description. The key phrase "skb isn't scrubbed" indicated a **failure to handle a necessary condition**, leading to the selection of CWE-755.

The graph relationships helped to refine the analysis, showing how `CWE-390: Detection of Error Condition Without Action` is a child of `CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions`.

The final selection was based on the evidence that the kernel **detected** the need to scrub the packet, but **failed to take that action**. The selected CWEs are at an appropriate level of specificity, with `CWE-755` capturing the broad category of **improper handling** and `CWE-390` detailing the specific **lack of action**.
