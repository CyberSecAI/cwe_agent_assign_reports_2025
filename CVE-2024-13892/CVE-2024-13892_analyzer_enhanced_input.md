## Vulnerability Description
Smartwares cameras CIP-37210AT and C724IP, as well as others which share the same firmware in versions up to 3.3.0, are vulnerable to **command injection**. During the initialization process, a user has to use a mobile app to provide devices with Access Point credentials. This input is not properly sanitized, what allows for **command injection**. The vendor has not replied to reports, so the patching status remains unknown. Newer firmware versions might be vulnerable as well.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **improper input sanitization**
- **weakness:** **command injection**
- **product:** Smartwares cameras CIP-37210AT, C724IP
- **version:** up to 3.3.0
