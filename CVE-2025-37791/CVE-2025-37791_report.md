## Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ethtool cmis_cdb use correct rpl size in ethtool_cmis_module_poll() rpl is passed as a pointer to ethtool_cmis_module_poll(), so the correct size of rpl is sizeof(*rpl) which should be just 1 byte.

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 0.9 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-131 | Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size | 0.7 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship is that **CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write)** is a child of **CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer)**. **CWE-131 (Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size)** can **CANPRECEDE** CWE-119. This indicates that an incorrect buffer size calculation can lead to a buffer overflow, which then results in an out-of-bounds write. The abstraction levels are appropriate, with both CWEs being at the Base level.

```

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with an **incorrect calculation of the rpl size (CWE-131)**. This leads to writing beyond the intended buffer, resulting in an **out-of-bounds write (CWE-787)**, which then causes stack corruption and a kernel panic.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description, which indicates that the root cause is **using the pointer size instead of rpl size in ethtool_cmis_module_poll()**. This leads to stack corruption and a kernel panic. The retriever results and graph relationships support the selection of **CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write)** as the primary CWE because the stack corruption is a direct result of writing beyond the allocated buffer. **CWE-131 (Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size)** is selected as a secondary CWE because the vulnerability description also indicates that the root cause is the **incorrect calculation of the rpl size** which could lead to buffer overflow, and subsequent out-of-bounds write.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.
