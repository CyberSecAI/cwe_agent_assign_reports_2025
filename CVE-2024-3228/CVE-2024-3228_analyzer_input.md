## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-3228:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the Social Sharing Plugin â€“ Kiwi's failure to properly check if a post is password-protected before displaying social sharing buttons. Specifically, the `kiwi-nw-pinterest` class did not account for password-protected posts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Information Exposure: The plugin exposes limited content from password-protected posts to unauthenticated users.
- Lack of Access Control: The plugin does not enforce proper access controls related to password-protected content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthorized access to limited content of password-protected posts. This means attackers could view excerpts or other elements of content that are intended to be private.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
- The attack vector involves accessing the plugin's social sharing functionality through the `kiwi-nw-pinterest` class.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be unauthenticated, i.e., not logged in to the WordPress site.
- The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable WordPress site.
- The attacker does not require any special permissions or privileges on the system.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.1.8 by adding a check for `post_password_required()` in the affected files before rendering the social sharing buttons. This prevents the generation of the social sharing bar if the content is password protected.
- The vulnerability is present in all versions up to and including 2.1.7.
- The vulnerable code resides in the following files:
    - `includes/frontend/social-bars/class-kiwi-social-share-view-article-bar.php`
