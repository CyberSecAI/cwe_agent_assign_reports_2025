The vulnerability description and CVE reference link summary explicitly mention CSRF as the root cause. |\n| CWE-89 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary candidate. The vulnerability description mentions SQL Injection as the impact of the CSRF vulnerability. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship influencing the CWE selection is the chain relationship. CWE-352, Cross-Site Request Forgery, can lead to other vulnerabilities if successfully exploited. In this case, it leads to CWE-89, SQL Injection. The abstraction levels were also considered, with CWE-352 being a compound weakness and CWE-89 being a base weakness, reflecting their respective roles in the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n\n    cwe352 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe89\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe352 primary\n    class cwe89 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with CWE-352, Cross-Site Request Forgery (**ROOTCAUSE**).
