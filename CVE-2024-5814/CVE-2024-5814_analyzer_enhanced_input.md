## Vulnerability Description
A malicious TLS1.2 server can force a TLS1.3 client with downgrade capability to use a ciphersuite that it did not agree to and achieve a successful connection. This is because, aside from the extensions, the **client was skipping fully parsing the server hello**. https//doi.org/10.46586/tches.v2024.i1.457-500

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **client was skipping fully parsing the server hello**
- **impact:** force a TLS1.3 client with downgrade capability to use a ciphersuite that it did not agree to and achieve a successful connection
- **attacker:** malicious TLS1.2 server
