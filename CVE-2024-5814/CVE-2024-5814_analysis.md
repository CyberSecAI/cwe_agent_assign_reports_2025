# Analysis for CVE-2024-5814

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-757 | Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation ('Algorithm Downgrade') | 0.8 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE. The **client was skipping fully parsing the server hello**, leading to a less secure algorithm being used. |
| CWE-200 | Information Exposure | 0.4 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary CWE. Although not explicitly stated, forcing a client to use a less secure cipher suite could lead to information exposure. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that impacts the decision is the hierarchical structure. CWE-757 is a Base CWE, which makes it more specific than class-level CWEs. The vulnerability description clearly points to the selection of a less secure algorithm due to improper parsing, thus the mapping is most accurate at the base level.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **client skipping fully parsing the server hello**. This leads to the **selection of a less secure algorithm**, which finally results in a successful connection using a ciphersuite not agreed upon by the client, potentially leading to **information exposure**.

## Summary of Analysis
The primary assessment is based on the provided evidence, specifically the vulnerability description that mentions the **client skipping fully parsing the server hello**. This **rootcause** directly leads to the selection of a less secure algorithm. The retriever results also support CWE-757 as a potential match.

The relationship analysis confirms that CWE-757 is the most specific and relevant CWE. It is a Base level CWE and accurately represents the weakness described in the vulnerability. While other CWEs like CWE-200 (Information Exposure) could be potential impacts, CWE-757 directly addresses the **rootcause**.

The selection of CWE-757 is based on the evidence from the vulnerability description, the retriever results, and the relationship analysis. It is at the optimal level of specificity, being a Base CWE.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation ('Algorithm Downgrade')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A protocol or its implementation supports interaction between multiple actors and allows those actors to negotiate which algorithm should be used as a protection mechanism such as encryption or authentication, but it does not select the strongest algorithm that is available to both parties.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not validate, or incorrectly validates, a certificate.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-297: Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product communicates with a host that provides a certificate, but the product does not properly ensure that the certificate is actually associated with that host.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-346: Origin Validation Error
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly verify that the source of data or communication is valid.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.

**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
Two separate operations in a product require different amounts of time to complete, in a way that is observable to an actor and reveals security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-617: Reachable Assertion
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
