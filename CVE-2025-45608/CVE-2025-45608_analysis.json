  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-45608 Content\n\nBased on the provided content, this relates to an **Incorrect Access Control** vulnerability.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation, allowing path traversal. Specifically, appending `../` to the API endpoint bypasses authentication.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **Incorrect Access Control:** The application fails to properly restrict access to sensitive API endpoints.\n*   **Path Traversal:** The application is vulnerable to path traversal attacks, allowing an attacker to access resources outside the intended directory.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   **Information Leakage:**  The vulnerability allows unauthorized access to user data.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   **Remote:** The attack can be performed remotely via HTTP requests.\n*   Specifically, sending a crafted GET request to `/static;/../system/user/findUserList` bypasses authentication.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable API endpoint.\n*   No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability due to the bypass.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\nThe content does not provide specific mitigation or fix details. However, proper input validation and sanitization to prevent path traversal are necessary.\n\n**More detail than official CVE description:**\n\nYes, the content provides significantly more detail than a typical CVE description. It includes:\n\n*   Specific API endpoint affected (`/system/user/findUserList`).\n*   The exact payload used to exploit the vulnerability.\n*   Screenshots demonstrating the vulnerability.\n*   Version information (<= 0.0.1-SNAPSHOT).\n*   Detailed explanation of the attack vector.",

Given the evidence points to an authorization flaw rather than a complete lack of authentication, CWE-863 was chosen as more specific than CWE-284, but more general than CWE-306. The path traversal described in the analysis portion of the CVE content led to the selection of CWE-22 as a related weakness.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe202[\"CWE-202: Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Data Queries\"]\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe22 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe863\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe202,cwe22,cwe284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **incorrect access control** (CWE-863). The path traversal vulnerability (CWE-22) allows bypassing intended access restrictions. This leads to **exposure of sensitive information** (CWE-202).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on access control-related CWEs due to the \"incorrect access control\" key phrase. The retriever results supported this direction, highlighting CWE-306, CWE-284, and CWE-863. However, the more detailed content from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary provided evidence of path traversal (CWE-22) being used to bypass authentication, and the impact being information exposure (CWE-202).\n\nThe selection of CWE-863 over CWE-284 and CWE-306 was based on the guidance provided, which emphasizes using more specific CWEs when possible. While CWE-284 is a general \"Improper Access Control\" category, CWE-863 represents \"Incorrect Authorization,\" indicating that an authorization check was in place but was flawed. CWE-306 indicates a complete absence of authentication, which isn't the case based on the description. The path traversal identified in the CVE analysis is a mechanism to bypass the existing **incorrect authorization**.\n\nThe selection of CWE-202 is due to the impact of the vulnerability i.e. the exposure of sensitive information through data queries.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they represent the root cause **incorrect access control**, the attack vector used to bypass authorization (path traversal), and the resulting impact of the vulnerability i.e. the exposure of sensitive information.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
