  "query": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved wifi cfg80211 init wiphy_work before allocating rfkill fails syzbort reported a uninitialize wiphy_work_lock in cfg80211_dev_free. [1] After rfkill allocation fails, the wiphy release process will be performed, which will cause cfg80211_dev_free to access the uninitialized wiphy_work related data. Move the initialization of wiphy_work to before rfkill initialization to avoid this issue. [1] INFO trying to register non-static key. The code is fine but needs lockdep annotation, or maybe you didnt initialize this object before use? turning off the locking correctness validator.
