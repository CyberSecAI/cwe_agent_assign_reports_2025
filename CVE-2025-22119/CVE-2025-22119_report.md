# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2025-22119

## Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved wifi cfg80211 init wiphy_work before allocating rfkill fails syzbort reported a uninitialize wiphy_work_lock in cfg80211_dev_free. [1] After rfkill allocation fails, the wiphy release process will be performed, which will cause cfg80211_dev_free to access the uninitialized wiphy_work related data. Move the initialization of wiphy_work to before rfkill initialization to avoid this issue. [1] INFO trying to register non-static key. The code is fine but needs lockdep annotation, or maybe you didnt initialize this object before use? turning off the locking correctness validator.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Rootcause:** uninitialized wiphy_work_lock

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-909 | Missing Initialization of Resource | 0.9 | Class | Primary | Allowed-with-Review |
| CWE-667 | Improper Locking | 0.7 | Class | Secondary | Allowed-with-Review |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-909, which is a Class-level CWE. While it's generally preferred to use Base or Variant level CWEs, in this case, the description clearly indicates a **missing initialization** problem. There isn't a more specific CWE available that fits better. CWE-667 is also considered because the **uninitialized resource** is related to locking, but CWE-909 is more directly related to the **root cause**.

```

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **missing initialization** of `wiphy_work_lock` (CWE-909). Because the `wiphy_work_lock` is not initialized, it leads to a locking issue (CWE-667) when `cfg80211_dev_free` attempts to access the **uninitialized** data, resulting in a crash.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description, particularly the key phrase "**uninitialized wiphy_work_lock**". This directly points to CWE-909, Missing Initialization of Resource. The call trace further confirms that the issue occurs during the `cfg80211_dev_free` function, where the **uninitialized** `wiphy_work` related data is accessed. The retriever results also support CWE-909 as a strong candidate. While other CWEs like CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference) or CWE-415 (Double Free) were considered, they don't accurately represent the **root cause** of the vulnerability, which is the **missing initialization**. The selection of CWE-909 is at the optimal level of specificity because there are no child CWEs that describe the specific type of resource that wasn't initialized.

## CWE-665: Improper Initialization
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not initialize or incorrectly initializes a resource, which might leave the resource in an unexpected state when it is accessed or used.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
