The `duckdb` binary must also be present in Grafana\u2019s $PATH for the attack to work, which is not the default configuration.",

Both CWE-78 and CWE-22 are children of **CWE-74**, which is a discouraged CWE due to its high-level nature. **CWE-138** is a general class of improper neutralization, and **CWE-20** is a general class of improper input validation.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: OS Command Injection\"]\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Path Traversal\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization\"]\n    cwe138[\"CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n\n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe22 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe22 secondary\n    class cwe74,cwe138,cwe20 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **insufficient input sanitization**, leading to both a **command injection** (**CWE-78**) and a **local file inclusion** (**CWE-22**) vulnerability. A user with VIEWER or higher permissions can exploit this chain because of the **insufficient input sanitization**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description. The primary weakness is **CWE-78**, as the vulnerability allows for **command injection** due to **insufficient input sanitization** of `duckdb` queries. This is further supported by the description stating the queries are \"insufficiently sanitized before being passed to `duckdb`.\" **CWE-22** is the secondary weakness, as the vulnerability also allows for **local file inclusion** due to the same **insufficient input sanitization**. These two weaknesses are distinct and stem from the same root cause.\n\nThe relationship graph shows how the more general **CWE-74** relates to the more specific **CWE-78** and **CWE-22**, but **CWE-74** is discouraged.\nThe other general classes of **CWE-138** and **CWE-20** could be considered, but again are discouraged.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly represent the two distinct vulnerabilities (**command injection** and **local file inclusion**) that arise from the **insufficient input sanitization**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n*   The vulnerability description explicitly states that the queries are \"insufficiently sanitized before being passed to `duckdb`\", indicating a lack of proper input validation or neutralization.\n*   The vulnerability allows for both \"command injection\" and \"local file inclusion\".\n\nI considered CWE-89 ('SQL Injection'), but it is not the best fit as the queries are passed to `duckdb`, not directly to an SQL database.\nI considered CWE-94 ('Code Injection'), but it is not the best fit as the vulnerability allows command injection in the operating system.\nI considered CWE-138 ('Improper Neutralization of Special Elements') as it is the highest scoring CWE, but it is discouraged and is too general of a class.\nI considered CWE-20 ('Improper Input Validation') as it is mentioned in the rootcause analysis, but it is discouraged and is too general of a class.",
