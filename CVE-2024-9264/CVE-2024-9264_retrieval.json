These queries are insufficiently sanitized before being passed to `duckdb`, leading to a **command injection** and ****local file inclusion** vulnerability**. Any user with the VIEWER or higher permission is capable of executing this attack. The `duckdb` binary must be present in Grafanas $PATH for this attack to function by default, this binary is not installed in Grafana distributions.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'insufficient input sanitization'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1.
