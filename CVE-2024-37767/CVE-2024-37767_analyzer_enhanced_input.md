## Vulnerability Description
**Insecure permissions** in the component /api/admin/user of 14Finger v1.1 allows attackers to access all user information via a crafted GET request.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **Insecure permissions**
- **impact:** access all user information
- **vector:** crafted GET request
- **attacker:** attackers
- **product:** 14Finger
- **version:** v1.1
- **component:** /api/admin/user

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities reported in the GitHub issue:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The core issue across all reported vulnerabilities is the lack of strict verification of user identity and permissions before allowing operations. The application, "14Finger," does not adequately check if the current user has the authority to perform the requested action.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The following vulnerabilities were identified:

1.  **14Finger User Sensitive Information Leakage Vulnerability**: The application leaks sensitive user information.
2.  **14Finger User Privilege Escalation Vulnerability**: Users are able to gain higher privileges than they should possess.
3.  **14Finger Arbitrary User Deletion Vulnerability**:  Users can delete other users' accounts, which they should not be able to do.
4.  **14Finger Arbitrary User Password Reset Vulnerability**: Users can reset other users' passwords.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Leakage**: Sensitive user data can be exposed.
*   **Privilege Escalation**: Unauthorized users can gain administrative or higher-level access.
*   **Arbitrary User Deletion**:  Malicious users can delete accounts, causing data loss and disruption.
*   **Arbitrary Password Reset**: Unauthorized users can lock out legitimate users by changing their passwords.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through the application's interface or API, where a user can manipulate requests to perform unauthorized operations due to a lack of proper permission checks. The specific attack vectors would depend on the implementation of the application's user management functionality.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker would need to have a valid account within the "14Finger" application. The vulnerability can be exploited by a normal authenticated user if the application does not have the proper authorization mechanism in place.

The content provides more detail than the official CVE description, as it outlines four specific user management related vulnerabilities and provides a general root cause and possible fix.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* 🔍 *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* 🔍 *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion – CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### 🔸 CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ✅ *“A user created with the ‘guest’ role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ✅ *“The backup service runs as root but only needs read access.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ⚠️ This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### 🔸 CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ✅ *“User can access another user’s invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.”*

## Mapping Examples – Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *“User can escalate privileges to admin.”*
> ❌ Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged – only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ✅ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**

| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| “Escalate to root/admin”                    | Privilege escalation impact           | Not CWE-269! Use root cause (e.g., 266, 250) |
| “Assigned wrong role/group”                 | Misassigned privilege                 | CWE-266                                      |
| “Runs as root” or “Should not run as admin” | Over-privileged execution             | CWE-250                                      |
| “Unauthorized read/write to file”           | Permission control issue              | CWE-285                                      |
| “Can access resource without correct role”  | Incorrect or missing permission check | CWE-285, 862, 863                            |

## Good Mapping Examples – Privileges & Permissions

* ✅ **CWE-266**: *“When a new user registers, the system assigns them admin role due to a missing role validation.”*
* ✅ **CWE-250**: *“Installer runs with system-level privileges but doesn't require them to install files in the user directory.”*
* ✅ **CWE-284**: *“Inconsistent access rules between UI and backend for sensitive endpoints.”*
* ✅ **CWE-285**: *“Authorization logic fails to restrict access to finance reports based on department.”*
