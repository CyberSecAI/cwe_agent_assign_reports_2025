  "query": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved libfs fix get_stashed_dentry() get_stashed_dentry() tries to optimistically retrieve a stashed dentry from a provided location. It needs to ensure to hold rcu lock before it dereference the stashed location to prevent UAF issues. Use rcu_dereference() instead of READ_ONCE() its effectively equivalent with some lockdep bells and whistles and it communicates clearly that this expects rcu protection.",
