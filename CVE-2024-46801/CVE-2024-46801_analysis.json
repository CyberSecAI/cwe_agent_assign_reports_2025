  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved libfs fix get_stashed_dentry() get_stashed_dentry() tries to optimistically retrieve a stashed dentry from a provided location. It needs to ensure to hold rcu lock before it dereference the stashed location to prevent UAF issues. Use rcu_dereference() instead of READ_ONCE() its effectively equivalent with some lockdep bells and whistles and it communicates clearly that this expects rcu protection.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n\nThe vulnerability lies in the `get_stashed_dentry()` function within the Linux kernel's libfs. This function attempts to retrieve a stashed dentry (directory entry) from a given memory location. The issue is that it was using `READ_ONCE()` to dereference the stashed location without holding the necessary RCU (Read-Copy-Update) lock. This can lead to a use-after-free (UAF) condition if the dentry is freed concurrently by another process.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n\n*   **Use-After-Free (UAF):** The primary vulnerability is a UAF. When `get_stashed_dentry()` accesses the stashed dentry using `READ_ONCE()` without RCU protection, it might be accessing memory that has already been freed.\n*   **Lack of RCU Protection:** The code was missing the necessary RCU lock to protect access to the stashed dentry. RCU is a synchronization mechanism used in the Linux kernel, where readers can access data without locks as long as they don't hold it for too long, but they need to use special RCU primitives.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Kernel Crash:** A UAF can lead to a kernel crash, causing a denial-of-service.\n*   **Potential for Privilege Escalation:** In some cases, a UAF can be exploited to gain arbitrary code execution in the kernel, potentially leading to privilege escalation.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   The vulnerability can be triggered by any code path that uses the `path_from_stashed` and `get_stashed_dentry` functions. This can be triggered via filesystem operations where dentries are stashed and reused.\n*   Specifically, it is triggered by concurrent access to stashed dentries where one thread frees the dentry while another attempts to use it.\n*   The syzbot reports indicate the vulnerability was found through fuzzing, which implies it can be triggered by crafting specific filesystem operations.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   An attacker would need the ability to trigger code paths that involve stashing and retrieving dentries.\n*   The attacker may need some level of privilege to perform file system operations that can trigger this vulnerability.\n*   Concurrency is crucial, so the attacker would need to trigger the vulnerability in a multi-threaded environment.\n*   Based on the syzbot report, no specific privileged capabilities beyond normal filesystem operation appears necessary.\n\n**Mitigation:**\n\nThe fix replaces `READ_ONCE(stashed)` with `rcu_dereference(*stashed)`. The `rcu_dereference` function ensures that the memory access is properly protected by the RCU mechanism.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n*   The provided commit messages and diffs are very detailed and provide a clear picture of the vulnerability and its fix.\n*   The vulnerability was reported and fixed quickly with commits 4e32c25b58b945f976435bbe51f39b32d714052e and 03e2a1209a83a380df34a72f7d6d1bc6c74132c7.\n*   The fix is relatively straightforward and addresses the root cause of the UAF vulnerability.",
