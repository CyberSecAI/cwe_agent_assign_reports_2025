  "description": "The WP Job Portal A Complete Recruitment System for Company or Job Board website plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the resumeid parameter in all versions up to, and including, 2.2.1 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-11711\n\n**Vulnerability:** Unauthenticated SQL Injection\n\n**Affected Software:** WP Job Portal WordPress plugin, versions up to and including 2.2.1\n\n**Root Cause:**\n*   The plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape the `resumeid` parameter in the `getAllResumeFiles` function within `/modules/resume/model.php`.\n*   The code directly concatenates user-supplied input into an SQL query without sufficient preparation.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is an SQL injection due to inadequate sanitization of the `resumeid` parameter, which is used in a database query to retrieve resume files.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can inject malicious SQL code to extract sensitive information from the database, including user data and other confidential details.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n*   **Network:** The attack is performed over the network by sending a crafted HTTP request to a vulnerable endpoint that utilizes the `resumeid` parameter.\n*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users, meaning that attackers do not need to have any existing credentials on the target system.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress site.\n*   No prior authentication or special privileges are needed.\n\n**Technical Details:**\n\n*   The vulnerable code snippet is located in the `resume_model.php` file, specifically in the `getAllResumeFiles()` function, where the `resumeid` parameter is used without proper sanitization.\n*   The SQL query that is vulnerable to injection is constructed using string concatenation involving the `resumeid` parameter received via `WPJOBPORTALrequest::getVar('resumeid')`.\n*   The Wordfence article specifically mentions that the issue is in all versions up to and including 2.2.1.\n*   The patch introduced in version 2.2.3 included input validation with `is_numeric()` checks on various parameters and proper sanitization using `esc_sql()`, as detailed in the diff on `plugins.trac.wordpress.org`.\n\n**Summary of Patch:**\nThe patch introduces input validation using `is_numeric()` before using user-provided parameters in SQL queries to prevent non-numeric input from causing SQL errors or enabling injection.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n*   The provided GitHub Gist shows the vulnerable `resume_model.php` file.\n*   The `plugins.trac.wordpress.org` link provides a detailed comparison between the vulnerable version (2.2.2) and the patched version (2.2.3), highlighting the changes that were made to address the injection.\n*   The vulnerability is related to improper handling of user input, which allows for SQL injection.",

Several other CWEs were considered based on retriever results (CWE-116, CWE-472), but they are related to encoding/escaping and external control of parameters, which are contributing factors but not the direct root cause. The abstraction level of CWE-89 as \"Base\" is appropriate as it directly represents the **improper neutralization** issue.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    \n    cwe89 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe89 primary\n    class cwe74 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **insufficient escaping** of the `resumeid` parameter. This leads to **improper neutralization** of special elements, ultimately resulting in **SQL Injection**, which can then be exploited by attackers to **extract sensitive information from the database**.\n- **Root Cause:** Insufficient Escaping (Implicit in CWE-89)\n- **Weakness:** CWE-89 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n- **Impact:** Information Disclosure\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly pointed to CWE-89, and a review of the vulnerability description and supporting CVE details confirmed this assessment. The vulnerability is a direct result of **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL commands.\n\nThe relationship analysis highlights the parent-child relationship between CWE-89 and higher-level injection CWEs.
