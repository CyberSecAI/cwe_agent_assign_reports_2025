# Analysis Report for CVE-2024-11711

# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-11711

## Description

The WP Job Portal A Complete Recruitment System for Company or Job Board website plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the resumeid parameter in all versions up to, and including, 2.2.1 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Rootcause:** insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query
- **Weakness:** SQL injection
- **Impact:** extract sensitive information from the database
- **Attacker:** unauthenticated attackers
- **Product:** WP Job Portal A Complete Recruitment System for Company or Job Board website plugin for WordPress

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary

| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-89 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') | 1.0 | Base | Primary CWE | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that influenced the decision was the direct match of the vulnerability to the description of CWE-89. Several other CWEs were considered based on retriever results (CWE-116, CWE-472), but they are related to encoding/escaping and external control of parameters, which are contributing factors but not the direct root cause. The abstraction level of CWE-89 as "Base" is appropriate as it directly represents the **improper neutralization** issue.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **insufficient escaping** of the `resumeid` parameter. This leads to **improper neutralization** of special elements, ultimately resulting in **SQL Injection**, which can then be exploited by attackers to **extract sensitive information from the database**.
- **Root Cause:** Insufficient Escaping (Implicit in CWE-89)
- **Weakness:** CWE-89 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')
- **Impact:** Information Disclosure

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis strongly pointed to CWE-89, and a review of the vulnerability description and supporting CVE details confirmed this assessment. The vulnerability is a direct result of **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL commands.

The relationship analysis highlights the parent-child relationship between CWE-89 and higher-level injection CWEs. However, CWE-89 is the most specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability. The choice of CWE-89 is based on the following evidence:

-   The **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases** clearly states **SQL injection** as a weakness.
-   The **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** notes that the plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape the `resumeid` parameter and directly concatenates user-supplied input into an SQL query without sufficient preparation, directly causing SQL injection.
-   The root cause is listed as **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**.

The selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly addresses the **improper neutralization** of SQL special elements.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
**Abstraction Level**: Compound
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.

*Not Used:* CSRF is not applicable as this vulnerability is due to SQL Injection, not a forgery of requests.

## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Used:* While the `resumeid` is externally controlled, the core issue is the lack of proper sanitization leading to SQL injection, not merely the external control of the parameter itself.

## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component. Without sufficient removal or quoting of SQL syntax in user-controllable inputs, the generated SQL query can cause those inputs to be interpreted as SQL instead of ordinary user data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Used:* This is the primary CWE as the vulnerability involves the construction of an SQL command using external input without proper neutralization.

## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Used:* The vulnerability is not related to authorization issues.

## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

*Not Used:* While **insufficient escaping** contributes to the vulnerability, the direct consequence is SQL Injection due to improper neutralization.

## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Used:* This is not related to file uploads.

## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Used:* The vulnerability is not related to authorization bypass.

## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Used:* While information is disclosed, the primary issue is SQL injection.

## CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently ensuring that the resulting data will be valid.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Used:* This is not related to deserialization.
