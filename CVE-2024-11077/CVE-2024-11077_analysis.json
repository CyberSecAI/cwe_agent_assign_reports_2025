  "description": "A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, was found in code-projects Job Recruitment 1.0. Affected is an unknown function of the file /index.php. The manipulation of the argument email leads to **sql injection**. It is possible to launch the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nThe root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in the `index.php` file of the \"Job-recruitment-in-php\" application. Specifically, the `$email` parameter from user input is directly concatenated into an SQL query without any filtering or escaping.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. By manipulating the `$email` parameter, an attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code into the database query.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Data Breach:** An attacker can potentially extract sensitive data from the database, including user credentials, personal information, and other confidential data.\n- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** In some cases, SQL injection can be leveraged to execute arbitrary commands on the server, leading to a complete system compromise.\n- **Database Manipulation:** An attacker can modify or delete data in the database, leading to data corruption or loss of service.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is exploited via a POST request to the `index.php` file.\n- **Manipulated `$email` Parameter:** The attacker injects malicious SQL code into the `$email` parameter within the POST request.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable server.\n- **Understanding of SQL Injection:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL injection techniques to craft malicious payloads.\n- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability is present in `index.php`, which based on the description, can be accessed without any prior authentication.\n\n**Additional Details:**\nThe provided content includes a Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrating how to exploit the SQL injection vulnerability using `sqlmap`. The POC shows how to retrieve database information using a crafted HTTP POST request.\n\nThe content also references the following:\n*   **Vulnerable File:** index.php\n*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** $email\n*   **Supplier:**  `https://code-projects.org/job-recruitment-in-php-css-javascript-and-mysql-free-download/`\n\nThis information provides a good overview of the SQL injection vulnerability.",
