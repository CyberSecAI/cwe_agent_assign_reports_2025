The manipulation of the argument email leads to **sql injection**. It is possible to launch the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **sql injection**
- **product:** code-projects Job Recruitment
- **version:** 1.0
- **component:** /index.php

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in the `index.php` file of the "Job-recruitment-in-php" application. Specifically, the `$email` parameter from user input is directly concatenated into an SQL query without any filtering or escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. By manipulating the `$email` parameter, an attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code into the database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker can potentially extract sensitive data from the database, including user credentials, personal information, and other confidential data.
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** In some cases, SQL injection can be leveraged to execute arbitrary commands on the server, leading to a complete system compromise.
- **Database Manipulation:** An attacker can modify or delete data in the database, leading to data corruption or loss of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is exploited via a POST request to the `index.php` file.
- **Manipulated `$email` Parameter:** The attacker injects malicious SQL code into the `$email` parameter within the POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable server.
- **Understanding of SQL Injection:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL injection techniques to craft malicious payloads.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability is present in `index.php`, which based on the description, can be accessed without any prior authentication.

**Additional Details:**
The provided content includes a Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrating how to exploit the SQL injection vulnerability using `sqlmap`. The POC shows how to retrieve database information using a crafted HTTP POST request.

The content also references the following:
