# Analysis Report for CVE-2025-24946

# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2025-24946

## Description

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Rootcause:** weak hash function
- **Impact:** ['DoS attack', 'CPU load']
- **Vector:** colliding Source Connection IDs
- **Attacker:** remote attackers
- **Product:** picoquic
- **Version:** before b80fd3f
- **Component:** hash table to manage connections

# Summary
| CWE ID  | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------|------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|

*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that influenced the decision was the parent-child relationship between CWE-327 (Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm), a Class, and CWE-328 (Use of Weak Hash), a Base. Because the description specifically mentions a **weak hash function**, CWE-328 is more specific and thus more appropriate. CWE-407 (Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity) is a related Class-level CWE that describes the impact of using a weak hash, causing a DoS.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the use of a **weak hash function** (CWE-328), leading to hash collisions. These collisions cause the hash table to perform inefficiently, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to the increased CPU load (CWE-407).

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis strongly points to CWE-328 (Use of Weak Hash) as the primary root cause. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions the use of a **weak hash function**. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" section confirms this by stating, "Hash Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks exploit the algorithmic complexity of hash tables when pushing them to their worst-case complexity. This is due to the use of weak hash functions, which allows for easy collisions." This evidence supports the selection of CWE-328.

CWE-407 (Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity) was also considered because the attack results in a DoS due to the inefficient hash table performance, but this is a consequence of the root cause (weak hash).

The final decision is to assign CWE-328 as the primary CWE because it directly addresses the root cause, which is the use of a **weak hash function**. CWE-407 is considered as a secondary candidate due to the impact on performance, but is not the primary root cause.

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
An algorithm in a product has an inefficient worst-case computational complexity that may be detrimental to system performance and can be triggered by an attacker, typically using crafted manipulations that ensure that the worst case is being reached.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses an algorithm that produces a digest (output value) that does not meet security expectations for a hash function that allows an adversary to reasonably determine the original input (preimage attack), find another input that can produce the same hash (2nd preimage attack), or find multiple inputs that evaluate to the same hash (birthday attack).

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-617: Reachable Assertion
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product contains an assert() or similar statement that can be triggered by an attacker, which leads to an application exit or other behavior that is more severe than necessary.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-208: Observable Timing Discrepancy
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
Two separate operations in a product require different amounts of time to complete, in a way that is observable to an actor and reveals security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not check or incorrectly checks for unusual or exceptional conditions that are not expected to occur frequently during day to day operation of the product.

## CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-346: Origin Validation Error
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly verify that the source of data or communication is valid.

## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
