# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-54804

## Description

Netgear WNR854T 1.5.2 (North America) is vulnerable to **Command Injection**. An attacker can send a specially crafted request to post.cgi, updating the nvram parameter wan_hostname and forcing a reboot. This will result in command injection.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Weakness:** Command Injection
- **Vector:** specially crafted request
- **Product:** Netgear WNR854T
- **Version:** 1.5.2
- **Component:** post.cgi

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-78 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') | 1.0 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-1287 | Improper Validation of Specified Type of Input | 0.7 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is **CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')**, which is a base-level CWE. CWE-78 is a child of CWE-77 (Class) and CWE-74 (Class) and CWE-138 (Class). **CWE-1287: Improper Validation of Specified Type of Input** is considered as a contributing factor since the **lack of input validation** leads to the command injection. It is a base level CWE.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain begins with the **lack of input validation (CWE-1287)** on the `wan_hostname` parameter. This leads to **CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')**, where an attacker can inject arbitrary commands into the system by exploiting the absence of proper sanitization. The final impact is complete compromise of the router.

## Summary of Analysis
The primary CWE is **CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')** because the **lack of input validation** on the `wan_hostname` parameter allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary commands. This is supported by the "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" which states "The root cause is the absence of input validation or sanitization for the `wan_hostname` parameter when constructing a shell command."

**CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')** was considered, but CWE-78 is more specific since the commands are OS commands. The retriever results listed CWE-77 with the highest score, however, the vulnerability description key phrases list "Command Injection" which is a general term. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary describes the vulnerability as affecting the routerâ€™s WAN hostname configuration and affecting the sysinit binary, which suggests OS commands are being executed.

**CWE-1287: Improper Validation of Specified Type of Input** was considered as a secondary CWE because the root cause includes the **lack of input validation**.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-78 is a Base level CWE, and accurately represents the vulnerability.

Relevant CWE Information:
- CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')
- CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')
- CWE-1287: Improper Validation of Specified Type of Input
