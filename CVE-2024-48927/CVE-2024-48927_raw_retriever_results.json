There is a potential risk of code execution for Backoffice users when they preview SVG files in full screen mode. Versions 13.5.2, 10.8,7, and 8.18.15 contain a patch for the issue. As a workaround, derver-side file validation is available to strip script tags from files content during the file upload process.",
