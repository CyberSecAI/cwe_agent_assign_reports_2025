# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-38499
## Query
CA Client Automation (ITCM) allows non-admin/non-root users to encrypt a string using CAF CLI and SD_ACMD CLI. This would allow the non admin user to access the critical encryption keys which further causes the exploitation of stored credentials. This fix doesnt allow a non-admin/non-root user to execute caf encrypt/sd_acmd encrypt commands.
