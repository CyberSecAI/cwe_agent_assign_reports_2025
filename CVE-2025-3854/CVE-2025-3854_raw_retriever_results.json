  "query": "A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, was found in H3C GR-3000AX up to V100R006. Affected is the function EnableIpv6/UpdateWanModeMulti/UpdateIpv6Params/EditWlanMacList/Edit_List_SSID of the file /goform/aspForm of the component HTTP POST Request Handler. The manipulation of the argument param leads to buffer overflow. The attack needs to be initiated within the local network. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component. Other functions might be affected as well.",
