  "description": "A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, was found in H3C GR-3000AX up to V100R006. Affected is the function EnableIpv6/UpdateWanModeMulti/UpdateIpv6Params/EditWlanMacList/Edit_List_SSID of the file /goform/aspForm of the component HTTP POST Request Handler. The manipulation of the argument param leads to **buffer overflow**. The attack needs to be initiated within the local network. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component. Other functions might be affected as well.",

Matches the description of the vulnerability due to the **buffer overflow** caused by the manipulation of the param argument. |\n| CWE-119 | Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer | 0.6 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary candidate. This is a more general case of buffer overflow. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship of interest is the parent-child relationship between CWE-119 and CWE-120. CWE-120 is a specific type of CWE-119. While CWE-119 is a broader class describing improper restrictions within memory buffers, CWE-120 pinpoints the specific issue of copying a buffer without validating its size. Since the vulnerability description mentions \"**buffer overflow**\" caused by manipulating the `param` argument, CWE-120 is a more precise fit.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe120[\"CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n\n    cwe120 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe120 primary\n    class cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of input validation** on the `param` argument within the HTTP POST request handler. This leads to a **buffer copy operation without proper size checking**, resulting in a **buffer overflow**. The impact is potential code execution or denial of service.\n  - **Root Cause:** **Lack of input validation** on the `param` argument\n  - **Weakness:** CWE-120 Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input\n  - **Impact:** Code execution or denial of service\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis strongly indicates that CWE-120 is the most appropriate mapping for this vulnerability. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions a **buffer overflow** due to the manipulation of the `param` argument. The retriever results also list CWE-120 as a strong candidate. While CWE-119 is a parent class, CWE-120 provides a more specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability.\n\nThe decision is based on the following evidence:\n- \"The manipulation of the argument param leads to **buffer overflow**.\"\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the selection by highlighting the hierarchical relationship between CWE-119 and CWE-120, allowing for a more precise choice.\n\nCWE-120 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the root cause: copying a buffer without checking the size of the input, which causes the **buffer overflow**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-134: Use of Externally-Controlled Format String\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a function that accepts a format string as an argument, but the format string originates from an external source.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected*: This CWE is not suitable, as there is no indication of format string usage.\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected*: This CWE is not suitable, as there is no indication of incorrect calculation of the buffer size.\n\n## CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA stack-based buffer overflow condition is a condition where the buffer being overwritten is allocated on the stack (i.e., is a local variable or, rarely, a parameter to a function).\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected*: This CWE could be possible, but there is not enough information to determine where the buffer is allocated, so a more general CWE is preferred.\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).

This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-119 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available.\n\n*Selected as Secondary*: This is a more general case of buffer overflow.\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected*: This CWE is not suitable, as there is no indication of exposure of sensitive system information.\n\n## CWE-790: Improper Filtering of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives data from an upstream component, but does not filter or incorrectly filters special elements before sending it to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not Selected*: This CWE is not suitable because the vulnerability is a **buffer overflow**, and there is no mention of special elements.\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected*: This CWE is not suitable because the vulnerability is a **buffer overflow**, not related to immutable web parameters.\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base",
