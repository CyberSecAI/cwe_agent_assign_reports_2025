CWE-497 can be a parent of other CWEs such as CWE-200.\nCWE-200 is a Class-level CWE and is a parent of CWE-209, CWE-532, CWE-1295.

The **impact** is that an attacker could obtain information to launch further attacks.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment considered CWE-200 due to the **impact** of the vulnerability being information exposure. However, upon closer inspection, the root cause is the **disclosure of sensitive configuration information**, making CWE-497 a more accurate fit. CWE-497 focuses on the exposure of system-level information, which aligns well with the vulnerability description. The relationship graph shows that CWE-200 is a child of CWE-497, indicating that the exposure of sensitive information is a consequence of the system information exposure.\n\nThe evidence for this assessment is primarily based on the vulnerability description, which states that the vulnerability could allow **disclosure of sensitive configuration information**. However, evidence is low since the CVE Reference Links Content Summary is unrelated.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-200 is commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error.
