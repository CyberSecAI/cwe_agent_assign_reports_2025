- **impact:** heap over-read
- **product:** Samsung Mobile Processor Exynos Wearable Processor and Exynos 980 and Exynos 850 and Exynos 1080 and Exynos 1280 and Exynos 1380 and Exynos 1330 and Exynos 1480 and Exynos W920 and Exynos W930
- **component:** slsi_rx_scan_ind() function

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-27367:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the `slsi_rx_roamed_ind()` function.
- The function lacks input validation for the length parameter received from userspace.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap Over-read:** The primary vulnerability is a heap over-read. Due to the missing length validation, the function might attempt to read beyond the allocated buffer on the heap.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The code fails to validate the length of data received from the userspace, allowing potentially malicious data to be processed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Potential Information Disclosure:** A successful heap over-read could expose sensitive data residing in memory beyond the intended buffer. The overread can possibly lead to arbitrary code execution

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the userspace interface, by sending crafted data with a malicious length parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to send data to the `slsi_rx_roamed_ind()` function via the userspace interface. This implies the attacker must have some level of access to the system to interact with this interface.

**Affected Products:**
- Exynos 980
- Exynos 850
- Exynos 1080
- Exynos 1280
- Exynos 1380
- Exynos 1330
- Exynos 1480
- Exynos W920
- Exynos W930

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was reported on 2024-02-04 and acknowledged by "jiayy".
- The severity is classified as "Medium".
