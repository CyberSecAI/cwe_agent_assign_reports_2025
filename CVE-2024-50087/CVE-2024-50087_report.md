# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-50087

## Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved btrfs fix **uninitialized pointer free** on read_alloc_one_name() error The function read_alloc_one_name() does not initialize the name field of the passed fscrypt_str struct if kmalloc fails to allocate the corresponding buffer. Thus, it is not guaranteed that fscrypt_str.name is initialized when freeing it. This is a follow-up to the linked patch that fixes the remaining instances of the bug introduced by commit e43eec81c516 (btrfs use struct qstr instead of name and namelen pairs).

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Rootcause:** uninitialized pointer free
- **Product:** Linux kernel
- **Component:** read_alloc_one_name() function in btrfs

## Relationship Analysis

The primary relationship is that CWE-824 (Access of Uninitialized Pointer) is a specific type of CWE-908 (Use of Uninitialized Resource), which in turn is related to CWE-909 (Missing Initialization of Resource). The root cause is the missing initialization, which leads to the use of an uninitialized resource, and in this specific case, that resource is a pointer. Selecting CWE-824 provides the most specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability.

## Vulnerability Chain

The vulnerability chain starts with **missing initialization** of the `name` field in the `fscrypt_str` struct (CWE-909). This leads to the **use of an uninitialized resource** (CWE-908), specifically an **uninitialized pointer** (CWE-824). When the code attempts to free this uninitialized pointer, it results in a use-after-free condition.

## Summary of Analysis

The analysis is based on the vulnerability description and the provided CVE reference. The key evidence lies in the statement that the `read_alloc_one_name()` function "does not initialize the name field" and that "it is not guaranteed that fscrypt_str.name is initialized when freeing it." This directly points to an **uninitialized pointer free**, confirming CWE-824 as the most specific and accurate classification.

The graph relationships support this by showing how the missing initialization leads to the use of an uninitialized pointer. The selection of CWE-824 over its parent CWE-908 is justified because the description explicitly mentions a pointer being uninitialized.

The retriever results also indicate that CWE-824, CWE-908 and CWE-909 are highly relevant.
