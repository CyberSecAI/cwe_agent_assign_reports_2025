CWE-306 is a child of CWE-287, indicating that the missing authentication is a specific type of improper authentication. Since the description highlights a **missing authentication** for a critical function, CWE-306 is more appropriate.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    \n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe306 primary\n    class cwe287 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authentication** for the `LoadUrl` function. This allows an attacker to bypass authentication and access sensitive functionalities.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified the **improper authentication** as a key weakness. The supporting evidence from the CVE reference links confirms that the `Jump` function is not properly authenticated, allowing for permission bypass by setting a specific cookie value. The retriever results also include CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) and CWE-287 (Improper Authentication), with CWE-306 being more relevant due to the explicit absence of authentication. The CWE classification guidance further supports this, emphasizing the distinction between missing authentication (CWE-306) and improper authorization (CWE-862, CWE-863).\n\nThe selection of CWE-306 is based on the explicit evidence of **missing authentication** for a critical function. The evidence from the github.com content clearly states that the `Jump` function under `hfish-master \\view\\login\\ View.go` is not properly authenticated, leading to permission bypass. The attack involves setting the `is_login` cookie to \"admin\" to bypass authentication.\n\n# Relevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWEs Considered But Not Used\n*   CWE-287: Improper Authentication - While this is a parent of CWE-306, CWE-306 is more specific because the core issue is the complete absence of authentication, not merely an improperly implemented authentication mechanism.\n*   CWE-862: Missing Authorization - The issue here is not about missing authorization checks after authentication, but the lack of authentication itself.\n*   CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization - This is not applicable because there is no authorization check to be incorrect; authentication is entirely missing.\n*   CWE-79, CWE-78, CWE-73, CWE-93, CWE-117, CWE-201, CWE-41: These are all injection-related or information leakage CWEs and are not relevant to the **missing authentication** issue described in the vulnerability.",

        "extended_description": "\n\nThis weakness can lead to a vulnerability in environments in which the attacker does not have direct access to the operating system, such as in web applications. Alternately, if the weakness occurs in a privileged program, it could allow the attacker to specify commands that normally would not be accessible, or to call alternate commands with privileges that the attacker does not have. The problem is exacerbated if the compromised process does not follow the principle of least privilege, because the attacker-controlled commands may run with special system privileges that increases the amount of damage.\n\n\nThere are at least two subtypes of OS command injection:\n\n\n  - The application intends to execute a single, fixed program that is under its own control. It intends to use externally-supplied inputs as arguments to that program. For example, the program might use system(\"nslookup [HOSTNAME]\") to run nslookup and allow the user to supply a HOSTNAME, which is used as an argument. Attackers cannot prevent nslookup from executing. However, if the program does not remove command separators from the HOSTNAME argument, attackers could place the separators into the arguments, which allows them to execute their own program after nslookup has finished executing.\n\n  - The application accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run, as well as which commands to use. The application simply redirects this entire command to the operating system. For example, the program might use \"exec([COMMAND])\" to execute the [COMMAND] that was supplied by the user. If the COMMAND is under attacker control, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or programs. If the command is being executed using functions like exec() and CreateProcess(), the attacker might not be able to combine multiple commands together in the same line.\n\nFrom a weakness standpoint, these variants represent distinct programmer errors. In the first variant, the programmer clearly intends that input from untrusted parties will be part of the arguments in the command to be executed. In the second variant, the programmer does not intend for the command to be accessible to any untrusted party, but the programmer probably has not accounted for alternate ways in which malicious attackers can provide input.",
