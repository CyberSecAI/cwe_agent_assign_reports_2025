While CWE-77 is more general, the vulnerability description specifies that the **command injection** occurs at the OS level, making CWE-78 a more precise and appropriate choice.

The core issue is the **improper neutralization** of special elements, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary commands.\n\nThe selection of CWE-78 is primarily based on the following evidence:\n\n*   Vulnerability Description: \"Tenda W20E V15.11.0.6 was found to contain a **command injection vulnerability** in the formSetDebugCfg function via the level parameter.\"\n\nThis statement directly points to **command injection**.\n\n*   CWE-78 Description: \"The product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.\"\n\nThis description aligns perfectly with the vulnerability, where the `formSetDebugCfg` function constructs an OS command without properly neutralizing special elements, leading to command execution.\n\nOther CWEs Considered:\n\n*   CWE-77 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')): This is a broader class of command injection. Since the vulnerability specifically involves OS commands, CWE-78 is a more precise choice.\n*   CWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')): This is specific to SQL injection, which is not relevant to the described vulnerability.\n*   CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')): This is specific to Cross-site Scripting, which is not relevant to the described vulnerability.\n\nThe provided evidence strongly supports the selection of CWE-78 as the primary CWE.
