# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-38514

## Description

NextChat is a cross-platform ChatGPT/Gemini UI. There is a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability due to a lack of validation of the `endpoint` GET parameter on the WebDav API endpoint. This SSRF can be used to perform arbitrary HTTPS request from the vulnerable instance (MKCOL, PUT and GET methods supported), or to target NextChat users and make them execute arbitrary JavaScript code in their browser. This vulnerability has been patched in version 2.12.4.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Rootcause:** lack of validation of the endpoint GET parameter on the WebDav API endpoint
- **Weakness:** server-side request forgery
- **Impact:** execute arbitrary JavaScript code in browser
- **Product:** NextChat
- **Version:** prior to 2.12.4
- **Component:** WebDav API endpoint

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary

| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-918 | Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) | 1.0 | Base |  Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-79 | Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') | 0.7 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship influencing the CWE selection is the direct match of the vulnerability description to the characteristics of CWE-918. The vulnerability involves a server receiving a URL from a user-controlled source (`endpoint` GET parameter) and making a request to that URL without proper validation.

CWE-79 is a secondary concern because the SSRF vulnerability allows for the injection of arbitrary Javascript code.

```

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain begins with the **lack of validation** of the `endpoint` GET parameter, leading to a Server-Side Request Forgery (CWE-918). This SSRF can then be exploited to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser, resulting in Cross-Site Scripting (CWE-79).

## Summary of Analysis
The primary vulnerability is clearly a Server-Side Request Forgery (CWE-918) due to the **lack of validation** of the `endpoint` parameter. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability due to a **lack of validation of the `endpoint` GET parameter** on the WebDav API endpoint." The retriever results also strongly suggest CWE-918 as the primary candidate. The evidence for this is strong.

The ability to inject arbitrary JavaScript code is a consequence of the SSRF, which allows the attacker to control the content served to the user's browser. This makes CWE-79 a secondary concern.

The chosen CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-918 is a Base-level CWE that accurately describes the root cause of the vulnerability.
CWE-79 is a base level CWE that accurately describes the impact of the vulnerability, which is the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser.

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web server receives a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-93: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses CRLF (carriage return line feeds) as a special element, e.g. to separate lines or records, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CRLF sequences from inputs.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-346: Origin Validation Error
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly verify that the source of data or communication is valid.
