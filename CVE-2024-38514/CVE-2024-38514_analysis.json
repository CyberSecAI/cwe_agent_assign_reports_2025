  "description": "NextChat is a cross-platform ChatGPT/Gemini UI. There is a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability due to a lack of validation of the `endpoint` GET parameter on the WebDav API endpoint. This SSRF can be used to perform arbitrary HTTPS request from the vulnerable instance (MKCOL, PUT and GET methods supported), or to target NextChat users and make them execute arbitrary JavaScript code in their browser. This vulnerability has been patched in version 2.12.4.",

    "version": "prior to 2.12.4",
    "component": "WebDav API endpoint"
  },
  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from an insufficient validation of the `endpoint` GET parameter within the WebDav API endpoint. The application uses `startsWith()` to check if the provided URL matches a list of allowed domains. This check is inadequate because it does not enforce a trailing slash or specific folder within the allowed domains, allowing an attacker to bypass the SSRF protection.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n\n*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The application makes HTTP requests to a URL specified by the user without proper validation, leading to an SSRF vulnerability.\n*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The ability to make arbitrary HTTPS requests, combined with a lack of output sanitization, allows attackers to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Arbitrary HTTPS Requests:** Attackers can force the server to make requests to any URL, potentially exposing internal resources or interacting with other services on the network.\n*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** By hosting malicious JavaScript code on an attacker-controlled server, the attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser within the vulnerable instance's context.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   The vulnerability is triggered by sending a GET request to the `/api/webdav/[...path]/route.ts` endpoint with a crafted `endpoint` parameter.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.\n*   The attacker needs to control a server to host a payload for XSS.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n*   The application checks if a given URL starts with an allowed domain, but this check is not sufficient to prevent SSRF due to the lack of trailing slash enforcement.\n*   The vulnerability exists in versions <= 2.12.3 of `chatgpt-next-web`.\n*   The vulnerability is fixed in version 2.12.4 by implementing more robust URL validation.\n\n**Code Snippets:**\n*   **Vulnerable Code:** The vulnerability lies in the endpoint validation logic within `app/api/webdav/[...path]/route.ts`. The code uses a `startsWith()` check against a list of allowed domains.\n*   **Allowed Domains:** The list of allowed WebDav domains is defined in `app/constant.ts`.\n\n**CVSS Metrics:**\n*   CVSS Score: 7.4 (High)\n*   CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N\n\n**CWEs:**\n*   CWE-79: Cross-site Scripting\n*   CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery\n\nThis information is more detailed than a typical CVE description and provides specific code locations and attack vectors.",

The vulnerability involves a server receiving a URL from a user-controlled source (`endpoint` GET parameter) and making a request to that URL without proper validation.\n\nCWE-79 is a secondary concern because the SSRF vulnerability allows for the injection of arbitrary Javascript code.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe918[\"CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    \n    cwe79 -->|CAUSED_BY| cwe918\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe918 primary\n    class cwe79 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the **lack of validation** of the `endpoint` GET parameter, leading to a Server-Side Request Forgery (CWE-918). This SSRF can then be exploited to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser, resulting in Cross-Site Scripting (CWE-79).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary vulnerability is clearly a Server-Side Request Forgery (CWE-918) due to the **lack of validation** of the `endpoint` parameter. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability due to a **lack of validation of the `endpoint` GET parameter** on the WebDav API endpoint.\" The retriever results also strongly suggest CWE-918 as the primary candidate. The evidence for this is strong.\n\nThe ability to inject arbitrary JavaScript code is a consequence of the SSRF, which allows the attacker to control the content served to the user's browser. This makes CWE-79 a secondary concern.\n\nThe chosen CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity.
