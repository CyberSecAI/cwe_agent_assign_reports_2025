# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-4767

## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability was found in defog-ai introspect up to 0.1.4. It has been rated as critical. Affected by this issue is the function test_custom_tool of the file introspect/backend/integration_routes.py of the component Test Endpoint. The manipulation of the argument input_model leads to code injection. Attacking locally is a requirement. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **component:** Test Endpoint in introspect/backend/integration_routes.py
- **vector:** input_model argument manipulation
- **weakness:** **code injection, vulnerability**
- **product:** defog-ai introspect
- **version:** up to 0.1.4

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-4767 Content

The provided content is **RELATED** to a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability. It provides significantly more detail than a typical CVE description would.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause is the use of `exec(request.input_model, namespace)` in the `/custom_tools/test` endpoint without proper sanitization of the `input_model` parameter.  Despite attempting to restrict execution using a namespace containing only `BaseModel` and `Field`, the `exec()` context allows attackers to bypass these restrictions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Unsafe use of `exec()`:**  Executing arbitrary user-supplied code using `exec()` is inherently dangerous.
*   **Namespace bypass:** The namespace restriction is insufficient to prevent code injection and execution of arbitrary commands.  Attackers can use `__import__` or `eval` to load forbidden modules.
*   **Arbitrary Code Injection:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary Python code.

**Impact of exploitation:**

Successful exploitation leads to **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**, granting the attacker full control over the server's environment with the serverâ€™s privileges.

**Attack vectors:**

*   An attacker can craft a malicious `input_model` payload containing arbitrary Python code.
*   The payload is sent to the `/custom_tools/test` endpoint.
*   The `exec()` function executes the malicious code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the `/custom_tools/test` endpoint. No authentication is mentioned as a requirement in the provided text.
*   The attacker needs to understand Python and be able to craft a malicious payload that bypasses the namespace restrictions.

**Mitigation or fix:**

The content does not explicitly state a fix, but it implies that avoiding the use of `exec()` with user-supplied input is the primary mitigation.  Alternatively, a much more robust and secure input validation and sanitization mechanism would be required if `exec()` is absolutely necessary. The pull request #501 is mentioned as closing the issue, suggesting a fix was implemented.

**Affected versions:**

*   v0.1.0 to v0.1.4
*   The latest main branch also contains the vulnerability.

**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**

*   The content provides a concrete example of a malicious payload.
*   It explains *how* the namespace bypass works, detailing the use of `__import__` and other techniques.
*   It points to the specific line of code in `tool_routes.py` where the vulnerability exists.
*   It provides a link to the commit where the vulnerable code was introduced.
