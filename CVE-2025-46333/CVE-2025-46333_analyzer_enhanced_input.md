## Vulnerability Description
z2d is a pure Zig 2D graphics library. Versions of z2d after `0.5.1` and up to and including `0.6.0`, when writing from one surface to another using `z2d.compositor.StrideCompositor.run`, and higher-level operations when the anti-aliasing mode is set to `.default` (such as `Context.fill`, `Context.stroke`, `painter.fill`, and `painter.stroke`), the source surface can be completely out-of-bounds on the x-axis, but not on the y-axis, by way of a negative offset. This results in an **overflow of the value controlling the length of the stride**. In non-safe optimization modes (consumers compiling with `ReleaseFast` or `ReleaseSmall`), this could potentially lead to invalid memory accesses or corruption. This issue is patched in version `0.6.1`. Users on an untagged version after `v0.5.1` and before `v0.6.1` are advised to update to address the vulnerability. Those still on Zig `0.13.0` are recommended to downgrade to `v0.5.1`.

Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to the potential vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause is an out-of-bounds (OOB) composition issue when writing one surface to another using `z2d.compositor.SurfaceCompositor.run`. Specifically, it occurs when the source surface is completely out-of-bounds on the x-axis (but not the y-axis) due to a negative offset, leading to an overflow in the stride length calculation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds write:** The core issue is an out-of-bounds write condition.
*   **Integer overflow:** A negative offset causes an integer overflow when calculating the stride length.
*   **Memory corruption/Invalid memory access:** In non-safe optimization modes (`ReleaseFast` or `ReleaseSmall`), this can lead to invalid memory access or corruption.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Invalid memory access:** Potential for the program to access memory it shouldn't.
*   **Memory corruption:** Data in memory could be overwritten, leading to unpredictable behavior.

**Attack vectors:**

*   Creating a scenario where a source surface is positioned out-of-bounds on the x-axis during composition.
*   Using higher-level operations like `Context.fill`, `Context.stroke`, `painter.fill`, and `painter.stroke` with the default anti-aliasing mode, which internally use `SurfaceCompositor.run`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to control the input data or surface parameters to create the out-of-bounds condition.
*   Local access is sufficient to exploit the vulnerability.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   Updating to version 0.6.1 of the `z2d` library.
*   Downgrading to v0.5.1 if still using Zig 0.13.0.
*   The fix involves ensuring that the compositor handles out-of-bounds conditions correctly, preventing the negative offset from causing an overflow.

**Additional Details (more detail than official CVE description):**

*   The issue was introduced around commit `7617190e59875415df88bc1d82b465949d154d98`.
*   The vulnerability is related to how the mask is constructed in higher-level operations when anti-aliasing is enabled.
*   The provided test case demonstrates the vulnerability.
*   CVSS v4 score: 7.3/10.
*   CVSS Vector: CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:H/AT:P/PR:L/UI:P/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:H/SI:H/SA:H
