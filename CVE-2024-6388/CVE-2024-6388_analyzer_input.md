- **product:** Ubuntu Advantage Desktop Daemon
- **version:** before version 1.12

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2024-6388.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `ubuntu-advantage-desktop-daemon` was passing the Ubuntu Pro attach token as a command-line argument to the `pro` client. This exposed the token to any user on the system who could use `ps` or similar tools to view process arguments.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Exposure:** The primary vulnerability was the exposure of the sensitive attach token via command-line arguments.
- **Lack of Secure Handling of Sensitive Data:**  The application failed to handle the token securely, leading to its exposure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access/Privilege Escalation:** An attacker who obtained the token could use it to attach to the Ubuntu Pro service with the permissions associated with the leaked token. This could lead to unauthorized access or privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Process Monitoring:** An attacker with local access to the system could monitor the running processes and their arguments to extract the attach token. This could be achieved using common tools like `ps`.
- **Command Injection (Potentially):** Although not directly stated in the provided content, a potential attack vector could be a command injection vulnerability if the token was used unsafely in a command execution, although this wasn't stated as part of the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local System Access:**  An attacker needs to have at least local access to the system where the vulnerable daemon is running.
- **Ability to Monitor Processes:** The attacker needs to have the ability to monitor processes and read their command-line arguments. Standard user privileges are sufficient to achieve this.

**Mitigation:**
The vulnerability was mitigated by changing the way the attach token is passed to the `pro` client. Instead of using command-line arguments, the token is now passed via a private temporary configuration file, which has read/write permissions only for the user running the process, thus preventing other users from accessing the token.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix was implemented in the `ubuntu-advantage-desktop-daemon` version 1.12.
- The issue was tracked in Launchpad as bug #2068944.
- The fix was implemented by passing the token via a temporary attach config file with restrictive permissions.
- The initial report mentioned that passing the token via environment variable might be better but the temporary file approach was chosen.
