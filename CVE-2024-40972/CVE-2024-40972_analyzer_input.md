# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-40972

## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ext4 do not create EA inode under buffer lock **ext4_xattr_set_entry() creates new EA inodes while holding buffer lock** on the external xattr block. This is problematic as it nests all the allocation locking (which acquires locks on other buffers) under the buffer lock. This can even deadlock when the filesystem is corrupted and e.g. quota file is setup to contain xattr block as data block. Move the allocation of EA inode out of ext4_xattr_set_entry() into the callers.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **ext4_xattr_set_entry() creates new EA inodes while holding buffer lock**
- **weakness:** **improper locking**
- **impact:** deadlock
- **vector:** filesystem corruption
- **product:** Linux kernel
- **component:** ext4

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability addressed by the commits, which all relate to the same underlying issue:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the `ext4_xattr_set_entry()` function within the Linux kernel's ext4 filesystem driver. This function was creating new extended attribute (EA) inodes while holding a buffer lock on the external xattr block. This nested locking of buffer locks with allocation locks creates potential for deadlocks. Specifically, the allocation locking could acquire locks on other buffers, leading to a deadlock if the filesystem is corrupted, such as when a quota file contains an xattr block as a data block.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Nested Locking:** The primary weakness is the nesting of allocation locking (which can acquire other buffer locks) under the existing buffer lock held by `ext4_xattr_set_entry()`.
- **Deadlock Potential:** This nested locking creates a deadlock scenario, particularly in cases of filesystem corruption where other crucial file blocks may be locked.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **System Hang/Denial of Service:** The primary impact is a potential system hang or denial-of-service condition due to the deadlock. The system would become unresponsive, requiring a reboot.
- **Data Corruption (Indirect):** While not directly stated, a deadlock during filesystem operations could potentially lead to data corruption or inconsistencies depending on the specific scenario and the state of the filesystem at the time of the deadlock.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Filesystem Operations:** The vulnerability is triggered during filesystem operations that involve setting extended attributes on ext4 filesystems.
- **Filesystem Corruption:** The likelihood of triggering the deadlock is higher in scenarios where the filesystem is corrupted, such as a quota file referencing an xattr block as a data block.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local Access/Privileges:** An attacker would require the ability to perform filesystem operations that trigger the extended attribute setting functions. This would likely involve local access and potentially some level of user privileges.
- **Filesystem Manipulation:** In some cases, the attacker would need the ability to manipulate the filesystem to introduce the corrupted conditions which increase the likelihood of deadlock.

**Fix:**

The fix involves moving the allocation of EA inodes out of `ext4_xattr_set_entry()` and into the callers (`ext4_xattr_block_set` and `ext4_xattr_ibody_set`). This ensures that the allocation locking doesn't occur while holding the buffer lock, thus removing the deadlock potential.

**Summary of Changes**

The core change across all the diffs is the same:
1.  The `new_ea_inode` variable is removed from `ext4_xattr_set_entry`
2.  The creation of the EA inode (using `ext4_xattr_inode_lookup_create`) is moved to the callers `ext4_xattr_block_set` and `ext4_xattr_ibody_set`.
3.  The newly created `ea_inode` is passed as a parameter to `ext4_xattr_set_entry`
4.  The `iput(new_ea_inode)` calls were changed to `iput(ea_inode)`
5.  The callers now handle error conditions related to creating ea_inodes.
6.  Refcounting for the ea_inode in error conditions is now handled in the callers as well
7.  The callers were modified to pass the ea_inode to the  `ext4_xattr_set_entry` function and handle the inode's lifecycle after the function returns
