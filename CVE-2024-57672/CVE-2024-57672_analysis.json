CWE-770 is a base-level CWE and is a child of CWE-400. While CWE-770 is more specific, the description mentions a denial of service, but doesn't explicitly mention resource allocation without limits or throttling. Therefore, CWE-400 is selected as the primary CWE because it better represents the overall impact of the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    \n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe400 primary\n    class cwe770 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **missing security measure for link state transitions**. A malicious host can then modify a packet and send it multiple times, which removes an external link, and ultimately causes a denial of service due to **uncontrolled resource consumption**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the impact of the vulnerability, which is a denial of service. This led to considering CWE-400 as the primary CWE. The analysis considered the retriever results and specifications for each candidate CWE, and determined that CWE-400 is the best fit. The vulnerability description mentions a denial of service, so the best fit is CWE-400 **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption**, as it is the most general description of the impact. While CWE-770 **Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling** is a child of CWE-400, there is no explicit evidence of resource allocation, making the primary CWE more appropriate.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-346: Origin Validation Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly verify that the source of data or communication is valid.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
