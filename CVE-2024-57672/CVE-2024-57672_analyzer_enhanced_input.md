### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **component:** Topology Manager module, Topologylnstance module, Routing module
- **product:** floodlight
- **impact:** denial of service
- **attacker:** local attacker
- **version:** v1.2

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Here's a breakdown of the information from the provided content:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
*   A malicious host connected to a legacy switch can remove an external link containing the legacy switch from the topology by modifying a packet and sending it multiple times.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Missing security measures for link state transitions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Host data streams passing through the external link may not be forwarded properly, i.e., the two sides of the external link cannot communicate with each other.

**Attack vectors:**
*   A malicious host connected to a legacy switch.
*   The attacker needs to modify a packet and send it repeatedly.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker must be connected to a legacy switch.
*   The attacker must be able to modify packets.

**Mitigation or fix:**
*   NOINFO
