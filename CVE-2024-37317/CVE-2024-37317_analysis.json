If an attacker managed to share a folder called `Notes/` with a newly created user before they logged in, the Notes app would use that folder store the personal notes. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Notes app is upgraded to 4.9.3.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-37317:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\nThe Nextcloud Notes app incorrectly handles the creation of the notes folder when a user has a pre-existing shared folder with the name \"Notes/\". Specifically, if an attacker shares a folder named `Notes/` with a newly created user before that user logs in for the first time, the Notes app will incorrectly use that pre-existing shared folder as the designated storage location for the user's personal notes.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Incorrect Folder Handling:** The core weakness lies in the Notes app not properly verifying or handling pre-existing shared folders with the same name as the default notes folder. It lacks proper checks to ensure it creates a new folder for notes rather than using a shared folder\n*   **Missing Access Control:** The application fails to enforce proper access controls and implicitly trusts a shared folder when it should create a new directory within the user's storage.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker who can create a shared folder before a new user logs in can potentially access the victim's notes as they are stored in a location controlled by the attacker.\n*   **Integrity Violation:** The attacker could also manipulate the victim's notes, as they would have write access to the shared folder.\n*   **Availability Impact:** The attacker may cause issues with the expected behavior of the notes application, depending on how they choose to exploit the access.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network by sharing the specifically named folder with a targeted newly created user.\n*   **Shared folder:** The attack vector involves exploiting the shared folder mechanism of nextcloud.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Nextcloud User:** The attacker needs to have a valid user account on the same Nextcloud instance.\n*   **Share Permissions:** The attacker must have the permission to share folders within the Nextcloud instance.\n*   **Timing:** The attacker needs to share the \"Notes/\" folder with the victim before the victim logs in for the first time and the Notes app attempts to create the folder, exploiting a race condition of sorts.\n*  **Low Privilege:** The attacker requires only low privileges to exploit this.\n\n**Additional Notes**\n*   The vulnerability is rated as moderate.\n*   The issue was fixed in version 4.9.3 of the Nextcloud Notes app.\n*   The provided github content references a pull request that was intended to fix issues related to folder creation, but didn't fully fix the issue related to pre-existing shared folders.",

While it might seem broad, it captures the essence of the vulnerability where the application **incorrectly** uses a pre-existing shared folder instead of creating a new one with appropriate permissions.\n\nCWE-639 is related to authorization bypass through user-controlled keys. This could be relevant as the attacker essentially controls the \"key\" (the folder name) that the application uses for storage.\n\nCWE-22 is related to path traversal. Although not a direct path traversal issue, the application's **incorrect** handling of the path to the notes folder could be seen as a related concern.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe732[\"CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\"]\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe732 primary\n    class cwe639,cwe22 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n1.  Attacker creates a shared folder named \"Notes/\".\n2.  The application **incorrectly** assigns permissions or **incorrectly** handles folder creation, leading to the use of the attacker-controlled folder for the user's notes.\n3.  User's notes are stored in a location accessible to the attacker (Confidentiality Breach).\n4.  Attacker may manipulate the notes (Integrity Violation).\n\nThe **root cause** is the **incorrect permission assignment** or folder handling by the application.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary issue is that the Nextcloud Notes application doesn't properly handle the scenario where a shared folder with the name \"Notes/\" already exists before a new user's first login. This leads to the application using the attacker-controlled shared folder to store the user's notes, which results in a confidentiality breach.\n\nThe most fitting CWE is CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource. This CWE addresses the scenario where a product specifies permissions for a security-critical resource in a way that allows that resource to be read or modified by unintended actors. In this case, the \"critical resource\" is the notes folder, and the \"unintended actor\" is the attacker who created the shared folder.\n\nThe vulnerability description states that \"If an attacker managed to share a folder called `Notes/` with a newly created user before they logged in, the Notes app would use that folder store the personal notes.\" This clearly demonstrates that the application is **incorrectly** assigning permissions or **incorrectly** handling folder creation and usage, leading to the attacker gaining unauthorized access to the user's notes.\n\nCWE-732 is a Class-level weakness, and while it might be more generic, it aligns well with the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **incorrect handling** of the resource permissions.\n\nCWE-639 and CWE-22 were considered because the attacker is essentially bypassing the intended authorization mechanism by exploiting the **incorrect** folder handling. However, CWE-732 captures the core issue of the application **incorrectly** managing resource permissions, making it the primary CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 1169.98\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product specifies permissions for a security-critical resource in a way that allows that resource to be read or modified by unintended actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: While the name itself indicates an assignment of permissions for resources, this is often misused for vulnerabilities in which \"permissions\" are not checked, which is an \"authorization\" weakness (CWE-285 or descendants) within CWE's model [REF-1287].\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 2.28\n**Source**: graph\n\n**Description**:\nCWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.",
