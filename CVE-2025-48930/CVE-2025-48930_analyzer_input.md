# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-48930

## Vulnerability Description
The TeleMessage service through 2025-05-05 stores certain cleartext information in memory, even though memory content may be accessible to an adversary through various avenues, as exploited in the wild in May 2025.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **product:** TeleMessage service
- **version:** through 2025-05-05

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Here's an analysis of the provided content:

The content discusses a security breach of the TeleMessage Signal clone application. The vulnerability allowed a hacker to access sensitive information.

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The archive server of TeleMessage was badly misconfigured.
    *   Weak password hashing: The admin panel used MD5 for hashing passwords.
    *   Exposed heapdump endpoint: The server exposed a Java heap dump via a URL ending in **/heapdump**. This endpoint was publicly accessible, allowing the hacker to download the server's memory snapshot.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   Use of MD5 for password hashing.
    *   Publicly accessible heap dump endpoint (Spring Boot Actuator misconfiguration).
    *   Unencrypted messages uploaded to the archive server.
*   **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   The hacker could obtain usernames and passwords.
    *   The hacker could read plaintext chat logs.
    *   The hacker was able to compromise a customer of US Customs and Border Protection.
*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   Exploiting the publicly accessible heap dump endpoint.
    *   Brute-forcing login credentials via leaked password hashes.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   Knowledge of web server vulnerabilities.
    *   Ability to use tools like feroxbuster to discover publicly available resources.
    *   Ability to analyze Java heap dumps.
*   **Mitigation or fix:**
    *   Properly configure the Spring Boot Actuator to restrict access to sensitive endpoints like the heap dump.
    *   Use stronger password hashing algorithms.

**More detail than official CVE description:** The content provides detailed information about the specific misconfiguration, the tools used to exploit it, and the impact. It goes beyond a generic description of the vulnerability to explain the exact steps taken by the attacker.
