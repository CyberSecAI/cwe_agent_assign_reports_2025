## Vulnerability Description
In barebox before 2025.01.0, ext4fs_read_symlink has an **integer overflow** for zalloc (adding one to an le32 variable) via a crafted ext4 filesystem with an inode size of 0xffffffff, resulting in a malloc of zero and resultant memory overwrite, a related issue to CVE-2024-57256.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **integer overflow**
- **impact:** malloc of zero and resultant memory overwrite
- **vector:** crafted ext4 filesystem with an inode size of 0xffffffff
- **product:** barebox
- **version:** before 2025.01.0
- **component:** ext4fs_read_symlink

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## CVE Analysis: CVE-2024-57262 (PLACEHOLDER)

The provided content **RELATES** to a vulnerability in Barebox, specifically within the ext4 filesystem implementation. It details a fix for an integer overflow in the `ext4fs_read_symlink()` function.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information extracted from the content:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

An integer overflow occurs when adding 1 to a `le32` variable representing the inode size. This overflow happens because `zalloc()` expects a `size_t` type, and the overflow results in a zero allocation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Integer Overflow: The core vulnerability is an integer overflow when calculating the allocation size for the symlink buffer.
*   Heap-based buffer overflow: Due to the zero allocation, subsequent code uses the incorrect (zero) size for copying data, leading to a potential memory overwrite.

**Impact of exploitation:**

An attacker can overwrite memory, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**

*   A carefully crafted ext4 filesystem with an inode size of 0xffffffff can trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to create or modify an ext4 filesystem that is then mounted by the system.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   The vulnerability is fixed by using the `__builtin_add_overflow()` helper function to safely add 1 to the inode size, preventing the integer overflow.

**Additional Details:**

The content provides more detail than a typical CVE description would, including the specific function affected (`ext4fs_read_symlink()`), the type of overflow, and the mitigation implemented. The diffstat shows a single file change in `fs/ext4/ext4_common.c`.
