# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-50264

## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved vsock/virtio **Initialization of the dangling pointer** occurring in vsk->trans During loopback communication, a dangling pointer can be created in vsk->trans, potentially leading to a Use-After-Free condition. This issue is resolved by initializing vsk->trans to NULL.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **Initialization of the dangling pointer**
- **impact:** Use-After-Free
- **product:** Linux kernel
- **component:** vsock/virtio

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability addressed by the commits:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a dangling pointer in the `vsk->trans` member of the `vsock_sock` structure within the Linux kernel's VSOCK (Virtual Socket) implementation, specifically in the virtio transport layer. This pointer is not initialized to NULL and can become a dangling pointer after the `virtio_vsock_sock` structure it points to is freed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use-After-Free (UAF):** The primary vulnerability is a use-after-free condition. After the `virtio_vsock_sock` structure is freed, `vsk->trans` is not set to NULL, leading to a potential use of a dangling pointer in subsequent operations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Kernel Crash/Denial of Service:** A UAF vulnerability in the kernel can lead to unpredictable behavior, including kernel crashes or denial of service. This is because accessing freed memory can corrupt data, lead to invalid memory accesses, and ultimately cause a system halt.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Loopback Communication:** The vulnerability specifically occurs during loopback communication scenarios within the VSOCK implementation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Trigger Loopback Communication:** An attacker needs the ability to initiate loopback communication via VSOCK to trigger the vulnerability. This implies the attacker needs to have a user/process able to use VSOCK and influence its usage for loopback communication.

**Technical Details and Descriptions:**
- The fix involves adding the line `vsk->trans = NULL;` in the `virtio_transport_destruct` function after freeing the `virtio_vsock_sock` structure. This ensures that the dangling pointer is cleared, preventing the use-after-free.
- The vulnerability is addressed in commit `6ca575374dd9a507cdd16dfa0e78c2e9e20bd05f` and backported to the stable kernel tree by the commits `b110196fec44fe966952004bd426967c2a8fd358`,  `2a6a4e69f255b7aed17f93995691ab4f0d3c2203`, `eb1bdcb7dfc30b24495ee4c5533af0ed135cb5f1`, `44d29897eafd0e1196453d3003a4d5e0b968eeab`, `fd8ae346692a56b4437d626c5460c7104980f389`, `5f970935d09934222fdef3d0e20c648ea7a963c1`, `5f092a4271f6dccf88fe0d132475a17b69ef71df`.
- The fix is targeted at the `net/vmw_vsock/virtio_transport_common.c` file.
