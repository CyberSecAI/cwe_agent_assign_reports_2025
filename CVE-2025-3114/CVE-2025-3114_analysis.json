CWE-664 is a base level CWE, while CWE-506 is a class level CWE. The vulnerability involves bypassing sandbox restrictions which can include many types of improper control during its lifetime.\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe664[\"CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime\"]\n    cwe506[\"CWE-506: Embedded Malicious Code\"]\n\n    cwe506 -->|RELATED| cwe664\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe664 primary\n    class cwe506 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **sandbox bypass**, leading to the potential execution of **embedded malicious code**, ultimately resulting in system compromise.\n  - Root Cause: **Sandbox Bypass** (CWE-664)\n  - Weakness: Execution of **Embedded Malicious Code** (CWE-506)\n  - Impact: System Compromise\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause and the immediate consequence of the vulnerability. The primary CWE, CWE-664, captures the **improper control of a resource (sandbox)**, while the secondary CWE, CWE-506, highlights the presence of **embedded malicious code**. This assessment is heavily based on the vulnerability description, specifically the phrases \"**Sandbox Bypass Vulnerability**\" and \"attackers can create specially crafted files with **embedded code**\". The graph relationships helped in understanding how these two CWEs are related. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity as they accurately represent the weakness and its immediate consequence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-183: Permissive List of Allowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are explicitly allowed by policy because the inputs are assumed to be safe, but the list is too permissive - that is, it allows an input that is unsafe, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
