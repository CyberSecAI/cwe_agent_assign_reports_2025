  "query": "A vulnerability classified as critical was found in libzvbi up to 0.2.43. This vulnerability affects the function vbi_search_new of the file src/search.c. The manipulation of the argument pat_len leads to integer overflow. The attack can be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. Upgrading to version 0.2.44 is able to address this issue. The patch is identified as ca1672134b3e2962cd392212c73f44f8f4cb489f. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component. The code maintainer was informed beforehand about the issues. She reacted very fast and highly professional.",
