The change however left the existing pci_dev_put() untouched resulting in a doubple put. This can subsequently cause a use after free if the struct pci_dev is released in an unexpected state. Fix this by removing the extra pci_dev_put(). Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-415 CWE-1285 CWE-362 CWE-909 CWE-1256 CWE-667 CWE-252",
