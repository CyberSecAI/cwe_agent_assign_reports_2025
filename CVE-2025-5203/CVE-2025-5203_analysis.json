  "description": "A vulnerability was found in Open Asset Import Library Assimp 5.4.3. It has been rated as problematic. Affected by this issue is the function SkipSpaces in the library assimp/include/assimp/ParsingUtils.h. The manipulation leads to **out-of-bounds read**. Local access is required to approach this attack. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The project decided to collect all Fuzzer bugs in a main-issue to address them in the future.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2025-5203 (assuming a placeholder description exists):\n\n**CVE ID:** CVE-2025-5203\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe content relates to vulnerabilities found in the assimp library, specifically through fuzzing and sanitizers (like ASAN).  The issues are tracked under epic #6128 and include a specific bug report (#6175) detailing a heap out-of-bounds read.\n\n**Relevant Information (from issue #6175):**\n\n*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `while` loop condition in `SkipSpaces<char>` dereferences a pointer *before* checking if it's valid, leading to a potential read outside the allocated memory.\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Heap out-of-bounds read.\n*   **Impact of exploitation:**  The ASAN output indicates a heap-buffer-overflow, which could lead to crashes or potentially arbitrary code execution.\n*   **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability was discovered through fuzzing, suggesting that specially crafted input files could trigger the issue.\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious file that assimp attempts to parse.\n*   **Mitigation or fix:** The issue report doesn't provide a fix, but suggests the loop condition needs to be reordered to check the pointer before dereferencing it.\n*   **Affected code locations:**\n    *   `assimp/include/assimp/ParsingUtils.h` (lines 106, 122, 127, 143)\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n*   The content provides more detail than a typical CVE description would, including the specific code location and ASAN output.\n*   The epic #6128 tracks multiple fuzzing/sanitizer-discovered bugs, so this is likely not the only vulnerability in assimp.\n*   The issue is labeled as a \"Bug\", \"Fuzzer\", and \"Sanitizer\", indicating its origin and nature.\n*   The reproducer.zip file is available for testing.",

The CVE Reference Links Content Summary further supports this, detailing how the `while` loop condition in `SkipSpaces` dereferences a pointer before validating its validity, leading to the out-of-bounds read.
