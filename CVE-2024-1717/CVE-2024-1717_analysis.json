While it's a Class, no more specific Base-level CWEs directly fit the description. CWE-862 is related to other authorization CWEs like CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) and CWE-425 (Direct Request), but the vulnerability description focuses on the absence of a check, making CWE-862 the most appropriate. CWE-201 is a secondary issue that can result from the missing authorization.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe425[\"CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe425 -->|CHILDOF| cwe862\n    cwe863 -->|PEEROF| cwe862\n    cwe862 -->|CANLEADTO| cwe201\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe201 secondary\n    class cwe425,cwe863 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing capability check** (CWE-862) on the `handle_ajax_call()` function. Because of this **missing authorization**, authenticated attackers with subscriber-level access can retrieve a list of registered user emails which represents the **insertion of sensitive information into sent data** (CWE-201).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is a **missing capability check** on the `handle_ajax_call()` function (CWE-862). The vulnerability description clearly states this **missing check**, and the CVE reference links content summary confirms this root cause. The impact is unauthorized access to user emails (CWE-201). While CWE-862 is a Class, the evidence supports this as the most accurate representation of the **missing authorization**. The retriever results also support CWE-862 as the top candidate. The selection of CWE-862 is further justified by its Allowed-with-Review usage designation, acknowledging that more specific Base-level children might exist but are not applicable in this case.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery
