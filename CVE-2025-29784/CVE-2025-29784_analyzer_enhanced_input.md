## Vulnerability Description
NamelessMC is a free, easy to use & powerful website software for Minecraft servers. In version 2.1.4 and prior, the s parameter in GET requests for forum search functionality **lacks length validation**, allowing attackers to submit excessively long search queries. This oversight can lead to performance degradation and potential denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. This issue has been patched in version 2.2.0.

**CVE Description:** PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval (as per instructions)

**Vulnerability Details (extracted from github.com_db34e9e8_20250624_140808.html):**

*   **Root cause:** The `s` parameter in GET requests for forum search functionality lacks length validation.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of input validation, specifically length restriction on user-supplied input.
*   **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   Inefficient database queries (high CPU and memory usage).
    *   Cache inefficiency (memory bloat).
    *   Denial-of-Service (DoS) risk (server overwhelm).
*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   Crafted URL with an excessively long search query string (e.g., `https://target.com/forum/search/?s=aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...`).
    *   Sending a GET request with a very long `s` parameter.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  Network access to the vulnerable application. No authentication required.
*   **Mitigation or fix:** The vulnerability was patched in version 2.2.0 by adding length validation to the `s` parameter when handling GET requests, mirroring the validation already present for POST requests.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerable code is located in `modules/Forum/pages/forum/search.php`.
*   The release notes (github.com_f5b7a472_20250624_140807.html) confirm that version 2.2.0 addresses this issue.
*   CVSS score: 7.5 (High)
