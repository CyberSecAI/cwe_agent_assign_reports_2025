  "description": "NamelessMC is a free, easy to use & powerful website software for Minecraft servers. In version 2.1.4 and prior, the s parameter in GET requests for forum search functionality **lacks length validation**, allowing attackers to submit excessively long search queries. This oversight can lead to performance degradation and potential denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. This issue has been patched in version 2.2.0.",

No authentication required.\n*   **Mitigation or fix:** The vulnerability was patched in version 2.2.0 by adding length validation to the `s` parameter when handling GET requests, mirroring the validation already present for POST requests.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n*   The vulnerable code is located in `modules/Forum/pages/forum/search.php`.\n*   The release notes (github.com_f5b7a472_20250624_140807.html) confirm that version 2.2.0 addresses this issue.\n*   CVSS score: 7.5 (High)\n\nThe provided content offers significantly more detail than a typical CVE description, including code snippets, a proof-of-concept (PoC) script, and a detailed explanation of the impact.",

CWE-1284 can precede CWE-789 (Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value).

This leads to attackers submitting excessively long search queries, which can cause performance degradation and potentially lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack (CWE-400).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe analysis indicates that the primary weakness is the **lack of length validation** for the `s` parameter in GET requests (CWE-1284). The evidence supports this classification as the vulnerability description explicitly mentions this **lack of validation** as the root cause. The impact of this weakness is performance degradation and potential denial-of-service (DoS), which aligns with CWE-400.\n\nThe selection of CWE-1284 is based on the following evidence:\n\n*   \"**lacks length validation**\" - directly points to a validation issue related to quantity (length).\n\nCWE-400 is considered a secondary weakness as it represents the potential impact of the primary weakness (CWE-1284), but is a more general case, and not necessarily guaranteed.\n\nThe retriever results also support CWE-1284 as the top match.\n\nCWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) was considered but not selected as the primary CWE because CWE-1284 provides a more specific description of the vulnerability. The mapping guidance for CWE-20 discourages its use when lower-level CWEs are available.\nCWE-789 (Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value) was considered but not selected because the description doesn't specifically state it's a memory allocation issue, but it is a possibility.\nCWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) was considered but not selected because the description doesn't specifically state it's a resource allocation issue without limits, but it is a possibility.\nCWE-1333 (Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity) was considered but not selected because it is not clear if the search functionality uses regular expressions or not.\nCWE-90 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an LDAP Query ('LDAP Injection')) was considered but not selected because there is no evidence that LDAP queries are used by the application.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-1284 being a Base level CWE that accurately represents the root cause of the vulnerability.",
