- **product:** FreeFloat FTP Server
- **version:** 1
- **component:** MGET Command Handler

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-5112 Content

Based on the provided content, this relates to a **buffer overflow vulnerability in Freefloat FTP Server 1.0**, triggered by the `MGET` command.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the handling of the `MGET` command. The server does not properly validate the size of the input provided with the `MGET` command, allowing an attacker to send a payload larger than the allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** The core vulnerability is a buffer overflow.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The server fails to validate the size of the input received via the `MGET` command.

**Impact of exploitation:**

Successful exploitation allows the attacker to overwrite the execution flow of the program, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution. The exploit author demonstrates achieving shell access.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Remote:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely via the FTP protocol.
*   **MGET Command:** The attack is triggered by sending a specially crafted payload via the `MGET` command.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the target FTP server.
*   **FTP Client:** The attacker needs an FTP client to send the malicious `MGET` command.
*   **Payload Crafting:** The attacker needs to craft a payload that exploits the buffer overflow, including calculating the correct offset, EIP overwrite value, and shellcode.

**Mitigation or fix:**

The content does not provide information about a specific fix. However, mitigation would involve:

*   **Input Validation:** Implement robust input validation to ensure the size of the data received with the `MGET` command does not exceed the buffer's capacity.
*   **Buffer Overflow Protection:** Employ buffer overflow protection mechanisms (e.g., stack canaries, Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), Data Execution Prevention (DEP)).

**Additional Details (More detail than official CVE description):**

*   **Specific Version:** The exploit was tested on Freefloat FTP Server 1.0.
*   **Offset:** The offset to overwrite the EIP is 246 bytes.
*   **EIP Overwrite:** The EIP is overwritten with `0x7C86467B` (JMP ESP).
*   **Bad Characters:** The exploit avoids using `\x00`, `\x0a`, and `\x0d` characters.
*   **Shellcode:** The exploit includes shellcode to establish a reverse TCP connection to `192.168.232.129` on port `4444`.
*   **Exploit Script:** The content provides a Perl script to automate the exploitation process.
*   **Tested Environment:** Windows XP SP3 English.
