# Analysis Report for CVE-2025-31124

# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2025-31124

## Description

Zitadel is open-source identity infrastructure software. ZITADEL administrators can enable a setting called Ignoring unknown usernames which helps mitigate attacks that try to guess/enumerate usernames. If enabled, ZITADEL will show the password prompt even if the user doesnt exist and report Username or Password invalid. While the setting was correctly respected during the login flow, the users username was normalized leading to a disclosure of the users existence. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.71.6, 2.70.8, 2.69.9, 2.68.9, 2.67.13, 2.66.16, 2.65.7, 2.64.6, and 2.63.9.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Weakness:** username normalization
- **Impact:** disclosure of users existence
- **Product:** Zitadel
- **Component:** login flow

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-203 | Observable Discrepancy | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE. The product behaves differently based on valid/invalid usernames, exposing security-relevant information. |
| CWE-204 | Observable Response Discrepancy | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The response differs based on whether the username exists, revealing internal state. |
| CWE-1390 | Weak Authentication | 0.5 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Authentication mechanism is indirectly weakened by allowing user enumeration. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-203 (Observable Discrepancy), which is a parent of CWE-204 (Observable Response Discrepancy). CWE-203 captures the general issue of the system behaving differently based on valid/invalid usernames. CWE-204 is a more specific case where the difference is in the response. CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication) is a higher-level class that is indirectly related. The choice of CWE-203 as primary is based on its ability to capture the root cause, while CWE-204 is a more specific manifestation of this cause.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **username normalization** (the **weakness**) which leads to an **observable discrepancy** (CWE-203). The observable discrepancy allows for **user enumeration**, which is the impact.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis focuses on the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **username normalization** during the login flow. This leads to an observable discrepancy where the system behaves differently based on whether a username exists. The evidence for this is clear in the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which states that "The root cause is the removal of username normalization during the login flow, which allowed an attacker to determine if a username exists within the system."

CWE-203 (Observable Discrepancy) is the most appropriate primary CWE because it captures the general issue of the system behaving differently, exposing security-relevant information. CWE-204 (Observable Response Discrepancy) is a more specific manifestation of this issue, where the response differs based on username validity. CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication) is considered but is a higher-level class that is indirectly related, as the user enumeration weakens the authentication mechanism.

The selection of CWE-203 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it captures the root cause of the vulnerability without being overly specific to the response mechanism.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-204: Observable Response Discrepancy
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product provides different responses to incoming requests in a way that reveals internal state information to an unauthorized actor outside of the intended control sphere.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
