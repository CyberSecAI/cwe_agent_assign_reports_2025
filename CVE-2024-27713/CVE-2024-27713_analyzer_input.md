# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-27713

## Vulnerability Description
An issue in Eskooly Free Online School management Software v.3.0 and before allows a remote attacker to escalate privileges via the HTTP Response Header Settings component.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** escalate privileges
- **attacker:** remote attacker
- **product:** Eskooly Free Online School management Software
- **version:** v.3.0 and before
- **component:** HTTP Response Header Settings component

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The Eskooly web application does not implement or incorrectly implements protection mechanisms, specifically security headers and cookie protections, which are essential for defense against attacks.
*   Flaws in the sign-up process allow manipulation of account settings during registration.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Missing Security Headers:** The application is missing several critical security headers, including:
    *   `X-Frame-Options`
    *   `X-Content-Type-Options`
    *   `Strict-Transport-Security` (HSTS)
    *   Permissions-Policy
    *   Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy
*   **No Cookie Protection:** Lack of protection mechanisms for cookies.
*   **Account Manipulation:** Vulnerabilities in the sign-up process allow attackers to manipulate account settings during registration

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Clickjacking:** Due to the missing `X-Frame-Options` header, attackers can trick users into performing unintended actions by embedding the website in a malicious frame.
*  **MIME Sniffing Attacks:** Absence of `X-Content-Type-Options` allows attackers to potentially execute code by exploiting browser's MIME type sniffing, leading to XSS or other code execution vulnerabilities.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** Without `Strict-Transport-Security` (HSTS), communications between the user and the website are vulnerable to interception and manipulation, compromising confidentiality and integrity.
*   **Unauthorized Privilege Escalation:** Attackers can register accounts with higher privileges than intended by manipulating settings during the signup process.
*  **Data Theft**: The absence of  Permissions-Policy and Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy opens up additional avenues for unauthorized access and data theft

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** Attackers can intercept network traffic if HSTS is not implemented.
*   **Browser-Based:** Clickjacking and MIME sniffing attacks can be executed through web browsers.
*   **Sign-up process:** Attackers can manipulate the account settings during registration to gain unauthorized privileges
**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker can be either on the same network or external.
*   The attacker needs to have the ability to interact with the web application through the user’s browser or via the network to intercept requests.
* The attacker needs to have an understanding of the registration process to exploit the privilege escalation vulnerability.

**Additional Notes**

The provided content offers more detailed information compared to a standard CVE description, especially in elaborating the impacts of missing security headers and providing context to account manipulation.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* 🔍 *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* 🔍 *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion – CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### 🔸 CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ✅ *“A user created with the ‘guest’ role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ✅ *“The backup service runs as root but only needs read access.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ⚠️ This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### 🔸 CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ✅ *“User can access another user’s invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.”*

## Mapping Examples – Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *“User can escalate privileges to admin.”*
> ❌ Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged – only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ✅ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**

| “Escalate to root/admin”                    | Privilege escalation impact           | Not CWE-269! Use root cause (e.g., 266, 250) |
| “Assigned wrong role/group”                 | Misassigned privilege                 | CWE-266                                      |
| “Runs as root” or “Should not run as admin” | Over-privileged execution             | CWE-250                                      |
| “Unauthorized read/write to file”           | Permission control issue              | CWE-285                                      |
| “Can access resource without correct role”  | Incorrect or missing permission check | CWE-285, 862, 863                            |

## Good Mapping Examples – Privileges & Permissions

* ✅ **CWE-266**: *“When a new user registers, the system assigns them admin role due to a missing role validation.”*
* ✅ **CWE-250**: *“Installer runs with system-level privileges but doesn't require them to install files in the user directory.”*
* ✅ **CWE-284**: *“Inconsistent access rules between UI and backend for sensitive endpoints.”*
* ✅ **CWE-285**: *“Authorization logic fails to restrict access to finance reports based on department.”*
