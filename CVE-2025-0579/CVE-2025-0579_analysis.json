  "description": "A vulnerability was found in Shiprocket Module 3/4 on OpenCart. It has been declared as critical. Affected by this vulnerability is an unknown functionality of the file /index.php?route=extension/shiprocket/module/restapi of the component REST API Module. The manipulation of the argument x-username leads to **sql injection**. The attack can be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",

Either the value is cast to a numeric format, or the database driver's escape method is used.\n*   **More detail than official CVE description**: Yes, the content provides specific details about vulnerable versions, attack vectors, and mitigation strategies. It also includes steps to reproduce the vulnerability with example payloads. It details the affected versions of the module, specific HTTP headers and GET parameters that are vulnerable. It also details the exploitation using the sqlmap tool\n```",

The vulnerability description and CVE Reference Links Content Summary both explicitly mention SQL Injection as the root cause. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship considered was the parent-child relationship within the CWE hierarchy. While CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')) is a parent of CWE-89, the specific nature of the vulnerability being an SQL Injection makes CWE-89 the more appropriate and specific choice. Other relationships like CanPrecede or CanFollow weren't relevant in this case as we're focusing on the root cause. The abstraction level was a key factor, with the preference for the Base level CWE-89 over the Class level CWE-74.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    \n    cwe89 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe89 primary\n    class cwe74 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain consists of a single point:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Improper sanitization** of user-supplied input leading to CWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')).\n\nThere are no further links in the chain presented by the current vulnerability description. The SQL Injection is the root cause and also the point of impact.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly pointed towards CWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')), and the retriever results confirmed this with a high score. The evidence from both the vulnerability description (**sql injection**) and CVE Reference Links Content Summary (**SQL Injection (SQLi)**) supports this. The graph relationships highlight the hierarchy, and the mapping guidance confirms that using the Base level CWE-89 is appropriate. The decision is based on direct evidence and supported by the tools and guidance provided. The selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because the description specifically mentions the vulnerability is an SQL Injection.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.
