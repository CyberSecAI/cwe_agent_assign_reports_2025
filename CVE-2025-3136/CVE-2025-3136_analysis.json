The vulnerability results in **memory corruption** due to manipulation of `torch.cuda.memory.caching_allocator_delete`. |\n| CWE-119 | Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer | 0.5 | Class | Allowed | Secondary CWE. CWE-787 is a child of CWE-119. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship influencing the decision is the parent-child relationship between CWE-787 and CWE-119. CWE-787 is a more specific case of CWE-119, so it is the preferred mapping. There are no chain relationships apparent from the provided information.

The Retriever Results also lists CWE-787 as the top combined result with a score of 1.0.
