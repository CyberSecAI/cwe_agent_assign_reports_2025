  "description": "A vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, has been found in 1902756969 reggie 1.0. Affected by this issue is some unknown functionality of the file /user/sendMsg of the component Phone Number Validation Handler. The manipulation of the argument code leads to information disclosure. The attack may be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, this relates to **CVE-2025-0403** as it details a vulnerability in the \"reggie\" application. Here's a breakdown of the information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe verification code sent to the user's phone number is not properly processed and is included in the response data.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Insecure handling of verification codes.\n*   Exposure of sensitive information (verification code) in the API response.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nAn attacker can obtain the verification code and bypass authentication, allowing them to log in as any user.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   An attacker intercepts the API response when requesting a verification code.\n*   The attacker then uses the intercepted verification code to log in.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   Ability to intercept network traffic or access the API response.\n*   No authentication required to trigger the vulnerability.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\nThe content does not specify a fix, but it implies that the application needs to be modified to prevent the verification code from being included in the API response. Secure handling of verification codes is required.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n*   The vulnerability is reproducible when the Redis service is enabled locally.\n*   The Redis service IP address can be modified in `src/main/resources/application.yml`.\n*   The HTTP POST request to `/user/sendMsg` shows the vulnerable interaction.\n*   The issue was reported on January 2, 2025.\n\nThe content provides more detail than a typical CVE description, including the specific API endpoint and request/response details.",

While other CWEs were considered based on the retriever results, none provided a more accurate or specific classification for the **root cause** of the vulnerability, which is the exposure of sensitive information in error messages.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe209[\"CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    \n    class cwe209 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper handling of the verification code**, leading to its inclusion in the API response, which then results in **information disclosure**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE, CWE-209, was selected because it directly addresses the core issue of the vulnerability: the generation of an error message containing sensitive information. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" explicitly states \"Exposure of sensitive information (verification code) in the API response.\" This aligns perfectly with the description of CWE-209. The retriever results also included other CWEs, but they were either too generic (e.g., CWE-755) or focused on different aspects of the vulnerability (e.g., input validation).
