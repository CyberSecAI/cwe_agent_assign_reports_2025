This vulnerability has to do with the account recovery system where there does not appear to be a check to make sure the user has been sent the recovery email and entered the correct code. If the attacker knew the email of the target, they could supply the email and immediately prompt the server to update the password without ever needing the code. This issue has been patched in version 1.7.3. Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-489 CWE-288 CWE-1390 CWE-640 CWE-302 CWE-603 CWE-256 CWE-305 CWE-306 CWE-304",
