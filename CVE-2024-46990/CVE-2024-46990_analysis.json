  "description": "Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. When relying on blocking access to localhost using the default `0.0.0.0` filter a user may bypass this block by using other registered loopback devices (like `127.0.0.2` - `127.127.127.127`). This issue has been addressed in release versions 10.13.3 and 11.1.0. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may block this bypass by manually adding the `127.0.0.0/8` CIDR range which will block access to any `127.X.X.X` ip instead of just `127.0.0.1`.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-46990:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability stems from an insufficient IP address filtering mechanism in the `is-denied-ip.ts` file. The default blocklist only included `0.0.0.0`, which is not sufficient to block all loopback addresses. It fails to consider other loopback addresses within the `127.0.0.0/8` CIDR range (e.g. `127.0.0.2` - `127.255.255.254`), allowing a bypass of the intended loopback access restriction.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Inadequate Input Validation:** The IP address filter only checked for an exact match against `0.0.0.0` instead of validating against the entire loopback range.\n- **SSRF bypass:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass intended restrictions of localhost access, potentially leading to Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **SSRF:** An attacker could potentially craft requests targeting internal services accessible on loopback addresses. This could expose internal services and potentially lead to further attacks.\n- **Confidentiality:** While the direct impact on data confidentiality is rated as \"low\", the vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access to internal services, which could expose sensitive data.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network, meaning the attacker can be remote.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Low privileges:** The attacker requires low privileges within the system to exploit this vulnerability.\n- **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable application.\n- **No user interaction:** No user interaction is needed to trigger the vulnerability\n\n**Additional details:**\n- The vulnerability is fixed in versions `10.13.3` and `11.1.0`.\n- A workaround was suggested to manually block the `127.0.0.0/8` CIDR range.\n- The vulnerability was reported by user `r3dpower`.\n- The CVSS score is 5.0, with a base metric string of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N.",

While CWE-923 (Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints) is a related Class-level CWE, CWE-941 is more specific in describing the **incorrect specification of the destination** within the communication channel.

However, the core issue is the **incorrect specification of the destination** IP address in the communication channel, making CWE-941 the most accurate primary CWE. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms this, stating that the \"vulnerability stems from an insufficient IP address filtering mechanism\" and the \"IP address filter only checked for an exact match against 0.0.0.0 instead of validating against the entire loopback range.\" This aligns perfectly with the description of CWE-941. The potential for SSRF (CWE-918) and authentication bypass (CWE-306) are secondary impacts of this **incorrect specification**.\n\nThe graph relationships and retriever results were helpful in considering alternative CWEs, but the detailed analysis of the vulnerability description and the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" provided strong evidence for selecting CWE-941 as the primary CWE.
