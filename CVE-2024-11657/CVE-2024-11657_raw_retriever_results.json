Affected is an unknown function of the file /admin/network/diag_nslookup. The manipulation of the argument diag_nslookup leads to command injection. It is possible to launch the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",
