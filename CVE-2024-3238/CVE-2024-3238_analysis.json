  "description": "The WordPress Menu Plugin - Superfly Responsive Menu plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 5.0.29. This is due to **missing or incorrect nonce validation** on the ajax_handle_delete_icons() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary files via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. Please not the CSRF was patched in 5.0.28, however, adequate **directory traversal** protection wasnt introduced until 5.0.30.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n- Missing or incorrect nonce validation in the `ajax_handle_delete_icons()` function within the Superfly Responsive Menu WordPress plugin. This allows Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.\n- Insufficient directory traversal protection was present until version 5.0.30\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper nonce validation, which makes it possible for attackers to forge requests.\n- **Arbitrary File Deletion:** Due to the missing validation, attackers can potentially delete arbitrary files on the server.\n- **Directory Traversal:** Insufficient checks allow directory traversal attacks when deleting files until version 5.0.30\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **File Deletion:** Attackers can delete arbitrary files on the server, potentially causing data loss or disrupting website functionality.\n- **Website Compromise:**  In combination with other vulnerabilities, it could contribute to a more complete website compromise.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **CSRF:** The attacker must trick a logged-in administrator into performing an action, such as clicking on a malicious link, which triggers the forged request.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Unauthenticated Attacker:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated on the target website.\n- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to use social engineering techniques to trick an administrator into clicking a malicious link or performing an action that triggers the forged request.\n- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to make a request to the target server.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The vulnerability was present in all versions up to and including 5.0.29.\n- Version 5.0.30 addresses the directory traversal protection vulnerability\n- The CSRF vulnerability was patched in version 5.0.28, but directory traversal protection was not implemented until 5.0.30\n\nThe provided information from Wordfence is a more detailed description than the placeholder CVE description.",

Evidence for this includes the vulnerability description key phrases and the CVE reference links summary that highlights \"Missing or incorrect nonce validation...allows Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.\" Additionally, CWE-22 [Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')] was identified as a secondary vulnerability because of the **directory traversal** issue when deleting files.

The core issue is the **missing or incorrect nonce validation**, which aligns more directly with CWE-352 [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)].\n\nCWE-425 [Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')] was considered but not selected. The primary issue is not the lack of authorization checks, but rather the **missing or incorrect nonce validation**, which allows an attacker to bypass the existing authorization mechanism using CSRF.\n\nCWE-434 [Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type] was considered but not selected. The vulnerability does not involve uploading files.\n\nCWE-471 [Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID)] was considered but not selected, as there is no modification of data assumed to be immutable.",
