CWE-89 is a Base level CWE and directly addresses the root cause of **improper neutralization** leading to SQL Injection. The retriever results strongly suggested CWE-89 as the top candidate.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    \n    class cwe89 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**, which leads to **time-based SQL Injection**, and finally results in the ability to **extract sensitive information from the database**.
