# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-20526

## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability in the SSH server of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition for the SSH server of an affected device. This vulnerability is due to a **logic error** when an SSH session is established. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted SSH messages to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust available SSH resources on the affected device so that new SSH connections to the device are denied, resulting in a DoS condition. Existing SSH connections to the device would continue to function normally. The device must be rebooted manually to recover. However, user traffic would not be impacted and could be managed using a remote application such as Cisco Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM).

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **logic error**
- **impact:** denial of service (DoS)
- **vector:** crafted SSH messages
- **attacker:** unauthenticated remote attacker
- **product:** Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software
- **component:** SSH server

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A logic error occurs when an SSH session is established on Cisco ASA Software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the SSH server implementation of Cisco ASA software when handling crafted SSH messages. Specifically, it's a resource exhaustion issue due to the logic flaw.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition on the SSH server. This prevents new SSH connections to the device, though existing connections remain functional. The device requires a manual reboot to recover the SSH service. User traffic isn't impacted, and remote management using applications such as Cisco ASDM remains possible.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited remotely by sending specially crafted SSH messages to the affected device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the SSH port on a vulnerable Cisco ASA device. No authentication is required.
