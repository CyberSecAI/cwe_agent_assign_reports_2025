# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-29315

## Vulnerability Description
An issue in the Shiro-based RBAC (Role-based Access Control) mechanism of OpenDaylight Service Function Chaining (SFC) Subproject SFC Sodium-SR4 and below allows attackers to execute privileged operations via a crafted request.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** execute privileged operations
- **vector:** crafted request
- **attacker:** attackers
- **product:** OpenDaylight Service Function Chaining
- **version:** SFC Sodium-SR4 and below
- **component:** Shiro-based RBAC

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
CVE-2025-29315 is related to the content. Here's the extracted information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The mismatch between Shiro’s static RBAC and the dynamic nature of SFC resources. Specifically, coarse-grained URL-to-role mapping and a lack of context-aware authorization checks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Coarse-grained URL-to-role mapping in Shiro configuration.
*   Lack of context-aware authorization checks (resource ownership, session state).
*   Use of wildcard URL patterns (e.g., `/**`) expanding the attack surface.
*   Static RBAC model.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Privilege escalation: Low-privileged users can execute administrative actions.
*   Data breach: Access to sensitive data within the SFC.
*   Service interruption: Modification or deletion of critical SFC components.

**Attack vectors:**
*   Crafting malicious HTTP requests (e.g., DELETE requests) to tamper with SFC configurations.
*   Exploiting broadly permitted paths for roles to execute unintended operations.
*   Exploiting lack of tenant-ID validation to access resources of other tenants.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   Low-privileged user account (e.g., role USER).
*   Ability to send HTTP requests to the OpenDaylight controller.
*   Knowledge of the SFC resource paths and Shiro configuration.

**Mitigation or fix:**
The blog post does not explicitly state a fix, but implies the need for a more context-sensitive and fine-grained RBAC model that validates resource ownership and dynamic context.

**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**
The blog post provides detailed steps to reproduce the vulnerability, including commands to check user accounts and roles, and examples of HTTP requests. It also highlights the specific OpenDaylight version (sodium-sr4) and OS (Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS) used for testing. The post also details the roles and permissions of different users within the system.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control

**Authentication**:
Determines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.

* Example phrases: "user must log in", "lack of login check", "bypasses login"
* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.

  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* – used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).

**Authorization**:
Determines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do. It decides access *after* identity is verified.

* Example phrases: "unauthorized access", "regular user can access admin panel", "role checks are missing"
* CWE relevance: use CWEs like 862, 863, 285 for authorization errors:

  * **CWE-862**: *Missing Authorization* – the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all.
  * **CWE-863**: *Incorrect Authorization* – the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).
  * **CWE-285**: *Improper Authorization* – general category for any flawed authorization logic or design.

**Access Control**:
A broader term that includes both authentication and authorization. Governs how resources are protected and who can access them under what conditions.

* CWE relevance:

  * **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* – top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear.
  * This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.

## Mapping Discussion – Common Misclassification Patterns

### 1. **CWE-306 vs CWE-862**:

* **306** is about lack of **authentication** (e.g., *no login required at all*).
* **862** is about lack of **authorization** *after* authentication (e.g., *admin check missing*).
* ✅ Example CWE-306: *“An unauthenticated attacker can invoke the password reset API.”*
* ✅ Example CWE-862: *“An authenticated user without admin privileges can delete any user account.”*

### 2. **CWE-285 vs CWE-284**:

* **285** is specific to authorization flaws – it's a better choice than 284 **if** the issue involves *improper or missing role checks*.
* **284** should be reserved for general access control issues when it’s unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.

---

## Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification

**Phrase like "unauthorized access" is not enough.**

* If you **cannot determine whether identity was checked**, assume it’s **authorization** and consider 862 or 863.
* If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** → CWE-306.
* If the **access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced**, but it's not due to missing checks, consider **CWE-284**.

---

## Good Mapping Examples

* ✅ **CWE-306**: “The endpoint `/admin/deleteUser` does not require any authentication.”
* ✅ **CWE-862**: “Any logged-in user can change any other user's email without being an admin.”
* ✅ **CWE-863**: “An admin check exists but incorrectly grants access to non-admin users.”
* ✅ **CWE-285**: “Application uses a static role check that fails when roles change dynamically.”
* ✅ **CWE-284**: “Inconsistent enforcement of access rules across services with unclear policy source.”
