CWE-863 is a Class-level CWE, and there might be more specific Base-level children that are applicable but not evident from the provided information. CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) is considered as a secondary candidate, especially if the **incorrect access control** stems from missing authentication checks in the first place. If authentication is missing, then there will be no role based access control.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n\n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe306 secondary\n    class cwe287,cwe285,cwe284 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain begins with **incorrect access control**, leading to the ability for unauthorized attackers to obtain Administrator account access.\n\n*   **Root Cause:** **Incorrect Access Control** (CWE-863 or CWE-306).\n*   **Impact:** Obtain Administrator account access.\n\nIf authentication is missing (CWE-306), then that would be the root cause. If authentication is present, but not properly implemented, then CWE-863 would be the root cause.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe primary assessment is based on the provided vulnerability description which highlights \"**Incorrect access control**\" as the root cause. The \"**impact**\" is the ability to \"obtain Administrator account access.\"\n\nThe selection of CWE-863 is influenced by the guidance provided, which recommends considering CWEs like 862, 863, or 285 for authorization errors when an authenticated actor is able to perform unauthorized actions. Since the description explicitly states \"**incorrect access control**,\" it implies that some form of access control is in place, but it is not functioning correctly. This leans towards an authorization issue rather than a complete lack of authentication.\n\nCWE-306 is a possibility and is included as a secondary candidate, especially if the \"**Incorrect access control**\" is actually due to **missing authentication**.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity based on the available evidence.

CWE-863 is a Class-level CWE, and there might be more specific Base-level children that are applicable but not evident from the provided information. CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) is considered as a secondary candidate, especially if the **incorrect access control** stems from missing authentication checks in the first place. If authentication is missing, then there will be no role based access control.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n\n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe306 secondary\n    class cwe287,cwe285,cwe284 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain begins with **incorrect access control**, leading to the ability for unauthorized attackers to obtain Administrator account access.\n\n*   **Root Cause:** **Incorrect Access Control** (CWE-863 or CWE-306).\n*   **Impact:** Obtain Administrator account access.\n\nIf authentication is missing (CWE-306), then that would be the root cause. If authentication is present, but not properly implemented, then CWE-863 would be the root cause.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe primary assessment is based on the provided vulnerability description which highlights \"**Incorrect access control**\" as the root cause. The \"**impact**\" is the ability to \"obtain Administrator account access.\"\n\nThe selection of CWE-863 is influenced by the guidance provided, which recommends considering CWEs like 862, 863, or 285 for authorization errors when an authenticated actor is able to perform unauthorized actions. Since the description explicitly states \"**incorrect access control**,\" it implies that some form of access control is in place, but it is not functioning correctly. This leans towards an authorization issue rather than a complete lack of authentication.\n\nCWE-306 is a possibility and is included as a secondary candidate, especially if the \"**Incorrect access control**\" is actually due to **missing authentication**.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity based on the available evidence. While there might be more specific variants of CWE-863, the provided information does not offer enough detail to pinpoint them accurately.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
