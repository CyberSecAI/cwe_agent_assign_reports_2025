CWE-98, a more specific form of file inclusion vulnerability in PHP, is considered a secondary CWE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe96[\"CWE-96: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Statically Saved Code ('Static Code Injection')\"]\n    cwe98[\"CWE-98: Improper Control of Filename for Include/Require Statement in PHP Program ('PHP Remote File Inclusion')\"]\n    cwe98 -->|RELATED| cwe96\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe96 primary\n    class cwe98 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper neutralization of directives** (CWE-96) leading to **PHP Local File Inclusion** (CWE-98). The **improper neutralization** allows an attacker to manipulate the filename used in an include/require statement, leading to the inclusion of unintended files.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE selected is CWE-96 because the vulnerability description highlights **improper neutralization of directives** as the root cause. The description explicitly mentions \"Static Code Injection,\" which aligns well with CWE-96. CWE-98 is included as a secondary CWE because the vulnerability specifically leads to \"PHP Local File Inclusion.\"\n\nThe retriever results also support the selection of CWE-96 and CWE-98. CWE-96 has a high similarity score. CWE-98 is the top combined result and is directly related to PHP file inclusion vulnerabilities.\n\nCWE-94 ('Code Injection') was considered, but it's too broad. The description focuses on **improper neutralization**, making CWE-96 a more accurate fit. CWE-22 ('Path Traversal') was also considered, but the vulnerability description emphasizes file inclusion rather than path traversal. CWE-79 ('Cross-site Scripting') is irrelevant because the vulnerability is not related to web page generation or script injection.\n\nThe final decision is based on the vulnerability description, which highlights the **improper neutralization** as the root cause and the resulting **PHP Local File Inclusion**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-96: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Statically Saved Code ('Static Code Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes code syntax before inserting the input into an executable resource, such as a library, configuration file, or template.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Explanation**: The vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"Static Code Injection,\" making CWE-96 a strong candidate.
