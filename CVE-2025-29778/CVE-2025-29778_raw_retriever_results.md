# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2025-29778
## Query
Kyverno is a policy engine designed for cloud native platform engineering teams. Prior to version 1.14.0-alpha.1, Kyverno ignores subjectRegExp and IssuerRegExp while verifying artifacts sign with keyless mode. It allows the attacker to deploy kubernetes resources with the artifacts that were signed by unexpected certificate. Deploying these unauthorized kubernetes resources can lead to full compromise of kubernetes cluster. Version 1.14.0-alpha.1 contains a patch for the issue.

## Keyphrases
- **weakness**: 'ignores subjectRegExp', 'IssuerRegExp while verifying artifacts sign with keyless mode'
