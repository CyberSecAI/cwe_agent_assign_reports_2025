# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-10111

## Vulnerability Description
The OAuth Single Sign On SSO (OAuth Client) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in all versions up to, and including, 6.26.3. This is due to **insufficient verification** on the user being returned by the social login token. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator, if they have access to the username and the user does not have an already-existing account for the service returning the token.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **insufficient verification**
- **impact:** authentication bypass and log in as any existing user
- **attacker:** unauthenticated attackers
- **product:** OAuth Single Sign On SSO (OAuth Client) plugin for WordPress
- **version:** all versions up to and including 6.26.3

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Here's the breakdown of the vulnerability information from the provided content:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-10111

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   Insufficient verification of the user data returned by the social login token.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   Improper Authentication: The plugin fails to properly validate the user information received after a social login, allowing an attacker to potentially bypass the authentication process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Authentication Bypass: An unauthenticated attacker can log in as any existing user on the WordPress site, including administrator accounts.
*   Full system compromise is possible given the ability to gain administrator access.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Social Login: The vulnerability is exploited through the social login feature of the plugin.
*   Username knowledge: Attackers must know a valid username on the target site.
*   Social Login account: The attacker must NOT have an existing linked social login account for the provider being used for the exploit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to interact with the login page of the target WordPress site.
*   The attacker must know the username of an existing user on the WordPress site.
*   The attacker must have an account with a social login provider supported by the plugin.
*   The target user MUST NOT have previously linked an account with the social login provider.

**Additional Details:**
*   **Affected Software:** WordPress plugin "OAuth Single Sign On – SSO (OAuth Client)"
*   **Affected Versions:** All versions up to and including 6.26.3
*   **Researcher:** Wesley (wcraft)
*   **CVSS Score:** 8.1 (High)
*   **Mitigation:** The content suggests that there is no known patch available, and recommends to review the vulnerability details and employ mitigations based on the organization’s risk tolerance, which may include uninstalling the plugin.
*   **Vulnerability Timeline**: Publicly Published on December 11, 2024, and Last Updated on December 12, 2024.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control

**Authentication**:
Determines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.

* Example phrases: "user must log in", "lack of login check", "bypasses login"
* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.

  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* – used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).

**Authorization**:
Determines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do. It decides access *after* identity is verified.

* Example phrases: "unauthorized access", "regular user can access admin panel", "role checks are missing"
* CWE relevance: use CWEs like 862, 863, 285 for authorization errors:

  * **CWE-862**: *Missing Authorization* – the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all.
  * **CWE-863**: *Incorrect Authorization* – the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).
  * **CWE-285**: *Improper Authorization* – general category for any flawed authorization logic or design.

**Access Control**:
A broader term that includes both authentication and authorization. Governs how resources are protected and who can access them under what conditions.

* CWE relevance:

  * **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* – top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear.
  * This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.

## Mapping Discussion – Common Misclassification Patterns

### 1. **CWE-306 vs CWE-862**:

* **306** is about lack of **authentication** (e.g., *no login required at all*).
* **862** is about lack of **authorization** *after* authentication (e.g., *admin check missing*).
* ✅ Example CWE-306: *“An unauthenticated attacker can invoke the password reset API.”*
* ✅ Example CWE-862: *“An authenticated user without admin privileges can delete any user account.”*

### 2. **CWE-285 vs CWE-284**:

* **285** is specific to authorization flaws – it's a better choice than 284 **if** the issue involves *improper or missing role checks*.
* **284** should be reserved for general access control issues when it’s unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.

---

## Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification

**Phrase like "unauthorized access" is not enough.**

* If you **cannot determine whether identity was checked**, assume it’s **authorization** and consider 862 or 863.
* If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** → CWE-306.
* If the **access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced**, but it's not due to missing checks, consider **CWE-284**.

---

## Good Mapping Examples

* ✅ **CWE-306**: “The endpoint `/admin/deleteUser` does not require any authentication.”
* ✅ **CWE-862**: “Any logged-in user can change any other user's email without being an admin.”
* ✅ **CWE-863**: “An admin check exists but incorrectly grants access to non-admin users.”
* ✅ **CWE-285**: “Application uses a static role check that fails when roles change dynamically.”
* ✅ **CWE-284**: “Inconsistent enforcement of access rules across services with unclear policy source.”

## Summary – Quick LLM Rules of Thumb

| **Indicator**                                              | **Likely CWE** |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| No identity check (no login)                               | CWE-306        |
| No role/privilege check after login                        | CWE-862        |
| Role check is present but flawed                           | CWE-863        |
| General or ambiguous authorization failure                 | CWE-285        |
| High-level access control problem with no clear root cause | CWE-284        |
