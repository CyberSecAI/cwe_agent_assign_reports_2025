  "description": "The OAuth Single Sign On SSO (OAuth Client) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in all versions up to, and including, 6.26.3. This is due to **insufficient verification** on the user being returned by the social login token. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator, if they have access to the username and the user does not have an already-existing account for the service returning the token.",

This **improper authentication** allows an unauthenticated attacker to bypass security checks and log in as any existing user.\n\nVulnerability Chain: **Insufficient Verification** (CWE-287) -> Authentication Bypass -> Unauthorized Access\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary focus of the analysis was on the **insufficient verification** of user data, which falls under the umbrella of authentication issues. The vulnerability allows attackers to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access.\n\nThe evidence supporting this assessment is derived directly from the vulnerability description. The description explicitly states that the vulnerability is due to **insufficient verification** on the user being returned by the social login token. This statement highlights that the core issue is related to how the plugin authenticates users after they log in via social platforms. The phrase \"authentication bypass\" further reinforces this interpretation.\n\n**CWE-287: Improper Authentication** is the most appropriate because the plugin attempts to authenticate users, but it does so incorrectly. This improper authentication leads to the vulnerability. While **CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function** could be considered, it is less accurate because the plugin does implement authentication, albeit flawed. **CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization** is also a possibility but is less accurate, as the primary issue is how the user is authenticated.\n\nThe selection of **CWE-287** as the primary CWE is at the optimal level of specificity. While there might be more specific CWEs related to social login or token validation, **CWE-287** captures the essence of the vulnerability, which is the **improper** handling of

Improper validation of data that are user-controllable can lead to the application processing incorrect, and often malicious, input.\n\n\nFor example, custom cookies commonly store session data or persistent data across sessions. This kind of session data is normally involved in security related decisions on the server side, such as user authentication and access control. Thus, the cookies might contain sensitive data such as user credentials and privileges. This is a dangerous practice, as it can often lead to improper reliance on the value of the client-provided cookie by the server side application.\n",
