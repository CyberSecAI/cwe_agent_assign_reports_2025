# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-39474

## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved mm/vmalloc fix vmalloc which may return null if called with __GFP_NOFAIL commit a421ef303008 (mm allow !GFP_KERNEL allocations for kvmalloc) includes support for __GFP_NOFAIL, but it presents a conflict with commit dd544141b9eb (vmalloc back off when the current task is OOM-killed). A possible scenario is as follows process-a __vmalloc_node_range(GFP_KERNEL | __GFP_NOFAIL) __vmalloc_area_node() vm_area_alloc_pages() --> oom-killer send SIGKILL to process-a if (fatal_signal_pending(current)) break --> return NULL To fix this, do not check fatal_signal_pending() in vm_area_alloc_pages() if __GFP_NOFAIL set. This issue occurred during OPLUS KASAN TEST. Below is part of the log -> oom-killer sends signal to process [65731.222840] [ T1308] oom-killconstraint=CONSTRAINT_NONE,nodemask=(null),cpuset=/,mems_allowed=0,global_oom,task_memcg=/apps/uid_10198,task=gs.intelligence,pid=32454,uid=10198 [65731.259685] [T32454] Call trace [65731.259698] [T32454] dump_backtrace+0xf4/0x118 [65731.259734] [T32454] show_stack+0x18/0x24 [65731.259756] [T32454] dump_stack_lvl+0x60/0x7c [65731.259781] [T32454] dump_stack+0x18/0x38 [65731.259800] [T32454] mrdump_common_die+0x250/0x39c [mrdump] [65731.259936] [T32454] ipanic_die+0x20/0x34 [mrdump] [65731.260019] [T32454] atomic_notifier_call_chain+0xb4/0xfc [65731.260047] [T32454] notify_die+0x114/0x198 [65731.260073] [T32454] die+0xf4/0x5

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **conflicting vmalloc behavior**
- **impact:** return null
- **product:** Linux kernel
- **component:** mm/vmalloc

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability arises from a conflict between two commits related to virtual memory allocation (`vmalloc`) in the Linux kernel. 
   - Commit `a421ef303008` introduced support for `__GFP_NOFAIL` flag for `kvmalloc`, allowing allocations even when the `GFP_KERNEL` flag isn't set. `__GFP_NOFAIL` means the allocation should not fail.
   - Commit `dd544141b9eb` implemented a mechanism for `vmalloc` to back off when the current task is being killed by the OOM (Out-of-Memory) killer. This is achieved by checking `fatal_signal_pending(current)`.

The conflict occurs because when `__GFP_NOFAIL` is set, the expectation is that the allocation will not fail but the code still checks for `fatal_signal_pending(current)` and will return NULL if a fatal signal is pending causing a NULL pointer dereference later.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Inconsistent Behavior with `__GFP_NOFAIL`:** The `vm_area_alloc_pages` function, when called with `__GFP_NOFAIL`, was still susceptible to returning `NULL` if a fatal signal was pending due to OOM killer, despite the `__GFP_NOFAIL` flag implying that the allocation should not fail.
- **NULL Pointer Dereference:**  Code relying on `kvmalloc` with `__GFP_NOFAIL` was not expecting a `NULL` return, leading to a potential NULL pointer dereference if the allocation failed due to the signal.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Kernel Panic:** The primary impact is a kernel panic due to the NULL pointer dereference. The provided log demonstrates that the `erofs` filesystem triggered this panic when it received a NULL pointer from `kvcalloc`.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A kernel panic results in a system crash, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **OOM Killer:** The vulnerability can be triggered when the OOM killer sends a fatal signal (`SIGKILL`) to a process that is in the middle of a `vmalloc` operation using `__GFP_NOFAIL`.
- **Memory Pressure:** The attack can be initiated by creating memory pressure on the system, causing the OOM killer to activate.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to induce memory pressure:** The attacker needs to be able to exhaust system memory to trigger the OOM killer.
- **Trigger a `vmalloc` using `__GFP_NOFAIL`:** The attacker must cause a process to request memory using `vmalloc` with the `__GFP_NOFAIL` flag when the OOM killer is active or about to be active.

**More Detail Than CVE Description:**

The provided content offers significantly more detail than a typical CVE description would:
   - Specific code snippets illustrating the problematic logic
   - A detailed explanation of the conflicting commits.
   - A concrete example (erofs) of how the issue can manifest, including the stack trace of a kernel panic.
   - The exact location in `vm_area_alloc_pages` and the specific code changes required to fix the vulnerability.
   - Detailed commit messages and the patch itself.
