  "query": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved mm/vmalloc fix vmalloc which may return null if called with __GFP_NOFAIL commit a421ef303008 (mm allow !GFP_KERNEL allocations for kvmalloc) includes support for __GFP_NOFAIL, but it presents a conflict with commit dd544141b9eb (vmalloc back off when the current task is OOM-killed). A possible scenario is as follows process-a __vmalloc_node_range(GFP_KERNEL | __GFP_NOFAIL) __vmalloc_area_node() vm_area_alloc_pages() --> oom-killer send SIGKILL to process-a if (fatal_signal_pending(current)) break --> return NULL To fix this, do not check fatal_signal_pending() in vm_area_alloc_pages() if __GFP_NOFAIL set.
