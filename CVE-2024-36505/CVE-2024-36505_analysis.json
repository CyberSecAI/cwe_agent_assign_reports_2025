While it is generally discouraged to use high-level CWEs if more specific ones are available, in this case, the vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"**improper access control**,\" making it a reasonable choice based on the available information. The Retriever results also list CWE-284, but with a discouraged usage. However, since the description clearly states \"**improper access control**,\" and the provided guidance suggests using it when the root cause is unclear, it remains the most appropriate selection.\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe284 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an attacker gaining write access to the underlying system (likely through another vulnerability). This initial access then allows the attacker to bypass the file integrity checking system due to **improper access control** [CWE-284].\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly points to CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) as the primary weakness. The vulnerability description explicitly uses the phrase \"**improper access control**\", which aligns directly with the CWE's definition. While more specific CWEs like CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) or CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) were considered, the description does not provide enough detail to pinpoint the exact nature of the access control failure. Therefore, CWE-284, as a high-level category for general access control issues, is the most appropriate choice. The decision is heavily based on the provided evidence and the guidance to use CWE-284 when the root cause is unclear.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions. This may cause it to follow unexpected code paths that may leave the product in an invalid state.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
