A vulnerability present starting in version 3.0.5 up to and including version 4.6.3 allows an attacker to impersonate any user during SAML authentication by tampering with a valid SAML response. This can be done by adding attributes to the response. Users are affected specifically when the service provider is using `passport-wsfed-saml2` and a valid SAML Response signed by the Identity Provider can be obtained. Version 4.6.4 contains a fix for the vulnerability. Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-1390 CWE-290 CWE-613 CWE-347 CWE-488 CWE-1270 CWE-384 CWE-287 CWE-308",
