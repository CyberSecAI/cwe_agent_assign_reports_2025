## Vulnerability Description
A flaw was found in Aardvark-dns, which is vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack due to the **serial processing of TCP DNS queries**. An attacker can exploit this flaw by keeping a TCP connection open indefinitely, causing the server to become unresponsive and resulting in other DNS queries timing out. This issue prevents legitimate users from accessing DNS services, thereby disrupting normal operations and causing service downtime.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **serial processing of TCP DNS queries**
- **impact:** Denial of Service attack
- **vector:** keeping a TCP connection open indefinitely
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** Aardvark-dns

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-8418:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how `aardvark-dns` (versions 1.12.0 and 1.12.1) handles TCP DNS queries. It processes these queries serially, meaning it handles them one after another instead of concurrently.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Serial TCP processing:**  Aardvark-dns processes TCP DNS requests one at a time.
- **Lack of connection management:** The service does not properly handle persistent TCP connections and lacks timeouts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can establish a TCP connection and send very little or no data, effectively holding the connection open indefinitely. This blocks the service from processing new DNS queries from other clients.
- **Unresponsive Server:**  The server becomes unresponsive due to the blocked connection(s).
- **DNS Query Timeouts:** Legitimate DNS queries start timing out, causing service downtime and preventing users from accessing DNS services.
- **Disrupted Operations:** The DoS attack disrupts normal operations by making DNS services unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious TCP Client:** An attacker needs to be able to establish a TCP connection to the `aardvark-dns` service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:**  The attacker needs network access to reach the aardvark-dns service and open a TCP connection.
- **Ability to send TCP packets:** The attacker needs to be able to send TCP packets and keep a connection open to the service.

**Additional Details:**
-  The vulnerability is specific to TCP queries, UDP requests are processed differently.
- The fix for the vulnerability involves processing TCP requests concurrently and adding a timeout to TCP connections.
- The issue was reported as impacting podman containers where DNS resolution would stop working after some time due to the aardvark-dns service becoming unresponsive.
- The fix was implemented by spawning a new task for each new TCP connection and adding a 3-second timeout to all TCP connections, preventing clients from holding connections open indefinitely.
