# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-35235

## Vulnerability Description
OpenPrinting CUPS is an open source printing system for Linux and other Unix-like operating systems. In versions 2.4.8 and earlier, when starting the cupsd server with a Listen configuration item pointing to a symbolic link, the cupsd process can be caused to perform an **arbitrary chmod** of the provided argument, providing world-writable access to the target. Given that cupsd is often running as root, this can result in the change of permission of any user or system files to be world writable. Given the aforementioned Ubuntu AppArmor context, on such systems this vulnerability is limited to those files modifiable by the cupsd process. In that specific case it was found to be possible to turn the configuration of the Listen argument into full control over the cupsd.conf and cups-files.conf configuration files. By later setting the User and Group arguments in cups-files.conf, and printing with a printer configured by PPD with a `FoomaticRIPCommandLine` argument, arbitrary user and group (not root) command execution could be achieved, which can further be used on Ubuntu systems to achieve full root command execution. Commit ff1f8a623e090dee8a8aadf12a6a4b25efac143d contains a patch for the issue.

```
{
  "cve": "CVE-2024-35235",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    {
      "root_cause": "The `cupsd` server, when configured with a `Listen` directive pointing to a symbolic link, attempts to `unlink` the target path and then bind to it as a domain socket. If either operation fails, due to, for example, AppArmor preventing the `unlink` on a symlink, or a race condition where the symlink is recreated before the bind, the server will proceed to change the file permissions of the target to world-writable using `chmod`, even if the binding failed.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The code does not properly check the return value of `unlink` and `bind` before proceeding to `chmod`.",
        "The code uses `chmod` on a path controlled by the user, not an explicit file descriptor, which could result in modification of an unintended target if the path is a symlink."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can cause the `cupsd` process to perform an arbitrary `chmod` operation, making any file world writable if they can cause a bind to a symbolic link to fail. Since `cupsd` often runs as root, this can be leveraged to escalate privileges.",
      "attack_vectors": "The attack requires modifying the `/etc/cups/cupsd.conf` file to contain a `Listen` directive with a path that resolves to a symbolic link. This can be done via a race condition or with a separate vulnerability that allows writing to the configuration file.",
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker requires the ability to modify the `cupsd.conf` file to include a malicious `Listen` directive. They also need to be able to trigger a situation where the `unlink` and/or `bind` call fails, such as by planting a symlink in a location that will be later be called by `bind`."
    }
  ],
  "additional_details": {
     "vulnerability_chain": "This vulnerability was found as part of a larger chain in Ubuntu 24.04, where the ability to make arbitrary files world-writable leads to further vulnerabilities including the capability to execute commands with specific users and groups. This was achieved by modifying the cupsd.conf and cups-files.conf configuration files and using a FoomaticRIPCommandLine printer config. The issue is compounded by a race condition where a symlink can be created after the initial unlink, ensuring the bind fails and the chmod occurs.",
     "fix_description": "The suggested fix includes opening the configured paths using `openat` with `O_NOFOLLOW`, followed by using `fchmod` in place of `chmod`. Additionally, the return value of the `bind` call should be checked before proceeding to `chmod`.",
    "debug_print_issues":"The use of `DEBUG_printf` without saving and restoring `errno` might make the `errno == ENOENT` check unreliable as `DEBUG_printf` itself can overwrite it."

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* 🔍 *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* 🔍 *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion – CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### 🔸 CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ✅ *“A user created with the ‘guest’ role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ✅ *“The backup service runs as root but only needs read access.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ⚠️ This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### 🔸 CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ✅ *“User can access another user’s invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.”*

## Mapping Examples – Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *“User can escalate privileges to admin.”*
> ❌ Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged – only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ✅ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**

## Good Mapping Examples – Privileges & Permissions

* ✅ **CWE-266**: *“When a new user registers, the system assigns them admin role due to a missing role validation.”*
* ✅ **CWE-250**: *“Installer runs with system-level privileges but doesn't require them to install files in the user directory.”*
* ✅ **CWE-284**: *“Inconsistent access rules between UI and backend for sensitive endpoints.”*
* ✅ **CWE-285**: *“Authorization logic fails to restrict access to finance reports based on department.”*
