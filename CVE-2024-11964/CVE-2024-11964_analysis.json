The retriever results strongly support CWE-89 as the primary classification. While other CWEs like CWE-79 (Cross-Site Scripting) and CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')) were considered due to their presence in the retriever results, they don't accurately reflect the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **improper handling of SQL commands**.
