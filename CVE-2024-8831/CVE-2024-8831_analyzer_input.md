# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-8831

## Vulnerability Description
PDF-XChange Editor XPS File Parsing **Out-Of-Bounds Read** Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of PDF-XChange Editor. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of XPS files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-24316.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of XPS files within PDF-XChange Editor. This lack of validation can lead to a read operation that goes beyond the boundaries of an allocated buffer.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The core weakness is an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. This occurs due to insufficient input validation when processing XPS files.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process running the vulnerable PDF-XChange Editor. This could lead to complete control of the system for the attacker.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector involves crafting a malicious XPS file. A user needs to open this malicious file or visit a malicious webpage that triggers the parsing of the crafted XPS file within the PDF-XChange editor.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to create a specially crafted XPS file. The attacker needs to entice a user of PDF-XChange editor to open this malicious file or visit a malicious webpage that will trigger the processing of the XPS file.
