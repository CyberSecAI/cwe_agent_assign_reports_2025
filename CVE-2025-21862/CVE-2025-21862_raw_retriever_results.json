This will call the net_dm_monitor_start() function that uses a spinlock that has not yet been initialized. To fix this, lets place resource initialization above the registration of a generic netlink family. Found by InfoTeCS on behalf of Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with Syzkaller.",
