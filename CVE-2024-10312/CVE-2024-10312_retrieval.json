This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to extract sensitive private, pending, and draft template data.', key_phrases={'rootcause': '', 'weakness': ['Sensitive Information Exposure', 'information disclosure'], 'impact': 'extract sensitive template data', 'vector': 'render function', 'attacker': 'authenticated attackers with Contributor-level access and above', 'product': 'Exclusive Addons for Elementor plugin for WordPress', 'version': 'up to and including 2.7.4', 'component': 'elements/tabs/tabs.php'}, reference_content='Based on the provided information, here\\'s a breakdown of the vulnerability:\\n\\n**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-10312\\n\\n**Root Cause:**\\nThe vulnerability stems from the way the \"Exclusive Addons for Elementor\" plugin handles the rendering of Elementor templates within its Tabs widget. Specifically, the plugin was not properly checking the publication status of the template before displaying it within the tab content.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\\n- **Insecure Direct Object Reference:** The plugin directly used the template ID provided in the tab settings to fetch and display the template content. This allowed users with sufficient permissions to access and render content from templates that were not intended to be publicly visible.\\n- **Sensitive Information Exposure:** By directly rendering the template content without proper status checks, the plugin leaked sensitive information from unpublished (draft, pending, private) Elementor templates.\\n\\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\\n- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers with Contributor-level access or higher could gain access to sensitive data within private, pending, and draft Elementor templates that were not meant to be public.\\n\\n**Attack Vectors:**\\n- The vulnerability is present in the `elements/tabs/tabs.php` file.\\n- Attackers would need to be authenticated users with Contributor-level access or higher.\\n- They would need to craft or edit the settings of a Tabs widget to reference a private/draft template.\\n- When the page containing the Tabs widget is rendered, the plugin will display the content of the referenced template, regardless of its status\\n\\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\\n- The attacker needs to be a registered user on the WordPress site.\\n- They must have at least \"Contributor\" level permissions.\\n- The attacker needs to have access to the Elementor interface and be able to edit or create content that uses the \"Exclusive Addons for Elementor\" Tabs widget.\\n- No specific network position is required, as the vulnerability is exploitable from the frontend of the website.\\n\\n**More details than the CVE description:**\\n- The provided content provides more specific details about the vulnerable code, pinpointing the exact location of the issue (`elements/tabs/tabs.php`) and the specific function `get_builder_content_for_display`.\\n- It also clearly outlines that the fix involves checking the post status before displaying the template content ( `if ( \\'publish\\' === get_post_status( $tab[\\'exad_tab_content_save_template\\'] ) )` ).\\n\\n**Remediation:**\\n- The vulnerability is fixed in version 2.7.5 of the plugin. Users are advised to update to this version or a newer patched version.', similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [],
