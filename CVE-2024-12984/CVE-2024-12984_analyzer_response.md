# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-200 | Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor | 0.7 | Class |  Primary CWE | Allowed-with-Review |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7
*   **Evidence Strength:** LOW

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship considered was the parent-child relationship. CWE-200 is a Class-level CWE, and while more specific Base or Variant level CWEs are preferred, the provided information does not give enough information to choose a more specific CWE.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with a **problematic vulnerability** in the Web Interface component, leading to the **impact** of information disclosure. The exact nature of the initial flaw is unknown.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is based primarily on the provided vulnerability description, which states that the manipulation of the `/web_caps/webCapsConfig` file in the Web Interface leads to information disclosure. The lack of specific details about the **root cause** makes it challenging to pinpoint the exact nature of the vulnerability.

CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) is the most fitting CWE, as it directly aligns with the described impact. While CWE-200 is a Class-level CWE, the absence of further details prevents mapping to a more specific Base or Variant.

Other CWEs were considered but ultimately rejected:

*   CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')), CWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')), CWE-78 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')), and CWE-502 (Deserialization of Untrusted Data): These CWEs relate to input validation and injection vulnerabilities, which are not explicitly mentioned in the vulnerability description.
*   CWE-425 (Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')): While this could be a contributing factor, the primary impact is information disclosure, making CWE-200 more relevant.

The selection of CWE-200 is at an appropriate level of specificity given the limited information available. More details about the **root cause** would enable a more precise mapping.

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*   **Why Not Selected:** This is more specific to the system level, while the provided information focuses on the web interface.

## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*   **Why Not Selected:** The primary impact is information disclosure, not necessarily unauthorized access.

## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

*   **Why Not Selected:** There's no mention of weak credentials in the description.

## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as "<", ">", and "&" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*   **Why Not Selected:** There's no indication of XSS in the description.

## CWE-134: Use of Externally-Controlled Format String
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a function that accepts a format string as an argument, but the format string originates from an external source.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*   **Why Not Selected:** There's no indication of format string vulnerability in the description.

## CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product establishes a communication channel to (or from) an endpoint for privileged or protected operations, but it does not properly ensure that it is communicating with the correct endpoint.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

*   **Why Not Selected:** This relates to communication channels, which aren't explicitly mentioned.

## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*   **Why Not Selected:** While possible, the description doesn't focus on improper removal of sensitive information.

## CWE-294: Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A capture-replay flaw exists when the design of the product makes it possible for a malicious user to sniff network traffic and bypass authentication by replaying it to the server in question to the same effect as the original message (or with minor changes).

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*   **Why Not Selected:** No mention of authentication bypass.
