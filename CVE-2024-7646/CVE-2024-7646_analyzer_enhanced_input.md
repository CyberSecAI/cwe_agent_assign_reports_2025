## Vulnerability Description
A security issue was discovered in ingress-nginx where an actor with permission to create Ingress objects (in the `networking.k8s.io` or `extensions` API group) can bypass annotation validation to inject arbitrary commands and obtain the credentials of the ingress-nginx controller. In the default configuration, that credential has access to all secrets in the cluster.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** arbitrary command execution
- **vector:** bypass annotation validation
- **attacker:** actor with permission to create Ingress objects
- **product:** ingress-nginx

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-7646:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a bypass in the annotation validation within ingress-nginx. Specifically, an attacker can inject carriage return characters (`\r`) into Ingress object annotations, which are then not properly sanitized by the ingress-nginx controller. This allows the attacker to inject arbitrary commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Annotation Validation Bypass:** The ingress-nginx controller fails to properly sanitize or validate annotations, allowing the injection of malicious characters like carriage returns.
*   **Command Injection:** The injected characters enable the execution of arbitrary commands on the system hosting the ingress-nginx controller.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Credential Theft:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain access to the credentials of the ingress-nginx controller.
*   **Full Cluster Compromise:** In a default configuration, the compromised credentials have access to all secrets within the Kubernetes cluster, potentially leading to a full compromise of the cluster.
*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the ingress-nginx controller.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Ingress Object Creation:** An attacker needs the permission to create Ingress objects within the Kubernetes cluster.
*   **Malicious Annotations:** The attack involves creating Ingress objects with malicious annotations containing carriage return characters (`\r`).
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Kubernetes API server to create the Ingress object.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Kubernetes Access:** The attacker must have the ability to create Ingress objects, typically in the `networking.k8s.io` or `extensions` API group, within the Kubernetes cluster. This implies some level of authorized access to the cluster, though not necessarily admin-level access.
*  **Multi-tenant environment:**  Multi-tenant environments where non-admin users have permissions to create Ingress objects are most affected by this issue.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Versions:**  ingress-nginx controller versions prior to v1.11.2 and v1.10.4 are vulnerable.
*   **Mitigation:** The vulnerability can be mitigated by upgrading ingress-nginx controller to versions v1.11.2 or v1.10.4.
*   **Detection:** Reviewing Kubernetes audit logs for Ingress objects created with annotations containing carriage returns (`\r`) is a way to detect potential exploitation.
*   The fix involves making the auth verify regex more strict and cleaning operations on line breaks.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* 🔍 *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* 🔍 *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion – CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### 🔸 CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ✅ *“A user created with the ‘guest’ role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ✅ *“The backup service runs as root but only needs read access.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ⚠️ This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### 🔸 CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ✅ *“User can access another user’s invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.”*

## Mapping Examples – Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *“User can escalate privileges to admin.”*
> ❌ Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged – only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ✅ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**

| “Unauthorized read/write to file”           | Permission control issue              | CWE-285                                      |
| “Can access resource without correct role”  | Incorrect or missing permission check | CWE-285, 862, 863                            |

## Good Mapping Examples – Privileges & Permissions

* ✅ **CWE-266**: *“When a new user registers, the system assigns them admin role due to a missing role validation.”*
* ✅ **CWE-250**: *“Installer runs with system-level privileges but doesn't require them to install files in the user directory.”*
* ✅ **CWE-284**: *“Inconsistent access rules between UI and backend for sensitive endpoints.”*
* ✅ **CWE-285**: *“Authorization logic fails to restrict access to finance reports based on department.”*
