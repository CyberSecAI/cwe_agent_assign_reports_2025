vectors:** An attacker with full access to their namespace can retrieve the ServiceAccount token.\\n    *   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs full access to the namespace

    "enhanced_query": "# Vulnerability Description\n\n    A flaw was found in Tempo Operator, where it **creates a ServiceAccount**, **ClusterRole**, **and **ClusterRole**Binding** when a user deploys a TempoStack or TempoMonolithic instance. This flaw allows a user with full access to their namespace to extract the ServiceAccount token and use it to submit TokenReview and SubjectAccessReview requests, potentially revealing information about other users permissions. While this does not allow privilege escalation or impersonation, it exposes information that could aid in gathering information for further attacks.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## WEAKNESS: 'creates a ServiceAccount'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this WEAKNESS:\n\n### 1.
