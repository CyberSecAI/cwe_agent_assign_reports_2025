Given that the attack vector involves physical access and interruption of the boot process, CWE-1263 is a relevant secondary consideration, though not a direct cause. The abstraction levels are appropriate, with both CWEs at the Base level.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe1263[\"CWE-1263: Improper Physical Access Control\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe287 primary\n    class cwe1263 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with physical access to the machine, followed by the ability to interrupt the normal boot process. This allows an unauthorized user to bypass authentication and gain access.\n- Root Cause: **Improper Authentication (CWE-287)** - The system fails to properly authenticate the user after the boot process is interrupted.\n- Contributing Factor: **Improper Physical Access Control (CWE-1263)** - Physical access to the machine allows for the boot process to be interrupted.\n- Impact: Authentication Bypass\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is **Improper Authentication (CWE-287)**, as the core issue is the failure to properly authenticate the user after the boot process is interrupted. The vulnerability description clearly states \"**Improper Authentication vulnerability** exists that could cause an Authentication Bypass when an unauthorized user without permission rights has physical access to the EPAS-UI computer and is able to reboot the workstation and interrupt the normal boot process.\" This maps directly to the definition of CWE-287: \"When an actor claims to have a given identity, the product does not prove or insufficiently proves that the claim is correct.\"\n\nWhile physical access is a contributing factor, it is not the root cause of the authentication bypass. The system should still require proper authentication even if the boot process is interrupted. Therefore, **Improper Physical Access Control (CWE-1263)** is a secondary consideration.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-287 is a Base level CWE, which is the preferred level of abstraction for mapping to root causes.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product requires authentication, but the product has an alternate path or channel that does not require authentication.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-657: Violation of Secure Design Principles\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product violates well-established principles for secure design.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
