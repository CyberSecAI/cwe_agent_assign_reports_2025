## Vulnerability Description
A command for refining a collection shard key is missing an authorization check. This may cause the command to run directly on a shard, leading to either degradation of query performance, or to revealing chunk boundaries through timing side channels. This affects MongoDB Server v5.0 versions, prior to 5.0.22, MongoDB Server v6.0 versions, prior to 6.0.11 and MongoDB Server v7.0 versions prior to 7.0.3.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **missing authorization check**
- **impact:** degradation of query performance and revealing chunk boundaries through timing side channels
- **product:** MongoDB Server
- **version:** v5.0 versions, prior to 5.0.22, v6.0 versions, prior to 6.0.11 and v7.0 versions prior to 7.0.3
- **component:** command for refining a collection shard key

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content is related to CVE-2024-6375.

**Root Cause:** A command for refining a collection shard key is missing an authorization check.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Missing authorization check in the command for refining a collection shard key.
- This allows the command to be executed directly on a shard without proper authorization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Degradation of query performance.
- Revealing chunk boundaries through timing side channels.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Executing the vulnerable command on a shard without proper authorization.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have low-privileged access (PR:L) to execute commands.
- The attack can be done over the network (AV:N)
- The attacker does not need user interaction (UI:N)

**Affected Versions:**
- MongoDB Server v5.0 versions prior to 5.0.22
- MongoDB Server v6.0 versions prior to 6.0.11
- MongoDB Server v7.0 versions prior to 7.0.3

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control

**Authentication**:
Determines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.

* Example phrases: "user must log in", "lack of login check", "bypasses login"
* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.

  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* – used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).

**Authorization**:
Determines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do. It decides access *after* identity is verified.

* Example phrases: "unauthorized access", "regular user can access admin panel", "role checks are missing"
* CWE relevance: use CWEs like 862, 863, 285 for authorization errors:

  * **CWE-862**: *Missing Authorization* – the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all.
  * **CWE-863**: *Incorrect Authorization* – the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).
  * **CWE-285**: *Improper Authorization* – general category for any flawed authorization logic or design.

**Access Control**:
A broader term that includes both authentication and authorization. Governs how resources are protected and who can access them under what conditions.

* CWE relevance:

  * **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* – top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear.
  * This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.

## Mapping Discussion – Common Misclassification Patterns

### 1. **CWE-306 vs CWE-862**:

* **306** is about lack of **authentication** (e.g., *no login required at all*).
* **862** is about lack of **authorization** *after* authentication (e.g., *admin check missing*).
* ✅ Example CWE-306: *“An unauthenticated attacker can invoke the password reset API.”*
* ✅ Example CWE-862: *“An authenticated user without admin privileges can delete any user account.”*

### 2. **CWE-285 vs CWE-284**:

* **285** is specific to authorization flaws – it's a better choice than 284 **if** the issue involves *improper or missing role checks*.
* **284** should be reserved for general access control issues when it’s unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.

---

## Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification

**Phrase like "unauthorized access" is not enough.**

* If you **cannot determine whether identity was checked**, assume it’s **authorization** and consider 862 or 863.
* If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** → CWE-306.
* If the **access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced**, but it's not due to missing checks, consider **CWE-284**.

---

## Good Mapping Examples

* ✅ **CWE-306**: “The endpoint `/admin/deleteUser` does not require any authentication.”
* ✅ **CWE-862**: “Any logged-in user can change any other user's email without being an admin.”
* ✅ **CWE-863**: “An admin check exists but incorrectly grants access to non-admin users.”
* ✅ **CWE-285**: “Application uses a static role check that fails when roles change dynamically.”
* ✅ **CWE-284**: “Inconsistent enforcement of access rules across services with unclear policy source.”

## Summary – Quick LLM Rules of Thumb

| **Indicator**                                              | **Likely CWE** |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| No identity check (no login)                               | CWE-306        |
| No role/privilege check after login                        | CWE-862        |
| Role check is present but flawed                           | CWE-863        |
| General or ambiguous authorization failure                 | CWE-285        |
| High-level access control problem with no clear root cause | CWE-284        |
