## Vulnerability Description
Pimcores Admin Classic Bundle provides a backend user interface for Pimcore. Navigating to `/admin/index/statistics` with a logged in Pimcore user exposes information about the Pimcore installation, PHP version, MYSQL version, installed bundles and all database tables and their row count in the system. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.5.2, 1.4.6, and 1.3.10.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **product:** Pimcores Admin Classic Bundle
- **component:** /admin/index/statistics endpoint

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-41109:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `/admin/index/statistics` endpoint in pimcore/admin-ui-classic-bundle was accessible to any logged-in Pimcore user, and it disclosed sensitive system and database information. This was due to missing proper authorization checks before returning the statistics data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The endpoint exposed detailed information about the Pimcore installation, including:
    - Pimcore version, major version, hash, and platform version.
    - PHP version.
    - MySQL/MariaDB version.
    - List of all installed bundles.
    - List of all database tables and their row counts.
- **Missing Authorization:** The vulnerability existed because the endpoint did not adequately check user permissions before disclosing the sensitive information. The initial check only prevented XmlHttpRequests, but not direct browser access by logged-in users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker who has valid Pimcore user credentials (even with low privileges) can gain access to the detailed system and database information, which can potentially aid in further attacks.
- **Increased Attack Surface:** The disclosed information can reveal potential vulnerabilities in the environment, increasing the attack surface for malicious actors.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited over the network.
- **Direct HTTP Request:** A logged-in Pimcore user can navigate directly to the `/admin/index/statistics` endpoint using a web browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Pimcore User Credentials:** The attacker needs to have valid user credentials for the Pimcore system. Low privilege user accounts are sufficient to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is present in versions <=1.5.1 of `pimcore/admin-ui-classic-bundle` and also in `pimcore/ee-admin-ui-classic-bundle` with the versions mentioned above.
- The vulnerability is fixed in versions 1.5.2 (and corresponding versions of ee-admin-ui-classic-bundle)
- The fix implemented an authorization check to ensure that only admin users or users with specific permission can access the `/admin/index/statistics` endpoint.

This is a clear information disclosure vulnerability due to missing authorization checks, allowing logged in users to access sensitive system information.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-1336: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses a template engine to insert or process externally-influenced input, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements or syntax that can be interpreted as template expressions or other code directives when processed by the engine.

### Extended Description


Many web applications use template engines that allow developers to insert externally-influenced values into free text or messages in order to generate a full web page, document, message, etc. Such engines include Twig, Jinja2, Pug, Java Server Pages, FreeMarker, Velocity, ColdFusion, Smarty, and many others - including PHP itself. Some CMS (Content Management Systems) also use templates.


Template engines often have their own custom command or expression language. If an attacker can influence input into a template before it is processed, then the attacker can invoke arbitrary expressions, i.e. perform injection attacks. For example, in some template languages, an attacker could inject the expression "{{7*7}}" and determine if the output returns "49" instead. The syntax varies depending on the language.


In some cases, XSS-style attacks can work, which can obscure the root cause if the developer does not closely investigate the root cause of the error.


Template engines can be used on the server or client, so both "sides" could be affected by injection. The mechanisms of attack or the affected technologies might be different, but the mistake is fundamentally the same.


### Alternative Terms
Server-Side Template Injection / SSTI: This term is used for injection into template engines being used by a server.
Client-Side Template Injection / CSTI: This term is used for injection into template engines being used by a client.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-94

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Since expression languages are often used in templating languages, there may be some overlap with CWE-917 (Expression Language Injection). XSS (CWE-79) is also co-located with template injection.

**[Maintenance]** The interrelationships and differences between CWE-917 and CWE-1336 need to be further clarified.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2024-34359:** Chain: Python bindings for LLM library do not use a sandboxed environment when parsing a template and constructing a prompt, allowing jinja2 Server Side Template Injection and code execution - one variant of a "prompt injection" attack.
- **CVE-2017-16783:** server-side template injection in content management server
- **CVE-2020-9437:** authentication / identity management product has client-side template injection




## CWE-95: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection')
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes code syntax before using the input in a dynamic evaluation call (e.g. "eval").

### Extended Description
This may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code, or at least modify what code can be executed.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-94

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Other]** Factors: special character errors can play a role in increasing the variety of code that can be injected, although some vulnerabilities do not require special characters at all, e.g. when a single function without arguments can be referenced and a terminator character is not necessary.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2024-4181:** Framework for LLM applications allows eval injection via a crafted response from a hosting provider.
- **CVE-2022-2054:** Python compiler uses eval() to execute malicious strings as Python code.
- **CVE-2021-22204:** Chain: regex in EXIF processor code does not correctly determine where a string ends (CWE-625), enabling eval injection (CWE-95), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.




## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
AuthZ: "AuthZ" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authorization" within the web application security community. It is distinct from "AuthN" (or, sometimes, "AuthC") which is an abbreviation of "authentication." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-285
ChildOf -> CWE-284

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Additional Notes
**[Terminology]** 

Assuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-39155:** Chain: A microservice integration and management platform compares the hostname in the HTTP Host header in a case-sensitive way (CWE-178, CWE-1289), allowing bypass of the authorization policy (CWE-863) using a hostname with mixed case or other variations.
- **CVE-2019-15900:** Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).
- **CVE-2009-2213:** Gateway uses default "Allow" configuration for its authorization settings.




## CWE-1188: Initialization of a Resource with an Insecure Default
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product initializes or sets a resource with a default that is intended to be changed by the administrator, but the default is not secure.

### Extended Description


Developers often choose default values that leave the product as open and easy to use as possible out-of-the-box, under the assumption that the administrator can (or should) change the default value. However, this ease-of-use comes at a cost when the default is insecure and the administrator does not change it.


### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-1419
ChildOf -> CWE-665

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** This entry improves organization of concepts under initialization. The typical CWE model is to cover "Missing" and "Incorrect" behaviors. Arguably, this entry could be named as "Incorrect" instead of "Insecure." This might be changed in the near future.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-36349:** insecure default variable initialization in BIOS firmware for a hardware board allows DoS
- **CVE-2022-42467:** A generic database browser interface has a default mode that exposes a web server to the network, allowing queries to the database.

**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not perform any authentication for functionality that requires a provable user identity or consumes a significant amount of resources.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-287
ChildOf -> CWE-287

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-31260:** Chain: a digital asset management program has an undisclosed backdoor in the legacy version of a PHP script (CWE-912) that could allow an unauthenticated user to export metadata (CWE-306)
- **CVE-2022-29951:** TCP-based protocol in Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) has no authentication.
- **CVE-2022-29952:** Condition Monitor firmware uses a protocol that does not require authentication.




## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component. Without sufficient removal or quoting of SQL syntax in user-controllable inputs, the generated SQL query can cause those inputs to be interpreted as SQL instead of ordinary user data.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
SQL injection: a common attack-oriented phrase
SQLi: a common abbreviation for "SQL injection"

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-943
ChildOf -> CWE-74

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** SQL injection can be resultant from special character mismanagement, MAID, or denylist/allowlist problems. It can be primary to authentication errors.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2023-32530:** SQL injection in security product dashboard using crafted certificate fields
- **CVE-2021-42258:** SQL injection in time and billing software, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2021-27101:** SQL injection in file-transfer system via a crafted Host header, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.




## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Denylist / Deny List: This is used by CWE and CAPEC instead of other commonly-used terms. Its counterpart is allowlist.
Blocklist / Block List: This is often used by security tools such as firewalls, email or web gateways, proxies, etc.
Blacklist / Black List: This term is frequently used, but usage has been declining as organizations have started to adopt other terms.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-693
ChildOf -> CWE-1023
CanPrecede -> CWE-79
CanPrecede -> CWE-78
CanPrecede -> CWE-434
CanPrecede -> CWE-98

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** 

Multiple interpretation errors can indirectly introduce inputs that should be disallowed. For example, a list of dangerous shell metacharacters might not include a metacharacter that only has meaning in one particular shell, not all of them; or a check for XSS manipulations might ignore an unusual construct that is supported by one web browser, but not others.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2024-4315:** Chain: API for text generation using Large Language Models (LLMs) does not include the "\" Windows folder separator in its denylist (CWE-184) when attempting to prevent Local File Inclusion via path traversal (CWE-22), allowing deletion of arbitrary files on Windows systems.
- **CVE-2008-2309:** product uses a denylist to identify potentially dangerous content, allowing attacker to bypass a warning
- **CVE-2005-2782:** PHP remote file inclusion in web application that filters "http" and "https" URLs, but not "ftp".




## CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product specifies permissions for a security-critical resource in a way that allows that resource to be read or modified by unintended actors.

### Extended Description
When a resource is given a permission setting that provides access to a wider range of actors than required, it could lead to the exposure of sensitive information, or the modification of that resource by unintended parties. This is especially dangerous when the resource is related to program configuration, execution, or sensitive user data. For example, consider a misconfigured storage account for the cloud that can be read or written by a public or anonymous user.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-285
ChildOf -> CWE-668

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** While the name itself indicates an assignment of permissions for resources, this is often misused for vulnerabilities in which "permissions" are not checked, which is an "authorization" weakness (CWE-285 or descendants) within CWE's model [REF-1287].
**Comments:** Closely analyze the specific mistake that is allowing the resource to be exposed, and perform a CWE mapping for that mistake.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** The relationships between privileges, permissions, and actors (e.g. users and groups) need further refinement within the Research view. One complication is that these concepts apply to two different pillars, related to control of resources (CWE-664) and protection mechanism failures (CWE-693).



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-29527:** Go application for cloud management creates a world-writable sudoers file that allows local attackers to inject sudo rules and escalate privileges to root by winning a race condition.
- **CVE-2009-3482:** Anti-virus product sets insecure "Everyone: Full Control" permissions for files under the "Program Files" folder, allowing attackers to replace executables with Trojan horses.
- **CVE-2009-3897:** Product creates directories with 0777 permissions at installation, allowing users to gain privileges and access a socket used for authentication.




## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-200
CanAlsoBe -> CWE-209
CanAlsoBe -> CWE-202

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Other]** Sensitive information could include data that is sensitive in and of itself (such as credentials or private messages), or otherwise useful in the further exploitation of the system (such as internal file system structure).



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-0708:** Collaboration platform does not clear team emails in a response, allowing leak of email addresses




## CWE-287: Improper Authentication
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
When an actor claims to have a given identity, the product does not prove or insufficiently proves that the claim is correct.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
authentification: An alternate term is "authentification", which appears to be most commonly used by people from non-English-speaking countries.
AuthN: "AuthN" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authentication" within the web application security community. It is also distinct from "AuthZ," which is an abbreviation of "authorization." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.
AuthC: "AuthC" is used as an abbreviation of "authentication," but it appears to used less frequently than "AuthN."

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-284
ChildOf -> CWE-284

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** This CWE entry might be misused when lower-level CWE entries are likely to be applicable. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
**Comments:** Consider children or descendants, beginning with CWE-1390: Weak Authentication or CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse
**Suggested Alternatives:**
- CWE-1390: Weak Authentication
- CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This can be resultant from SQL injection vulnerabilities and other issues.

**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-35248:** Chat application skips validation when Central Authentication Service (CAS) is enabled, effectively removing the second factor from two-factor authentication
- **CVE-2022-36436:** Python-based authentication proxy does not enforce password authentication during the initial handshake, allowing the client to bypass authentication by specifying a 'None' authentication type.
- **CVE-2022-30034:** Chain: Web UI for a Python RPC framework does not use regex anchors to validate user login emails (CWE-777), potentially allowing bypass of OAuth (CWE-1390).
