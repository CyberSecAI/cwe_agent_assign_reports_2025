  "description": "Pimcores Admin Classic Bundle provides a backend user interface for Pimcore. Navigating to `/admin/index/statistics` with a logged in Pimcore user exposes information about the Pimcore installation, PHP version, MYSQL version, installed bundles and all database tables and their row count in the system. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.5.2, 1.4.6, and 1.3.10.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-41109:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n- The `/admin/index/statistics` endpoint in pimcore/admin-ui-classic-bundle was accessible to any logged-in Pimcore user, and it disclosed sensitive system and database information. This was due to missing proper authorization checks before returning the statistics data.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Information Disclosure:** The endpoint exposed detailed information about the Pimcore installation, including:\n    - Pimcore version, major version, hash, and platform version.\n    - PHP version.\n    - MySQL/MariaDB version.\n    - List of all installed bundles.\n    - List of all database tables and their row counts.\n- **Missing Authorization:** The vulnerability existed because the endpoint did not adequately check user permissions before disclosing the sensitive information. The initial check only prevented XmlHttpRequests, but not direct browser access by logged-in users.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker who has valid Pimcore user credentials (even with low privileges) can gain access to the detailed system and database information, which can potentially aid in further attacks.\n- **Increased Attack Surface:** The disclosed information can reveal potential vulnerabilities in the environment, increasing the attack surface for malicious actors.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited over the network.\n- **Direct HTTP Request:** A logged-in Pimcore user can navigate directly to the `/admin/index/statistics` endpoint using a web browser.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Pimcore User Credentials:** The attacker needs to have valid user credentials for the Pimcore system. Low privilege user accounts are sufficient to exploit the vulnerability.\n- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n- The vulnerability is present in versions <=1.5.1 of `pimcore/admin-ui-classic-bundle` and also in `pimcore/ee-admin-ui-classic-bundle` with the versions mentioned above.\n- The vulnerability is fixed in versions 1.5.2 (and corresponding versions of ee-admin-ui-classic-bundle)\n- The fix implemented an authorization check to ensure that only admin users or users with specific permission can access the `/admin/index/statistics` endpoint.\n\nThis is a clear information disclosure vulnerability due to missing authorization checks, allowing logged in users to access sensitive system information.",

A related weakness is CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information, because the **improper authorization** led to sensitive system data being exposed. CWE-285 is a class level CWE, and there may be more specific base level CWEs, but the evidence supports this class level CWE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe285 -->|CAN_LEAD_TO| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe285 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the **lack of proper authorization checks (CWE-285)** on the `/admin/index/statistics` endpoint. This **missing authorization** leads directly to the **exposure of sensitive information (CWE-200)**, including system details, PHP version, MySQL version, installed bundles, and database table information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified the core issue as a **missing** or **incorrect authorization** check leading to **sensitive information disclosure**. The provided evidence from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary strongly supports this conclusion: \"This was due to **missing proper authorization checks** before returning the statistics data.\" This statement directly points to CWE-285 Improper Authorization.\n\nThe selection of CWE-285 is based on the root cause provided in the evidence: a **failure** to properly authorize access to the `/admin/index/statistics` endpoint. The impact of this **failure** is the exposure of sensitive information (CWE-200).
