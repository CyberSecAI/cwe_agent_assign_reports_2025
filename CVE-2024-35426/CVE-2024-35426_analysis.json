This occurs when processing a crafted WebAssembly (wasm) file.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Code Execution:** Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution.\n- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The overflow can also cause a denial of service.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- The attack vector is a specially crafted WebAssembly (.wasm) file.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- The attacker needs the ability to provide the vulnerable application with a malicious WASM file.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe vulnerability stems from a stack buffer overflow within the `init_local_vars` function, triggered during the parsing of a malformed WASM file.  An attacker can leverage this to achieve remote code execution or cause a denial of service. The provided information is more detailed than the official CVE description placeholder, including specific function names, affected files, and the type of vulnerability.",

This relationship is hierarchical, with CWE-121 being a specific type of CWE-787. The vulnerability description clearly states \"stack overflow,\" making CWE-121 the more specific and appropriate choice. CWE-787 is included to represent the underlying mechanism.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe121[\"CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    \n    cwe121 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe121 primary\n    class cwe787 secondary\n    class cwe119 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **stack overflow** in the `init_local_vars` function, leading to an out-of-bounds write, which can then cause arbitrary code execution or denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-121 as the primary weakness due to the explicit mention of a \"stack overflow\" in the vulnerability description. This is supported by the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" which highlights \"**stack overflow**\" as a weakness. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" also indicates a \"stack buffer overflow\" in the `init_local_vars` function. The retriever results also list CWE-121 as the top combined result. While other CWEs like CWE-120 (Buffer Copy without Checking Size) and CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) were considered, CWE-121 is the most specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-193: Off-by-one Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product calculates or uses an incorrect maximum or minimum value that is 1 more, or 1 less, than the correct value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected*: There is no evidence of an off-by-one error in the description.\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected*: While this could be related, the root cause is explicitly a stack overflow, not necessarily an incorrect calculation of buffer size.
