The vulnerability is described in a PDF document found in a GitHub repository. The content also includes information about the Online Exam System project from kashipara.com, where the project was published.\n\nBased on the information provided, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n- The root cause is a broken access control issue in the Online Exam System. The specific nature of the broken access control is not detailed in this content but the title suggests it affects admin dashboard access and user deletion.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- Broken Access Control: Specifically, there's a lack of proper authorization mechanisms, allowing unauthorized access to the admin dashboard.\n- Unspecified User Deletion Issue:  The title indicates an issue related to user deletion, possibly allowing unauthorized users to delete accounts or manipulate user data.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- Unauthorized access to the admin dashboard, which could lead to:\n    - Manipulation of exam subjects and questions\n    - Viewing and modifying exam results\n    - Management (insert, delete, update) student data\n    - Sending fake notifications/emails to students.\n- User deletion, potentially causing:\n    - Data loss\n    - Disruption of service for legitimate users\n    - Manipulation of user accounts.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- Web Interface: The application is a web application, thus the attack vector is through the web interface\n- The exact method to bypass the access control is not specified.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- An attacker would need network access to the web application.\n-  The attacker might not need to be logged in to exploit the vulnerability, if the access control is completely broken, but may need to have some understanding of the applications structure.",

CWE-306 [CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function] is considered a secondary weakness because the vulnerability description mentions remote unauthenticated attackers, suggesting a lack of authentication as well. CWE-862 [CWE-862: Missing Authorization] is a child of CWE-284 [CWE-284: Improper Access Control], making it a more specific and preferred choice.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe306 secondary\n    class cwe284 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authorization** (CWE-862 [CWE-862: Missing Authorization]) and potentially **missing authentication** (CWE-306 [CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function]) for critical functions. This leads to unauthorized access to the administrator dashboard and the ability to delete valid user accounts.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis identifies the root cause as a **broken access control** issue, specifically **missing authorization**. The application **fails to check** if the user has sufficient privileges to access administrative functions. The evidence supporting this includes the ability for remote unauthenticated attackers to access administrator dashboard and delete user accounts via direct URL access.\n\nThe selection of CWE-862 [CWE-862: Missing Authorization] as the primary CWE is based on the vulnerability description stating that unauthenticated attackers can access administrative functionalities, indicating a lack of authorization checks. The inclusion of CWE-306 [CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function] is based on the fact that the attackers are unauthenticated, which suggests a missing authentication step. The retriever results and guidance on authentication vs authorization also support this decision.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
