## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content relates to a write-up on a Broken Access Control vulnerability in an Online Exam System. The vulnerability is described in a PDF document found in a GitHub repository. The content also includes information about the Online Exam System project from kashipara.com, where the project was published.

Based on the information provided, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a broken access control issue in the Online Exam System. The specific nature of the broken access control is not detailed in this content but the title suggests it affects admin dashboard access and user deletion.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Broken Access Control: Specifically, there's a lack of proper authorization mechanisms, allowing unauthorized access to the admin dashboard.
- Unspecified User Deletion Issue:  The title indicates an issue related to user deletion, possibly allowing unauthorized users to delete accounts or manipulate user data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthorized access to the admin dashboard, which could lead to:
    - Manipulation of exam subjects and questions
    - Viewing and modifying exam results
    - Management (insert, delete, update) student data
    - Sending fake notifications/emails to students.
- User deletion, potentially causing:
    - Data loss
    - Disruption of service for legitimate users
    - Manipulation of user accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Web Interface: The application is a web application, thus the attack vector is through the web interface
- The exact method to bypass the access control is not specified.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need network access to the web application.
-  The attacker might not need to be logged in to exploit the vulnerability, if the access control is completely broken, but may need to have some understanding of the applications structure.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control

**Authentication**:
Determines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.

* Example phrases: "user must log in", "lack of login check", "bypasses login"
* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.

  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* – used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).

**Authorization**:
Determines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do. It decides access *after* identity is verified.

* Example phrases: "unauthorized access", "regular user can access admin panel", "role checks are missing"
* CWE relevance: use CWEs like 862, 863, 285 for authorization errors:

  * **CWE-862**: *Missing Authorization* – the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all.
  * **CWE-863**: *Incorrect Authorization* – the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).
  * **CWE-285**: *Improper Authorization* – general category for any flawed authorization logic or design.

**Access Control**:
A broader term that includes both authentication and authorization. Governs how resources are protected and who can access them under what conditions.

* CWE relevance:

  * **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* – top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear.
  * This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.

## Mapping Discussion – Common Misclassification Patterns

### 1. **CWE-306 vs CWE-862**:

* **306** is about lack of **authentication** (e.g., *no login required at all*).
* **862** is about lack of **authorization** *after* authentication (e.g., *admin check missing*).
* ✅ Example CWE-306: *“An unauthenticated attacker can invoke the password reset API.”*
* ✅ Example CWE-862: *“An authenticated user without admin privileges can delete any user account.”*

### 2. **CWE-285 vs CWE-284**:

* **285** is specific to authorization flaws – it's a better choice than 284 **if** the issue involves *improper or missing role checks*.
* **284** should be reserved for general access control issues when it’s unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.

## Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification

**Phrase like "unauthorized access" is not enough.**

* If you **cannot determine whether identity was checked**, assume it’s **authorization** and consider 862 or 863.
* If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** → CWE-306.
* If the **access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced**, but it's not due to missing checks, consider **CWE-284**.

---

## Good Mapping Examples

* ✅ **CWE-306**: “The endpoint `/admin/deleteUser` does not require any authentication.”
* ✅ **CWE-862**: “Any logged-in user can change any other user's email without being an admin.”
* ✅ **CWE-863**: “An admin check exists but incorrectly grants access to non-admin users.”
* ✅ **CWE-285**: “Application uses a static role check that fails when roles change dynamically.”
* ✅ **CWE-284**: “Inconsistent enforcement of access rules across services with unclear policy source.”

## Summary – Quick LLM Rules of Thumb

| **Indicator**                                              | **Likely CWE** |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| No identity check (no login)                               | CWE-306        |
| No role/privilege check after login                        | CWE-862        |
| Role check is present but flawed                           | CWE-863        |
| General or ambiguous authorization failure                 | CWE-285        |
| High-level access control problem with no clear root cause | CWE-284        |
