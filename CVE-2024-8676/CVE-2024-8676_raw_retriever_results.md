# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-8676
## Query
A vulnerability was found in CRI-O, where it can be requested to take a checkpoint archive of a container and later be asked to restore it. When it does that restoration, it attempts to restore the mounts from the restore archive instead of the pod request. As a result, the validations run on the pod spec, verifying that the pod has access to the mounts it specifies are not applicable to a restored container. This flaw allows a malicious user to trick CRI-O into restoring a pod that doesnt have access to host mounts. The user needs access to the kubelet or cri-o socket to call the restore endpoint and trigger the restore.
