## Vulnerability Description
When the assert() function in the GNU C Library versions 2.13 to 2.40 fails, it **does not allocate enough space** for the assertion failure message string and size information, which may lead to a **buffer overflow** if the message string size aligns to page size.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **does not allocate enough space**
- **weakness:** **buffer overflow**
- **product:** GNU C Library
- **version:** 2.13 to 2.40
- **component:** assert() function

CVE-2025-0395: Buffer overflow in the GNU C Library's assert()

Root cause of vulnerability:
- The assert() function in the GNU C Library does not allocate enough space for the assertion failure message string and size information, leading to a buffer overflow when the message string size aligns to the page size.
- Specifically, an unsigned int (size) is written into the mmaped buffer in addition to the string, causing an overflow when strcpy() is called.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Buffer overflow in assert() function.
- Insufficient buffer allocation for assertion failure message.
- Use of strcpy() without proper bounds checking.

Impact of exploitation:
- Potential for local exploitation if a SUID program exists with a reachable assertion failure.
- Possible metadata corruption in the heap, potentially leading to further exploitation.

Attack vectors:
- Local attacker controlling the __progname (basename of argv[0]) can influence the padding and trigger the overflow.
- Triggering an assertion failure in a SUID program.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Local access to the system.
- Ability to trigger an assertion failure in a program (potentially a SUID program).
- Control over the program name (__progname).

Mitigation or fix:
- The vulnerability has been patched in glibc versions 2.40-66 and 2.41.
- The fix involves allocating sufficient space for the assertion failure message and its size information.

Additional details (more than official CVE description):
- The overflow occurs in the __assert_fail_base() function.
- The vulnerability is mmap-based.
- The overflow is at most an off-by-four bytes.
- The attacker does not control the four bytes that overflow the buffer.
- __libc_message_impl() in sysdeps/posix/libc_fatal.c is also vulnerable to a similar buffer overflow, but is less exploitable in practice.
- The vulnerability can be triggered in both SUID and non-SUID programs.
- The exploitability depends on the memory layout and ASLR.
- The vulnerability can manifest as a segmentation fault or an abort.
