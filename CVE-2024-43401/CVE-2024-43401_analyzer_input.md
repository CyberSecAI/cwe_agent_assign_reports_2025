# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-43401

## Vulnerability Description
XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. A user without script/programming right can trick a user with elevated rights to edit a content with a malicious payload using a WYSIWYG editor. The user with elevated rights is not warned beforehand that they are going to edit possibly dangerous content. The payload is executed at edit time. This vulnerability has been patched in XWiki 15.10RC1.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** execute payload
- **vector:** malicious payload
- **attacker:** user without script/programming right
- **product:** XWiki Platform
- **version:** prior to 15.10RC1
- **component:** WYSIWYG editor

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-43401:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization and security checks when handling user-provided content within WYSIWYG editors. Specifically, script/programming code (like Groovy or Velocity) could be embedded within comments, user profiles or other editable fields.
- When a user with script/programming rights (like an admin) edits these fields, the embedded code is executed, leading to potential remote code execution. The core issue is that the system does not analyze the content being edited to assess required rights and warn the user if they are going to edit dangerous content.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Improper Input Handling:** The application allows users to input potentially malicious code into various content fields (e.g., comments, user profiles) through WYSIWYG editors.
- **Missing Contextual Security Checks:** The system fails to perform required rights analysis of the content before an admin/elevated user edits and loads it in the WYSIWYG editor which leads to the execution of scripts. The user is not informed that they are editing potentially dangerous content.
- **Privilege Escalation:** A user without script/programming rights can inject malicious code that is then executed with the privileges of the user editing the content.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution on the server by embedding malicious scripts within user-editable content.
- **Full system compromise:**  The attacker can potentially gain complete control of the server, leading to data breaches, data manipulation, service disruption, and other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- **User-Provided Content:** Attackers can inject malicious code through text fields in comments, user profiles, or other editable areas.
- **WYSIWYG Editors:** The execution of the malicious code occurs when a user with sufficient privileges edits the content via WYSIWYG editors.
- **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, as it involves a client (user's browser) interacting with a server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Access to an XWiki instance:** The attacker needs an account on an XWiki instance and ability to create/edit comments, user profiles or other editable content.
- **Ability to inject code:**  The attacker needs the ability to insert malicious script/programming code into fields using a WYSIWYG editor
- **Victim with script/programming rights:** The attacker must trick a user with script/programming rights into editing the malicious payload for the exploit to occur.

**Additional Notes:**
- The issue was reported on Intigriti by user `floerer`.
- This vulnerability is addressed by introducing a new required rights analyzer to detect potentially dangerous content before it is edited by a user with elevated privileges.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 15.10-rc-1.
- Several related Jira tickets address the underlying security problem, such as the need to analyze required rights for various macros (HTML, raw, cache, context etc) and document classes and to warn users if they are going to edit potentially dangerous content.
