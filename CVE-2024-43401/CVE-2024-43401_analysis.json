  "description": "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. A user without script/programming right can trick a user with elevated rights to edit a content with a malicious payload using a WYSIWYG editor. The user with elevated rights is not warned beforehand that they are going to edit possibly dangerous content. The payload is executed at edit time. This vulnerability has been patched in XWiki 15.10RC1.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-43401:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n- The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization and security checks when handling user-provided content within WYSIWYG editors. Specifically, script/programming code (like Groovy or Velocity) could be embedded within comments, user profiles or other editable fields.\n- When a user with script/programming rights (like an admin) edits these fields, the embedded code is executed, leading to potential remote code execution. The core issue is that the system does not analyze the content being edited to assess required rights and warn the user if they are going to edit dangerous content.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- **Improper Input Handling:** The application allows users to input potentially malicious code into various content fields (e.g., comments, user profiles) through WYSIWYG editors.\n- **Missing Contextual Security Checks:** The system fails to perform required rights analysis of the content before an admin/elevated user edits and loads it in the WYSIWYG editor which leads to the execution of scripts. The user is not informed that they are editing potentially dangerous content.\n- **Privilege Escalation:** A user without script/programming rights can inject malicious code that is then executed with the privileges of the user editing the content.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution on the server by embedding malicious scripts within user-editable content.\n- **Full system compromise:**  The attacker can potentially gain complete control of the server, leading to data breaches, data manipulation, service disruption, and other malicious activities.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- **User-Provided Content:** Attackers can inject malicious code through text fields in comments, user profiles, or other editable areas.\n- **WYSIWYG Editors:** The execution of the malicious code occurs when a user with sufficient privileges edits the content via WYSIWYG editors.\n- **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, as it involves a client (user's browser) interacting with a server.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- **Access to an XWiki instance:** The attacker needs an account on an XWiki instance and ability to create/edit comments, user profiles or other editable content.\n- **Ability to inject code:**  The attacker needs the ability to insert malicious script/programming code into fields using a WYSIWYG editor\n- **Victim with script/programming rights:** The attacker must trick a user with script/programming rights into editing the malicious payload for the exploit to occur.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The issue was reported on Intigriti by user `floerer`.\n- This vulnerability is addressed by introducing a new required rights analyzer to detect potentially dangerous content before it is edited by a user with elevated privileges.\n- The vulnerability was fixed in version 15.10-rc-1.\n- Several related Jira tickets address the underlying security problem, such as the need to analyze required rights for various macros (HTML, raw, cache, context etc) and document classes and to warn users if they are going to edit potentially dangerous content.\n\nThe provided information goes into much greater detail than the placeholder CVE description, outlining the attack vector, the underlying code execution vulnerability, and the various steps taken to address it.",

This leads to **improper control of code generation**, allowing a malicious payload to be injected. When a user with elevated privileges edits the content, the payload is executed, resulting in remote code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, particularly the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section. The root cause of the vulnerability is the **lack of proper sanitization** and security checks when handling user-provided content within WYSIWYG editors, leading to the execution of arbitrary code.\n\nThe primary CWE is CWE-94, as it directly addresses the **improper control of code generation** due to the **lack of neutralization of special elements** in the input. The other CWEs considered were related to input validation and output encoding, but CWE-94 best captures the root cause of the vulnerability.\n\nThe selection of CWE-94 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it is a Base CWE that accurately represents the weakness. While there are more specific child CWEs of CWE-94 (e.g., CWE-95, CWE-96, CWE-1336), the provided evidence does not support mapping to those more specific CWEs, but to the general case of **improper control of code generation**.\n\nThe vulnerability description mentions that a user without script/programming rights can trick a user with elevated rights to edit content with a malicious payload. This suggests that **external control of parameters** can influence the behavior of the application. This aligns with CWE-472, which describes the external control of assumed-immutable web parameters.\n\nThe description also highlights the injection of malicious code through text fields in comments and user profiles. This indicates that the application does not properly neutralize input during web page generation, potentially leading to cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. This aligns with CWE-79.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
