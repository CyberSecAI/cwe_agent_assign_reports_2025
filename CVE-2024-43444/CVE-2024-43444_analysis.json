This occurs when specific configurations related to authentication sources are combined with enabled debugging for the authentication backend.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n-   CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File. The vulnerability lies in logging sensitive password data in plain text.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n-   CAPEC-545: Pull Data from System Resources. An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to user passwords by accessing the admin logs if the system is configured with vulnerable settings and debugging enabled. This could lead to unauthorized account access and further compromise of the system or data.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- An attacker with access to the OTRS system's admin log module (either through direct access, or potentially through exploiting other vulnerabilities) could retrieve the plaintext passwords.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- The attacker needs to have access to the OTRS system's admin log module. This could mean having administrative credentials or exploiting other vulnerabilities to gain access.\n- The vulnerability is present only when specific authentication configurations are used in combination with debugging being enabled for the authentication backend.\n\n**Affected Products:**\n-   OTRS: Versions 7.0.x through 7.0.50, 8.0.x, 2023.x, and 2024.x through 2024.5.x.\n-   ((OTRS)) Community Edition: Version 6.0.x and products based on it.\n\n**Solution:**\n- Update to OTRS 2024.6.1 or OTRS 7.0.51.\n\n**CVSS Score:**\n- CVSS v3.1: 8.2 HIGH\n- CVSS v4.0: 8.6 HIGH\n- CVSS v3.1 Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N\n- CVSS v4.0 Vector: CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:P/VC:H/VI:H/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/R:A/V:D/RE:L/U:Amber",

CWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password) and CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) were also considered. CWE-532 is a child of CWE-200, but it is more specific and fits the vulnerability better.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe532[\"CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File\"]\n    cwe256[\"CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe532 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe532 primary\n    class cwe256,cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **incorrect** configuration of the authentication backend and enabling debugging. This leads to the **insertion of sensitive information (passwords) into the log file (CWE-532)**, which then results in the exposure of this sensitive information. If someone gains access to the logs, it leads to **exposure of sensitive information to unauthorized actors (CWE-200)**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is CWE-532 because the **root cause** is the **insertion of the passwords in plain text into the log files**.\nThe evidence for this is:\n- Passwords of agents and customers are written in plain text to the OTRS admin log module.\n- CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File. The vulnerability lies in logging sensitive password data in plain text.\nCWE-256 was considered because the passwords are being stored in plain text in the logs.\nCWE-200 was considered because the plain text passwords are now accessible to unauthorized actors if they have access to the logs.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as
