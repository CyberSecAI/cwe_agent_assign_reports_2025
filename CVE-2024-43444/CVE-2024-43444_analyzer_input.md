# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-43444

## Vulnerability Description
Passwords of agents and customers are displayed in plain text in the OTRS admin log module if certain configurations regarding the authentication sources match and debugging for the authentication backend has been enabled. This issue affects * OTRS from 7.0.X through 7.0.50 * OTRS 8.0.X * OTRS 2023.X * OTRS from 2024.X through 2024.5.X * ((OTRS)) Community Edition 6.0.x Products based on the ((OTRS)) Community Edition also very likely to be affected

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** display passwords in plain text
- **product:** OTRS
- **version:** 7.0.X through 7.0.50 and 8.0.X and 2023.X and 2024.X through 2024.5.X and Community Edition 6.0.x
- **component:** admin log module

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content is a security advisory for OTRS, and it includes details about CVE-2024-43444.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Passwords of agents and customers are written in plain text to the OTRS admin log module. This occurs when specific configurations related to authentication sources are combined with enabled debugging for the authentication backend.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-   CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File. The vulnerability lies in logging sensitive password data in plain text.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   CAPEC-545: Pull Data from System Resources. An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to user passwords by accessing the admin logs if the system is configured with vulnerable settings and debugging enabled. This could lead to unauthorized account access and further compromise of the system or data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker with access to the OTRS system's admin log module (either through direct access, or potentially through exploiting other vulnerabilities) could retrieve the plaintext passwords.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have access to the OTRS system's admin log module. This could mean having administrative credentials or exploiting other vulnerabilities to gain access.
- The vulnerability is present only when specific authentication configurations are used in combination with debugging being enabled for the authentication backend.

**Affected Products:**
-   OTRS: Versions 7.0.x through 7.0.50, 8.0.x, 2023.x, and 2024.x through 2024.5.x.
-   ((OTRS)) Community Edition: Version 6.0.x and products based on it.

**Solution:**
- Update to OTRS 2024.6.1 or OTRS 7.0.51.

**CVSS Score:**
- CVSS v3.1: 8.2 HIGH
- CVSS v4.0: 8.6 HIGH
- CVSS v3.1 Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N
- CVSS v4.0 Vector: CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:P/VC:H/VI:H/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/R:A/V:D/RE:L/U:Amber

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control

**Authentication**:
Determines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.

* Example phrases: "user must log in", "lack of login check", "bypasses login"
* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.

  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* – used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).

**Authorization**:
Determines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do. It decides access *after* identity is verified.

* Example phrases: "unauthorized access", "regular user can access admin panel", "role checks are missing"
* CWE relevance: use CWEs like 862, 863, 285 for authorization errors:

  * **CWE-862**: *Missing Authorization* – the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all.
  * **CWE-863**: *Incorrect Authorization* – the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).
  * **CWE-285**: *Improper Authorization* – general category for any flawed authorization logic or design.

**Access Control**:
A broader term that includes both authentication and authorization. Governs how resources are protected and who can access them under what conditions.

* CWE relevance:

  * **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* – top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear.
  * This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.

## Mapping Discussion – Common Misclassification Patterns

### 1. **CWE-306 vs CWE-862**:

* **306** is about lack of **authentication** (e.g., *no login required at all*).
* **862** is about lack of **authorization** *after* authentication (e.g., *admin check missing*).
* ✅ Example CWE-306: *“An unauthenticated attacker can invoke the password reset API.”*
* ✅ Example CWE-862: *“An authenticated user without admin privileges can delete any user account.”*

### 2. **CWE-285 vs CWE-284**:

* **285** is specific to authorization flaws – it's a better choice than 284 **if** the issue involves *improper or missing role checks*.
* **284** should be reserved for general access control issues when it’s unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.

---

## Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification

**Phrase like "unauthorized access" is not enough.**

* If you **cannot determine whether identity was checked**, assume it’s **authorization** and consider 862 or 863.
* If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** → CWE-306.
* If the **access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced**, but it's not due to missing checks, consider **CWE-284**.

---

## Good Mapping Examples

* ✅ **CWE-306**: “The endpoint `/admin/deleteUser` does not require any authentication.”
* ✅ **CWE-862**: “Any logged-in user can change any other user's email without being an admin.”
* ✅ **CWE-863**: “An admin check exists but incorrectly grants access to non-admin users.”
* ✅ **CWE-285**: “Application uses a static role check that fails when roles change dynamically.”
* ✅ **CWE-284**: “Inconsistent enforcement of access rules across services with unclear policy source.”

| ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| No identity check (no login)                               | CWE-306        |
| No role/privilege check after login                        | CWE-862        |
| Role check is present but flawed                           | CWE-863        |
| General or ambiguous authorization failure                 | CWE-285        |
| High-level access control problem with no clear root cause | CWE-284        |
