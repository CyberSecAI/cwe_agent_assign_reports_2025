  "description": "A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, has been found in Tenda AC6 15.03.05.16. Affected by this issue is some unknown functionality of the file /goform/WifiExtraSet. The manipulation of the argument wpapsk_crypto leads to **stack-based buffer overflow**. The attack may be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.",

CWE-121 is a specific type of buffer overflow that occurs on the stack.

The most specific and accurate CWE for this vulnerability is CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow). The retriever results also list CWE-121 as a candidate.

Because the description explicitly mentions \"stack-based,\" CWE-121 is the better choice.\n\nOther CWEs, such as those related to integer overflows, SQL injection, and cross-site scripting, were considered but deemed irrelevant because they do not align with the specific nature of a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability.\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA stack-based buffer overflow condition is a condition where the buffer being overwritten is allocated on the stack (i.e., is a local variable or, rarely, a parameter to a function).\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: alternate_terms\n\n**Description**:\nThe software performs an operation that attempts to read or write data past the boundaries of the associated buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Class level of abstraction, which is less preferred than more specific Base or Variant levels.\n\n## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: alternate_terms\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs a calculation that can produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than the original value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.",
