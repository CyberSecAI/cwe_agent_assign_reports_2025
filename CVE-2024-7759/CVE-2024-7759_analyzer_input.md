# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-7759

## Vulnerability Description
The PWA for WP WordPress plugin before 1.7.72 **does not sanitise and escape some of its settings**, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored **Cross-Site Scripting** attacks even when the unfiltered_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2024-7759 Content

The provided content is **RELEVANT** to CVE-2024-7759. It details a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the PWA for WP & AMP plugin. Here's a breakdown of the information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
*   Insufficient input validation/sanitization

**Impact of exploitation:**

An attacker with Administrator+ privileges can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' browsers when they view the affected settings page.

**Attack vectors:**

*   An attacker modifies the `pwaforwp_settings[normal_enable]` parameter with a malicious script payload.
*   The payload is saved through the plugin's settings page.
*   When other users (with sufficient privileges) load the settings page, the script executes.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   Authenticated user with Administrator+ privileges.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.7.72 of the plugin.

**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**

*   **Proof of Concept:** Detailed steps are provided to reproduce the vulnerability.
*   **CVSS Score:** 3.5 (Low)
*   **References:** Links to the CVE entry (CVE-2024-7759), a YouTube video (presumably demonstrating the exploit), and the WP vulnerability database entry.
*   **Researcher:** Krugov Artyom is credited with discovering the vulnerability.
*   **Timeline:** Dates for public disclosure, addition to the database, and last update are provided.
*   **OWASP/CWE Mapping:** The vulnerability is mapped to OWASP Top 10 (A7: Cross-Site Scripting) and CWE-79.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* 🔍 *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* 🔍 *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion – CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### 🔸 CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ✅ *“A user created with the ‘guest’ role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ✅ *“The backup service runs as root but only needs read access.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ⚠️ This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### 🔸 CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ✅ *“User can access another user’s invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.”*

## Mapping Examples – Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *“User can escalate privileges to admin.”*
> ❌ Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged – only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ✅ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**

| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| “Escalate to root/admin”                    | Privilege escalation impact           | Not CWE-269! Use root cause (e.g., 266, 250) |
| “Assigned wrong role/group”                 | Misassigned privilege                 | CWE-266                                      |
| “Runs as root” or “Should not run as admin” | Over-privileged execution             | CWE-250                                      |
| “Unauthorized read/write to file”           | Permission control issue              | CWE-285                                      |
| “Can access resource without correct role”  | Incorrect or missing permission check | CWE-285, 862, 863                            |

## Good Mapping Examples – Privileges & Permissions

* ✅ **CWE-266**: *“When a new user registers, the system assigns them admin role due to a missing role validation.”*
* ✅ **CWE-250**: *“Installer runs with system-level privileges but doesn't require them to install files in the user directory.”*
* ✅ **CWE-284**: *“Inconsistent access rules between UI and backend for sensitive endpoints.”*
* ✅ **CWE-285**: *“Authorization logic fails to restrict access to finance reports based on department.”*
