## Vulnerability Description
IrfanView DXF File Parsing Memory Corruption Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of IrfanView. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of DXF files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a **memory corruption** condition. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-24598.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the improper validation of user-supplied data when parsing DXF files in IrfanView, leading to a memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Memory Corruption:** Lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during DXF file parsing. This can lead to memory corruption due to an invalid memory access when processing the malicious DXF file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process (i.e., the IrfanView application).

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious File:** The user must open a specially crafted, malicious DXF file.
*   **Malicious Page:** The user must visit a malicious page, presumably that would initiate the processing of the malicious DXF file, likely using the Irfanview application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to deliver the malicious DXF file to the victim, or convince the victim to visit a malicious page.
*   No special privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability. The user interaction (opening the file or visiting the page) is sufficient.

**Additional details:**
* The vulnerability is fixed in IrfanView version 4.70 with plugins version 4.70.
*  The CVSS score is 7.8, with the vector: AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H, which translates to:
    *   **AV:L (Attack Vector: Local):** The attacker needs to be able to deliver the exploit file to the victim's local system or have some access that would allow triggering local file handling by IrfanView.
    *   **AC:L (Attack Complexity: Low):** The attack is easily achieved.
    *   **PR:N (Privileges Required: None):** No special privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability.
    *   **UI:R (User Interaction: Required):** User interaction is needed to exploit the vulnerability (opening a malicious file or visiting malicious web page).
    *   **S:U (Scope: Unchanged):** An exploited vulnerability impacts only the vulnerable component.
    *   **C:H (Confidentiality: High):** There is a high impact on the confidentiality of the system.
    *   **I:H (Integrity: High):** There is a high impact on the integrity of the system.
    *   **A:H (Availability: High):** There is a high impact on the availability of the system.
