# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-2914

## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability classified as problematic has been found in HDF5 up to 1.14.6. This affects the function H5FS__sinfo_Srialize_Sct_cb of the file src/H5FScache.c. The manipulation of the argument sect leads to **heap-based buffer overflow**. Local access is required to approach this attack. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **heap-based buffer overflow**
- **vector:** manipulation of sect argument
- **product:** HDF5
- **version:** up to 1.14.6
- **component:** function H5FS__sinfo_Srialize_Sct_cb in src/H5FScache.c

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-2914 Content

Based on the provided content, this relates to a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the HDF5 library. Here's a breakdown of the information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a missing boundary check in the `H5FS__sinfo_serialize_sect_cb` function (located in `src/H5FScache.c` at line 1390). Specifically, the `UINT64ENCODE_VAR` macro is called without verifying if sufficient buffer space is available, leading to a write beyond the allocated memory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow:** The core vulnerability is a heap buffer overflow.
*   **Missing Boundary Check:** The lack of input validation before writing to the buffer is the direct cause.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Application Crash:** The overflow can lead to an application crash.
*   **Potential for further exploitation:** While not explicitly stated, a heap buffer overflow can potentially be exploited for more severe consequences, such as arbitrary code execution, depending on the surrounding memory layout and application context.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Processing specially crafted HDF5 files:** The PoC demonstrates triggering the vulnerability by processing a specific HDF5 file created by the fuzzer.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Ability to create/provide malicious HDF5 files:** An attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted HDF5 file to a vulnerable application.
*   **No specific privileges required:** The PoC doesn't indicate any specific privilege requirements to trigger the vulnerability.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   The issue requires a fix in the HDF5 library to include proper boundary checks before calling `UINT64ENCODE_VAR` within the `H5FS__sinfo_serialize_sect_cb` function. The issue is marked as a "Blocker" for the 2.0.0 release, indicating a fix is required before release.

**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**

*   **Affected Version:** hdf5 v1.14.6
*   **Detailed Code Snippet:** The content provides the vulnerable code snippet from `H5FS__sinfo_serialize_sect_cb` and the expanded `UINT64ENCODE_VAR` macro.
*   **PoC:** A proof-of-concept (PoC) is included, along with instructions for building and running it using AddressSanitizer to confirm the vulnerability.
*   **AddressSanitizer Report:** The AddressSanitizer report provides specific details about the memory corruption, including the address of the overflow and the call stack.
*   **Build Instructions:** Detailed build instructions using clang and sanitizers are provided.
*   **Issue Tracking:** The issue is tracked on GitHub ([https://github.com/HDFGroup/hdf5/issues/5379](https://github.com/HDFGroup/hdf5/issues/5379)).
