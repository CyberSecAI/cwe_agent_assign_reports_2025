# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-13533

## Vulnerability Description
The Small Package Quotes USPS Edition plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the edit_id parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.5 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**.
