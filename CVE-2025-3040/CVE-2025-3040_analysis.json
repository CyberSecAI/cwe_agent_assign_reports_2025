  "description": "A vulnerability was found in Project Worlds Online Time Table Generator 1.0. It has been rated as critical. Affected by this issue is some unknown functionality of the file /admin/add_student.php. The manipulation of the argument pic leads to **unrestricted upload**. The attack may be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.",

Attackers can upload malicious scripts (php) due to missing file type checks and extension filtering.\n\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities present:\n* CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\n* Remote Code Execution via Unrestricted File Upload\n\nImpact of exploitation:\n* Malware Distribution\n* Remote Code Execution (RCE)\n* Data Breach\n* Denial of Service (DoS)\n* Web Shell Installation\n* Bypassing Security Controls\n* Reputation Damage\n\nAttack vectors:\n* By crafting a malicious file (e.g., \"shell.php\") and submitting it via the upload form, attackers can bypass security controls.\n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position:\n* Attacker needs to be able to upload files to the \"/admin/add_student.php\" file upload module.\n\nMitigation or fix:\n* Input Validation & Filtering: Ensure parameter allows only expected characters (e.g., digits or letters) to prevent path traversal attacks.\n* Filename Sanitization: Strictly validate uploaded filenames. Avoid using user-provided original names and restrict allowed file extensions.\n* Randomized Storage Names: Generate randomized filenames to prevent attackers from directly accessing malicious files.\n* File Type Verification: Validate both file extensions and MIME types to detect spoofed formats.\n* Storage Directory Permissions: Store uploaded files in a non-web-accessible directory or configure the server to disable script execution.\n* Server Configuration: For Apache/Nginx, restrict execution permissions in upload directories (e.g., `php_flag engine off`).\n* Error Handling: Avoid exposing internal path details by using custom error pages.\n```",

No other parent, child, or peer relationships were deemed relevant as CWE-434 directly addresses the **unrestricted upload** issue. There are no chain relationships. The base level abstraction is optimal as it directly reflects the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe434[\"CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\"]\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe434 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **unrestricted upload** (**CWE-434**), which allows an attacker to upload malicious files. This can lead to remote code execution on the server if the uploaded file is processed.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and the content summary from the CVE reference links. The key phrase \"unrestricted upload\" from the Vulnerability Description Key Phrases and the explicit mention of \"CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\" in the CVE Reference Links Content Summary provide direct evidence for mapping this vulnerability to **CWE-434 (Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type)**. The root cause is the **lack of proper validation** of user-supplied files in the `/admin/add_student.php` file upload functionality. The abstraction level of Base is the most appropriate as it directly represents the weakness.\n\nCWEs considered but not used:\n\n*   CWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')): While SQL injection could be a potential risk in web applications, the primary vulnerability described focuses on file upload, not SQL command construction.\n*   CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')): Similar to SQL injection, XSS is a different type of vulnerability than the one described.\n*   CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function): Although authentication issues could be present, the core vulnerability is the **unrestricted file upload**, making CWE-434 the more direct and accurate mapping.\n* CWE-472 (External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter): This is about manipulating parameters that are assumed to be immutable, but the core vulnerability is the **unrestricted file upload**.\n\nThe decision to map to CWE-434 is strongly supported by the evidence, aligning with the principle of selecting the most specific and relevant CWE.",
