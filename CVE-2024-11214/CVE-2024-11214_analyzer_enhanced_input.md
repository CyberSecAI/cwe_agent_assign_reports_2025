- **product:** Best Employee Management System
- **version:** 1
- **component:** /admin/profile.php

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the lack of proper validation and sanitization of uploaded files in the `/admin/profile.php` file of the "Employee management system" application. Specifically, the code does not restrict file types or validate file content.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unrestricted File Upload:** The application allows users to upload files without checking their type or content.
- **Lack of Sanitization:** The uploaded file names are not sanitized or randomized, which can potentially lead to overwrite issues.
- **Direct File Execution:** Uploaded files are placed in a directory where they can be directly accessed and executed by the webserver.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading a malicious PHP file (e.g., `shell.php`) and accessing it through the web browser, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.
- **System Compromise:** The attacker can gain full control over the server, potentially leading to data theft, malware installation, or denial-of-service attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File Upload Form:** The attacker uploads a malicious file through the profile update functionality in the `/admin/profile.php` page.
- **Direct URL Access:** After successful upload, the attacker accesses the malicious script directly through a URL in the `/assets/uploadImage/Profile/` directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker must have a valid user account with the necessary privileges to access the profile settings where the vulnerable upload functionality resides.
- **Web Browser:** The attacker needs a web browser to interact with the application and send malicious requests.
- **Network Access:**  The attacker needs network access to the web application.

**Technical Details:**

*   **Vulnerable Code Snippet:**

    ```php
    $target_dir = "../assets/uploadImage/Profile/";
    $website_logo = basename($_FILES["website_image"]["name"]);
    if($_FILES["website_image"]["tmp_name"]!=''){
        $image = $target_dir . basename($_FILES["website_image"]["name"]);
        if (move_uploaded_file($_FILES["website_image"]["tmp_name"], $image)) {
            @unlink("../assets/uploadImage/Profile/".$_POST['old_website_image']);
        } else {
            echo "Sorry, there was an error uploading your file.";
        }
    } else {
        $website_logo =$_POST['old_website_image'];
    }
    ```
*   **PoC (Proof of Concept):**
    1.  Create a malicious PHP file (e.g., `shell.php`) containing: `<?php system($_GET['cmd']);?>`
    2.  Upload the malicious file using the profile picture upload functionality.
    3.  Access the uploaded file via a URL like: `http://localhost/hr_soft/assets/uploadImage/Profile/malicious.php?cmd=ipconfig`.
*   The provided screenshots illustrate the steps of a successful exploitation and the resulting execution of commands on the server.
**Mitigation Recommendations:**
- Implement server-side checks to allow only specific image file types (e.g., .jpg, .png). Example code provided:
```php
$allowed_types = array("image/jpeg", "image/png");
if (!in_array($_FILES["website_image"]["type"], $allowed_types)) {
    die("Only JPG and PNG files are allowed.");
}
```
- Rename uploaded files using random or unique names.
- Store uploads in a directory that does not allow execution of php files.
- Configure the server to disable PHP execution in the upload directory using `.htaccess`.
