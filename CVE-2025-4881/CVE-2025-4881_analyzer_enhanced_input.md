## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The content relates to CVE-2025-4881. Here's the extracted information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

* A SQL injection vulnerability was found in the '/admin/user\_save.php' file of the 'Restaurant Management System System' project. The reason for this issue is that attackers inject malicious code from the parameter 'username' and use it directly in SQL queries without the need for appropriate cleaning or validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

* SQL injection

**Impact of exploitation:**

* Attackers can exploit this SQL injection vulnerability to achieve unauthorized database access, sensitive data leakage, data tampering, comprehensive system control, and even service interruption.

**Attack vectors:**

* The '/admin/user\_save.php' file is vulnerable.
* The 'username' parameter is the entry point for the attack.
* No login or authorization is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*  An attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the `/admin/user_save.php` endpoint. No authentication is required.

**Mitigation or fix:**

* Use prepared statements and parameter binding.
* Input validation and filtering.
* Minimize database user permissions.
* Regular security audits.

**Payload examples:**

*   **boolean-based blind:** `name=1&username=1' RLIKE (SELECT (CASE WHEN (7161=7161) THEN 1 ELSE 0x28 END)) AND 'Astp'='Astp&password=1`
*   **time-based blind:** `name=1&username=1' AND (SELECT 3024 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))JbhY) AND 'tyTh'='tyTh&password=1`
*   **name parameter (boolean-based blind):** `name=1' RLIKE (SELECT (CASE WHEN (2307=2307) THEN 1 ELSE 0x28 END)) AND 'nBzn'='nBzn&username=1&password=1`
*   **name parameter (time-based blind):** `name=1' AND (SELECT 8897 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))Eyzy) AND 'DkUd'='DkUd&username=1&password=1`
