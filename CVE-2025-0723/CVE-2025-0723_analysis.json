  "description": "The ProfileGrid User Profiles, Groups and Communities plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to blind and time-based SQL Injections via the rid and search parameters in all versions up to, and including, 5.9.4.7 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**.

  "reference_content": "The provided content is source code for a WordPress plugin named \"ProfileGrid - User Profiles, Groups, and Communities,\" specifically the `class-profile-magic-chat-system.php` file. It implements a messaging system within the plugin.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe code does not appear to have any immediately obvious vulnerabilities. However, the code lacks sufficient input sanitization and validation, particularly in the `pm_messenger_search_threads` and `pm_messenger_show_messages` functions, which could lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n*   **Potential SQL Injection:** The `pm_messenger_search_threads` function uses user-supplied `$search` input directly in a SQL query without proper sanitization: `$additional = \"content LIKE '%\" . $search . \"%'\"`\n*   **Potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The code uses `wp_kses` for output, but it's not consistently applied to all user-supplied data before rendering it in HTML.  For example, user display names are output using `echo wp_strip_all_tags($pmrequests->pm_get_display_name($rid, false));` which may not be sufficient.\n*   **Lack of Access Control:** The code doesn't appear to have robust checks to ensure users can only access and modify their own messages.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n*   **SQL Injection:** An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries, leading to data breaches, modification, or deletion.\n*   **XSS:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the messages, which could be executed in the browsers of other users, leading to account takeover or other malicious activities.\n*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker might be able to read or modify messages belonging to other users.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n*   **Search Function:** An attacker could craft a malicious search query in the messaging search box to inject SQL code.\n*   **Message Content:** An attacker could include malicious JavaScript code in the content of a message.\n*   **User Profile Manipulation:** If user profile data is not properly sanitized, an attacker could inject malicious code into a user's profile, which could then be displayed to other users.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n*   **Authenticated User:**  Most of the attacks require an attacker to be a logged-in user of the WordPress site.\n*   **Basic Web Application Knowledge:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL injection and XSS vulnerabilities.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n*   **SQL Injection:** Use prepared statements with parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.  Never directly concatenate user input into SQL queries.\n*   **XSS:**  Consistently use `wp_kses` with a strict allowed HTML tag list to sanitize all user-supplied data before rendering it in HTML.  Consider using escaping functions like `esc_html()` and `esc_attr()` as appropriate.\n*   **Access Control:** Implement robust access control checks to ensure that users can only access and modify their own messages.\n*   **Input Validation:** Validate all user input to ensure it conforms to expected formats and lengths.\n*   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of the code to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.\n\nThe content provides more detail than the official CVE description, as it is the actual source code.",
