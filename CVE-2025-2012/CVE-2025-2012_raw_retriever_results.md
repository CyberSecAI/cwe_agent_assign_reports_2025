Ashlar-Vellum Cobalt VS File Parsing Out-Of-Bounds Read Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Ashlar-Vellum Cobalt. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of VS files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-25185.

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: 'lack of proper validation of user-supplied data'
- **weakness**: 'Out-Of-Bounds Read', 'read past the end of an allocated buffer'
