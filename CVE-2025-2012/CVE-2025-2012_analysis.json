  "description": "Ashlar-Vellum Cobalt VS File Parsing Out-Of-Bounds Read Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Ashlar-Vellum Cobalt. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of VS files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-25185.",

This leads to **CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read)**, where the program reads data past the end of an allocated buffer. The impact is the ability to execute arbitrary code on affected installations.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is primarily based on the vulnerability description, which explicitly states \"**lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer.\" The **root cause** is the **lack of proper validation**, but the **weakness** is the **Out-Of-Bounds Read**. The retriever results also support this analysis, with **CWE-125** being a top candidate. **CWE-20** is considered as a contributing factor but is less specific than **CWE-125**.\n\nI considered CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write), CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow), and CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound), but these were not selected because the description specifically mentions a read operation rather than a write or overflow.
