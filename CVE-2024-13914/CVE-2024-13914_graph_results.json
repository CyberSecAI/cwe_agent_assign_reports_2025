  "query": "The File Manager Advanced Shortcode WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 2.5.4 (file-manager-advanced-shortcode) and 2.5.6 (advanced-file-manager-pro-premium), via the file_manager_advanced shortcode. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to include and execute arbitrary JavaScript files on the server. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where images and other safe file types can be uploaded and included. Sites currently using 2.5.4 (file-manager-advanced-shortcode) should be updated to 2.6.0 (advanced-file-manager-pro-premium).",
