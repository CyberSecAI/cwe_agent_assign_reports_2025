  "description": "The File Manager Advanced Shortcode WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to **Local File Inclusion** in all versions up to, and including, 2.5.4 (file-manager-advanced-shortcode) and 2.5.6 (advanced-file-manager-pro-premium), via the file_manager_advanced shortcode. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to include and execute arbitrary JavaScript files on the server. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where images and other safe file types can be uploaded and included. Sites currently using 2.5.4 (file-manager-advanced-shortcode) should be updated to 2.6.0 (advanced-file-manager-pro-premium).",

The vulnerability allows including and executing arbitrary JavaScript files due to **improper control of the filename**. |\n| CWE-22 | Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. This represents the **local file inclusion** vulnerability, which is a type of path traversal. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-98, a variant of CWE-94 (Improper Control of Generation of Code), which describes the specific case of PHP remote file inclusion. CWE-22 (Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory) is also relevant as it represents the underlying path traversal issue that enables the file inclusion. CWE-98 is a more specific case of CWE-22, and thus it is chosen as primary.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe98[\"CWE-98: Improper Control of Filename for Include/Require Statement in PHP Program ('PHP Remote File Inclusion')\"]\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\"]\n\n    cwe98 -->|CHILDOF| cwe94\n    cwe22 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe98\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe98 primary\n    class cwe22 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper control of filename** in the include/require statement, leading to **local file inclusion**, which allows the attacker to include and execute arbitrary JavaScript files on the server.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary vulnerability is CWE-98 because the **root cause** is the **improper control of the filename** used in the include/require statement, which leads to the inclusion of arbitrary files. CWE-22 is a secondary weakness that represents the path traversal aspect of the **local file inclusion** vulnerability.
