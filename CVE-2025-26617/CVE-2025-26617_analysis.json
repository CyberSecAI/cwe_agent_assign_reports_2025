The root cause is the lack of proper neutralization of special elements in an SQL command. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship that influenced the decision was the direct match of the vulnerability description to the definition of CWE-89. The retriever results also strongly suggested CWE-89 as the top candidate. There are no other relationships such as parent-child or chain relationships were considered as they do not apply in this case since the root cause is directly related to SQL Injection.
