  "description": "A vulnerability was found in mariazevedo88 travels-java-api up to 5.0.1 and classified as problematic. Affected by this issue is the function doFilterInternal of the file travels-java-api-master\\src\\main\\java\\io\\github\\mariazevedo88\\travelsjavaapi\\filters\\JwtAuthenticationTokenFilter.java of the component JWT Secret Handler. The manipulation leads to **use of hard-coded cryptographic key** . The attack may be launched remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation is known to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.",

CWE-321 is a variant of CWE-798, representing a more specific case of using hard-coded credentials, which in this case, are cryptographic keys. This specificity made CWE-321 the preferred choice. There are no chain relationships that influence our decision.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe321[\"CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key\"]\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    \n    cwe321 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe321 primary\n    class cwe798 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **use of a hard-coded cryptographic key** (CWE-321), which directly leads to the potential for attackers to forge JWT tokens and gain unauthorized access to the system. The chain is relatively short and direct:\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** CWE-321 (**Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key**) - The cryptographic key is hard-coded in the source code.\n2.  **Impact:** Allows attackers to generate valid JWT tokens and gain unauthorized access.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly pointed towards CWE-321 (**Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key**) as the primary weakness, supported by the vulnerability description and the CVE reference content which clearly states that the vulnerability stems from the hardcoding of the JWT secret key. The retriever results also listed CWE-321 as a high-ranking candidate.\n\nThe relationship analysis confirmed this choice, with CWE-321 being a more specific variant of CWE-798 (**Use of Hard-coded Credentials**).
