  "query": "A vulnerability was found in mariazevedo88 travels-java-api up to 5.0.1 and classified as problematic. Affected by this issue is the function doFilterInternal of the file travels-java-api-master\\src\\main\\java\\io\\github\\mariazevedo88\\travelsjavaapi\\filters\\JwtAuthenticationTokenFilter.java of the component JWT Secret Handler. The manipulation leads to use of hard-coded cryptographic key . The attack may be launched remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation is known to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.",
