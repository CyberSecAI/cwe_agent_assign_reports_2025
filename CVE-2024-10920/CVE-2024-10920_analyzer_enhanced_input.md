### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **use of hard-coded cryptographic key**
- **product:** mariazevedo88 travels-java-api
- **version:** up to 5.0.1
- **component:** JWT Secret Handler

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content is related to CVE-2024-10920.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the hardcoding of the JWT secret key within the `travels-java-api` project.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Hardcoded JWT secret key: The JWT secret key is directly embedded in the source code, specifically in the `JwtAuthenticationTokenFilter.java` file.
- Exposure of secret key: As the project is open-source, the hardcoded secret key is easily accessible to anyone.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary user impersonation: Attackers can use the exposed secret key to generate valid JWT tokens.
- Unauthorized access: With forged tokens, attackers can gain access to any user's permissions and perform unauthorized actions.

**Attack vectors:**
- Publicly accessible source code: The open-source nature of the project allows anyone to inspect the code and retrieve the secret key.
- Generation of valid JWT tokens: Once the secret key is obtained, attackers can create tokens for any user and gain unauthorized access.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Access to source code: Attackers must be able to access the source code of the `travels-java-api` project.
- Ability to generate JWT tokens: Attackers need to be able to generate JWT tokens using the exposed secret key.
