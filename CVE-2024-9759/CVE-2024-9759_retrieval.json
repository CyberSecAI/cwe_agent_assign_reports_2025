This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Tungsten Automation Power PDF. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of GIF files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.

This can lead to an out-of-bounds read, specifically a read past the end of an allocated buffer.\\n- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists within the GIF file parsing functionality of the application.\\n- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to disclose sensitive information. It is also noted that this vulnerability could be combined with others to achieve arbitrary code execution.\\n- **Attack vectors**: User interaction is required.

This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Tungsten Automation Power PDF. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of GIF files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.
