# Analysis for CVE-2025-0477

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-326 | Inadequate Encryption Strength | 0.9 | Class | Primary | Allowed-with-Review |
| CWE-311 | Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data | 0.6 | Class | Secondary | Discouraged |
| CWE-916 | Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort | 0.5 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-326, which is a Class-level CWE. While it would be ideal to find a more specific Base or Variant CWE, the description focuses on the general inadequacy of the encryption strength, without specifying a particular broken algorithm or insufficient key size. CWE-311 is considered as a related weakness, since weak encryption could also be seen as missing encryption. CWE-916 relates to password hashing issues, which is potentially relevant given that the impact involves extracting passwords.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **weak encryption methodology** (CWE-326). This leads to the ability of a threat actor to extract passwords belonging to other users of the application. The root cause is the inadequate encryption, and the impact is password extraction.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is strongly based on the provided evidence. The **rootcause** is explicitly stated as a **"weak encryption methodology"**. The advisory also details vulnerabilities CVE-2025-0497 and CVE-2025-0498. The primary focus remains on the core issue of inadequate encryption strength.

The Retriever results also point towards CWE-326, further supporting its selection. While other CWEs like CWE-916 (Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort) and CWE-311 (Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data) are considered, CWE-326 is the most direct representation of the stated weakness.

The selection of CWE-326 is at the optimal level of specificity, given that the provided information does not specify the exact type of encryption weakness (e.g., broken algorithm, short key length).
# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).

## CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores or transmits sensitive data using an encryption scheme that is theoretically sound, but is not strong enough for the level of protection required.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-294: Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A capture-replay flaw exists when the design of the product makes it possible for a malicious user to sniff network traffic and bypass authentication by replaying it to the server in question to the same effect as the original message (or with minor changes).
