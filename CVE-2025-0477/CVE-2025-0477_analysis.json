While it would be ideal to find a more specific Base or Variant CWE, the description focuses on the general inadequacy of the encryption strength, without specifying a particular broken algorithm or insufficient key size. CWE-311 is considered as a related weakness, since weak encryption could also be seen as missing encryption. CWE-916 relates to password hashing issues, which is potentially relevant given that the impact involves extracting passwords.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe326[\"CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength\"]\n    cwe311[\"CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\"]\n    cwe916[\"CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort\"]\n    \n    cwe326 -->|PEEROF| cwe311\n    cwe326 -->|PARENTOF| cwe916\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe326 primary\n    class cwe311,cwe916 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **weak encryption methodology** (CWE-326). This leads to the ability of a threat actor to extract passwords belonging to other users of the application. The root cause is the inadequate encryption, and the impact is password extraction.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is strongly based on the provided evidence. The **rootcause** is explicitly stated as a **\"weak encryption methodology\"**. The advisory also details vulnerabilities CVE-2025-0497 and CVE-2025-0498. The primary focus remains on the core issue of inadequate encryption strength.\n\nThe Retriever results also point towards CWE-326, further supporting its selection. While other CWEs like CWE-916 (Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort) and CWE-311 (Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data) are considered, CWE-326 is the most direct representation of the stated weakness.\n\nThe selection of CWE-326 is at the optimal level of specificity, given that the provided information does not specify the exact type of encryption weakness (e.g., broken algorithm, short key length).\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
