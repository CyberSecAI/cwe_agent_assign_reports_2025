  "vulnerability_info": "VulnerabilityInfo(cve_id='CVE-2024-6254', description='The Brizy - Page Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.5.1. This is due to **missing or incorrect nonce validation** on form submissions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to submit forms intended for public use as another user via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. On sites where unfiltered_html is enabled, this can lead to the admin unknowingly adding a Stored **Cross-Site Scripting** payload.', key_phrases={'rootcause': 'missing or incorrect nonce validation', 'weakness': ['Cross-Site Scripting', 'cross-site request forgery'], 'impact': 'submit forms as another user', 'vector': 'forged request', 'attacker': 'unauthenticated attackers', 'product': 'Brizy - Page Builder plugin for WordPress', 'version': 'all versions up to and including 2.5.1', 'component': ''}, reference_content=\"Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\\n\\n**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on form submissions within the Brizy \u2013 Page Builder plugin.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\\n*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The primary vulnerability is CSRF, which allows an attacker to forge requests on behalf of a logged-in user.\\n\\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\\n*   **Form Submission as Another User:** An attacker can trick a site administrator into performing actions through forged requests, such as submitting forms intended for public use.\\n*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** On sites where `unfiltered_html` is enabled, an attacker can inject a stored XSS payload into the site through the forged form submissions. This can lead to further compromise, such as unauthorized access to the admin interface or data exfiltration, when the malicious payload is triggered.\\n\\n**Attack Vectors:**\\n*   **Forged Request:** The attacker crafts a malicious link or form that is designed to submit data to the vulnerable form endpoint in the plugin.\\n*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in site administrator into clicking on the malicious link or submitting the malicious form.\\n\\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\\n*   **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to initiate the attack.\\n*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker must be able to trick an administrator into clicking a link or submitting a form.\\n*   **Knowledge of vulnerable form endpoints:** The attacker needs to know which forms lack proper nonce validation and how to craft requests for them.\\n\\n**Additional Notes:**\\n*   The provided changelog in the first content snippet does not explicitly mention a security fix. However, the second content snippet from Wordfence indicates that the vulnerability was patched in version 2.5.2.\\n* The Wordfence article provides a CVSS score of 4.3 (Medium) and a CVSS vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N.\", similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {}, 'top_cwes_by_threshold': {}}}, similarity_summary=SimilarityInsight(consensus_cwe='', top_cwes=[], confidence_levels={}, total_samples=0), analysis='', analysis_with_relationships='', criticism='', resolution='', relevant_cwes=[{'metadata': {'doc_id': '352', 'name': 'Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'rootcause:missing or incorrect nonce validation', 'keyphrase': 'missing or incorrect nonce validation', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'weakness:Cross-Site Scripting', 'keyphrase': 'Cross-Site Scripting', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'weakness:cross-site request forgery', 'keyphrase': 'cross-site request forgery', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'impact:submit forms as another user', 'keyphrase': 'submit forms as another user', 'type': 'impact'}, {'id': 'vector:forged request', 'keyphrase': 'forged request', 'type': 'vector'}, {'id': 'attacker:unauthenticated attackers', 'keyphrase': 'unauthenticated attackers', 'type': 'attacker'}, {'id': 'product:Brizy - Page Builder plugin for WordPress', 'keyphrase': 'Brizy - Page Builder plugin for WordPress', 'type': 'product'}, {'id': 'version:all versions up to and including 2.5.1', 'keyphrase': 'all versions up to and including 2.5.1', 'type': 'version'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(818.6878448199955)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '116', 'name': 'Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.

    "enhanced_query": "# Vulnerability Description\n\n    The Brizy - Page Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.5.1. This is due to **missing or incorrect nonce validation** on form submissions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to submit forms intended for public use as another user via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. On sites where unfiltered_html is enabled, this can lead to the admin unknowingly adding a Stored **Cross-Site Scripting** payload.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'missing or incorrect nonce validation'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1.
