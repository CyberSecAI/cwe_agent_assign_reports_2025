Attackers can inject malicious parameters into the JDBC URL, triggering JNDI injection during the process when the JDBC Driver uses this URL to connect to the database. This could lead to remote code execution. JNDI injection is possible via the JDBC connection property krbJAASFile for the Java Authentication and Authorization Service (JAAS). Using untrusted parameters in the krbJAASFile and/or remote host can trigger JNDI injection in the JDBC URL through the krbJAASFile.
