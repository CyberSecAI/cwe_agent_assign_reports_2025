Here's an extraction of the vulnerability information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nAllows high privilege users (e.g., admin) to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks, even when `unfiltered_html` capability is disallowed.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n1.  Access the Shortcode Generator.\n2.  Add a new post.\n3.  Intercept the request.\n4.  Inject a payload (e.g., `333\"test='%20onmouseover=alert(779)%20test='%20//`) into the `ttp_parent_class` parameter.\n5.  Add the shortcode to a page and view the page to trigger the XSS.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   High privilege user (e.g., admin, editor+)\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   Fixed in version 4.4.2\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2024-9236\n*   **CVSS:** 3.5 (Low)\n*   **Original Researcher:** Krugov Artyom\n*   **Submitter:** Krugov Artyom\n*   **References:**\n    *   [https://research.cleantalk.org/CVE-2024-9236/](https://research.cleantalk.org/CVE-2024-9236/)\n*   **OWASP Top 10:** A7: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)\n*   **CWE:** CWE-79\n*   **WPVDB ID:** fd06ba56-37dd-4c23-ae7c-ab8de40d1645\n*   **Timeline:**\n    *   Publicly Published: 2024-09-04\n    *   Added: 2024-10-03\n    *   Last Updated: 2024-10-03",
