  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-47848:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability is caused by a flaw in the PageTriage extension where blocked users were still able to review or unreview articles. This was a regression introduced by a previous change.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Missing Authorization/Authentication:** The core issue is that the PageTriage extension was not properly checking if a user was blocked before allowing them to perform review/unreview actions. This implies a failure to correctly implement authorization controls for these specific actions.\n- **Logic Error:** The original code logic did not correctly account for blocked users who also had the autopatrolled or patroller rights, which were checked after the block check.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Bypass of Block Mechanism:** Blocked users could bypass the intended block restrictions, which undermines the purpose of user blocking functionality.\n- **Potential for Misuse:** Malicious blocked users could potentially abuse the ability to review or unreview articles, disrupting content management workflows or causing other problems on a wiki.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- A blocked user with patroller or autopatroller permissions would be able to navigate to a page and use the PageTriage review functionality.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- An attacker would need to be a user who has been blocked.\n- The user would also need to have the patroller or autopatrolled permissions.\n- The attacker needs to be logged into the system.\n\n**Technical Details**\nThe vulnerability resided in the `ApiPageTriageAction.php` file within the `PageTriage` extension. The patch fixed this issue by adding a check for blocked users before any other permission checks to prevent blocked users from performing review/unreview actions. Specifically, the fix includes the following changes:\n\n- Added a check using  `$patrolPermissionStatus->isBlocked()` and `$autopatrolledPermissionStatus->isBlocked()` to determine if the user is blocked.\n- If blocked the function `dieBlocked()` is called, and the function exits, thus not allowing the user to proceed with any reviewing or unreviewing actions.\n- The logic was updated for clarity and readability, by checking for the block status before the role checks.\n\nThe fix was applied to the master, REL1_42, and wmf/1.43.0-wmf.28 branches of the PageTriage extension.",

Although a more specific CWE could be considered, the current evidence supports the general \"Incorrect Authorization\" as the root cause. CWE-200, representing the impact of sensitive information exposure, is a parent of more specific information exposure CWEs. The hierarchical analysis guided the selection of CWE-863 as a root cause, and CWE-200 as an impact.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe863 -->|CAN_LEAD_TO| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with **Incorrect Authorization (CWE-863)**. Blocked users were incorrectly authorized to perform review actions. This leads to the impact of **Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor (CWE-200)**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified the **missing authorization** as the root cause. The PageTriage extension **failed to correctly check** if a user was blocked before allowing them to perform review/unreview actions. This aligns well with **CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization)**. The vulnerability description clearly states this **failure in authorization logic** where blocked users with specific permissions could bypass the block. The fix implemented directly addresses this authorization flaw. The secondary impact is the **Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor (CWE-200)**, because the incorrectly authorized users can now access and potentially modify information that they should not have access to.\n\nThe assessment is heavily based on the provided evidence, especially the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section. The retriever results also point to relevant CWEs like **CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization)**. While a more specific child of CWE-863 might exist, the current evidence sufficiently supports the selection of CWE-863 as the primary weakness.\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).

The system performs an authorization check, but the check is **incorrect** because it allows blocked users with certain permissions (patroller or autopatrolled) to bypass the intended block restrictions and perform actions like reviewing or unreviewing articles",
