## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-47848:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a flaw in the PageTriage extension where blocked users were still able to review or unreview articles. This was a regression introduced by a previous change.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authorization/Authentication:** The core issue is that the PageTriage extension was not properly checking if a user was blocked before allowing them to perform review/unreview actions. This implies a failure to correctly implement authorization controls for these specific actions.
- **Logic Error:** The original code logic did not correctly account for blocked users who also had the autopatrolled or patroller rights, which were checked after the block check.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Bypass of Block Mechanism:** Blocked users could bypass the intended block restrictions, which undermines the purpose of user blocking functionality.
- **Potential for Misuse:** Malicious blocked users could potentially abuse the ability to review or unreview articles, disrupting content management workflows or causing other problems on a wiki.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A blocked user with patroller or autopatroller permissions would be able to navigate to a page and use the PageTriage review functionality.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need to be a user who has been blocked.
- The user would also need to have the patroller or autopatrolled permissions.
- The attacker needs to be logged into the system.

**Technical Details**
The vulnerability resided in the `ApiPageTriageAction.php` file within the `PageTriage` extension. The patch fixed this issue by adding a check for blocked users before any other permission checks to prevent blocked users from performing review/unreview actions. Specifically, the fix includes the following changes:

- Added a check using  `$patrolPermissionStatus->isBlocked()` and `$autopatrolledPermissionStatus->isBlocked()` to determine if the user is blocked.
- If blocked the function `dieBlocked()` is called, and the function exits, thus not allowing the user to proceed with any reviewing or unreviewing actions.
- The logic was updated for clarity and readability, by checking for the block status before the role checks.

The fix was applied to the master, REL1_42, and wmf/1.43.0-wmf.28 branches of the PageTriage extension.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control

**Authentication**:
Determines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.

* Example phrases: "user must log in", "lack of login check", "bypasses login"
* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.

  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* – used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).

**Authorization**:
Determines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do. It decides access *after* identity is verified.

* Example phrases: "unauthorized access", "regular user can access admin panel", "role checks are missing"
* CWE relevance: use CWEs like 862, 863, 285 for authorization errors:

  * **CWE-862**: *Missing Authorization* – the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all.
  * **CWE-863**: *Incorrect Authorization* – the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).
  * **CWE-285**: *Improper Authorization* – general category for any flawed authorization logic or design.

**Access Control**:
A broader term that includes both authentication and authorization. Governs how resources are protected and who can access them under what conditions.

* CWE relevance:

  * **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* – top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear.
  * This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.

## Mapping Discussion – Common Misclassification Patterns

### 1. **CWE-306 vs CWE-862**:

* **306** is about lack of **authentication** (e.g., *no login required at all*).
* **862** is about lack of **authorization** *after* authentication (e.g., *admin check missing*).
* ✅ Example CWE-306: *“An unauthenticated attacker can invoke the password reset API.”*
* ✅ Example CWE-862: *“An authenticated user without admin privileges can delete any user account.”*

### 2. **CWE-285 vs CWE-284**:

* **285** is specific to authorization flaws – it's a better choice than 284 **if** the issue involves *improper or missing role checks*.
* **284** should be reserved for general access control issues when it’s unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.

## Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification

**Phrase like "unauthorized access" is not enough.**

* If you **cannot determine whether identity was checked**, assume it’s **authorization** and consider 862 or 863.
* If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** → CWE-306.
* If the **access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced**, but it's not due to missing checks, consider **CWE-284**.

---

## Good Mapping Examples

* ✅ **CWE-306**: “The endpoint `/admin/deleteUser` does not require any authentication.”
* ✅ **CWE-862**: “Any logged-in user can change any other user's email without being an admin.”
* ✅ **CWE-863**: “An admin check exists but incorrectly grants access to non-admin users.”
* ✅ **CWE-285**: “Application uses a static role check that fails when roles change dynamically.”
* ✅ **CWE-284**: “Inconsistent enforcement of access rules across services with unclear policy source.”

| ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |

| No role/privilege check after login                        | CWE-862        |
| Role check is present but flawed                           | CWE-863        |
| General or ambiguous authorization failure                 | CWE-285        |
| High-level access control problem with no clear root cause | CWE-284        |
