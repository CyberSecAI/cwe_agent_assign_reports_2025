  "description": "The Quiz Maker plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to time-based SQL Injection via the ays_questions parameter in all versions up to, and including, 6.5.8.3 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.",
  "key_phrases": {
    "rootcause": "insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query",
    "weakness": "time-based SQL injection",

  },
  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-6028:\n\n**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**\n   - The content from Wordfence explicitly mentions \"Quiz Maker <= 6.5.8.3 - Unauthenticated SQL Injection via 'ays\\_questions' Parameter\" and links it to CVE-2024-6028.\n   - The description aligns with the provided file diffs, referencing the `class-quiz-maker-public.php` file and SQL queries.\n\n**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n   - The vulnerability stems from insufficient escaping of the user-supplied `ays_questions` parameter.\n   - There is a lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.\n\n**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n    -  **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. This occurs because user input is directly incorporated into a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization, allowing the injection of malicious SQL code.\n    -  **Unauthenticated Access:** The SQL injection is unauthenticated, meaning that an attacker does not need to be logged into the WordPress system to exploit the vulnerability.\n\n**4. Impact of Exploitation:**\n   - **Data Breach:** Successful exploitation can lead to the extraction of sensitive data from the database, such as user information, quiz details, etc.\n   - **Complete Compromise:** The ability to execute arbitrary SQL queries can lead to complete database compromise and potentially, complete server compromise.\n\n**5. Attack Vectors:**\n   -  **HTTP Parameter Manipulation:** The attack vector is the `ays_questions` parameter, which can be manipulated using a specially crafted payload in HTTP requests.\n\n**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n    - **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need any specific privileges or to be authenticated in the WordPress system.\n    - **Network Access:**  The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected WordPress site.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n- The Wordfence content provides a very detailed breakdown of the vulnerability.\n- The vulnerability exists in all versions up to and including version 6.5.8.3 of the Quiz Maker plugin.\n- The recommended fix is to update to version 6.5.8.4 or any newer version which contains the patch.\n- The provided file diffs show the changes made in the `class-quiz-maker-public.php` to fix the vulnerability, mainly by preparing the SQL queries, preventing direct user input from affecting the SQL query execution, and sanitizing user input.",

The vulnerability description explicitly states that the Quiz Maker plugin is vulnerable to time-based SQL Injection due to **insufficient escaping** and **lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. The CVE reference links confirm this, stating that the root cause is the **insufficient escaping** of the user-supplied `ays_questions` parameter and a **lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**.
