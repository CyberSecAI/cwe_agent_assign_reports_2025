# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-6028

## Vulnerability Description
The Quiz Maker plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to time-based SQL Injection via the ays_questions parameter in all versions up to, and including, 6.5.8.3 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**
- **weakness:** **time-based SQL injection**
- **impact:** extract sensitive information from the database
- **attacker:** unauthenticated attackers
- **product:** Quiz Maker plugin for WordPress
- **version:** all versions up to and including 6.5.8.3
- **component:** ays_questions parameter

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-6028:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**
   - The content from Wordfence explicitly mentions "Quiz Maker <= 6.5.8.3 - Unauthenticated SQL Injection via 'ays\_questions' Parameter" and links it to CVE-2024-6028.
   - The description aligns with the provided file diffs, referencing the `class-quiz-maker-public.php` file and SQL queries.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The vulnerability stems from insufficient escaping of the user-supplied `ays_questions` parameter.
   - There is a lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    -  **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. This occurs because user input is directly incorporated into a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization, allowing the injection of malicious SQL code.
    -  **Unauthenticated Access:** The SQL injection is unauthenticated, meaning that an attacker does not need to be logged into the WordPress system to exploit the vulnerability.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Data Breach:** Successful exploitation can lead to the extraction of sensitive data from the database, such as user information, quiz details, etc.
   - **Complete Compromise:** The ability to execute arbitrary SQL queries can lead to complete database compromise and potentially, complete server compromise.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   -  **HTTP Parameter Manipulation:** The attack vector is the `ays_questions` parameter, which can be manipulated using a specially crafted payload in HTTP requests.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    - **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need any specific privileges or to be authenticated in the WordPress system.
    - **Network Access:**  The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected WordPress site.

**Additional Details:**

- The Wordfence content provides a very detailed breakdown of the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability exists in all versions up to and including version 6.5.8.3 of the Quiz Maker plugin.
- The recommended fix is to update to version 6.5.8.4 or any newer version which contains the patch.
- The provided file diffs show the changes made in the `class-quiz-maker-public.php` to fix the vulnerability, mainly by preparing the SQL queries, preventing direct user input from affecting the SQL query execution, and sanitizing user input.
