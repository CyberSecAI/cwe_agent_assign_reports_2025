## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain appears simple:
1.  **WEAKNESS:** Some unspecified error leads to...
2.  Impact: Unauthorized disclosure of information.

The provided information is too vague to identify the root cause.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis focused on identifying a CWE that accurately reflects the "**impact: unauthorized disclosure of information**". Given the limited information, I've selected CWE-200 as the most appropriate, albeit generic, classification.

The decision is heavily based on the vulnerability description's mention of "unauthorized disclosure of information". Without further details on the root cause or specific mechanisms involved, a more precise mapping is not possible. The retriever results suggest other CWEs, but they require more specific evidence that is not present.
