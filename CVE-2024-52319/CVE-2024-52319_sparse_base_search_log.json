Where the fault address may be not aligned with the huge page size. Then, folio_zero_user() may call clear_gigantic_page() with the address, while clear_gigantic_page() requires the address to be huge page size aligned. So, this may cause memory corruption or information leak, addtional, use more obvious naming addr_hint instead of addr for clear_gigantic_page().",
