  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved mm use aligned address in clear_gigantic_page() In current kernel, hugetlb_no_page() calls folio_zero_user() with the fault address. Where the fault address may be not aligned with the huge page size. Then, folio_zero_user() may call clear_gigantic_page() with the address, while clear_gigantic_page() requires the address to be huge page size aligned. So, this may cause **memory corruption** or information leak, addtional, use more obvious naming addr_hint instead of addr for clear_gigantic_page().",

A possible related weakness is CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read), where data is read past the end of the buffer. CWE-787 is a base-level CWE, providing a good level of specificity. Both CWE-787 and CWE-125 are children of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe125 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe125 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an incorrect address being used in `clear_gigantic_page()`. This leads to **memory corruption** (CWE-787) as data is written to an unintended memory location. This can potentially lead to an information leak, which could involve reading sensitive data from an out-of-bounds memory location (CWE-125).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description, which states that `clear_gigantic_page()` requires an address aligned with the huge page size, but `folio_zero_user()` may call it with an unaligned address, leading to **memory corruption** or information leak.\n\nThe retriever results show that CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is the top candidate, which aligns well with the **memory corruption** aspect of the vulnerability. CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) is also a potential candidate given the possibility of an information leak.\n\nThe primary CWE is CWE-787 because the core issue is writing to an incorrect memory location due to the unaligned address. The possibility of information leak makes CWE-125 a secondary consideration.\n\nThe selection of CWE-787 and CWE-125 is at the base level of abstraction, providing the most specific representation of the weaknesses based on the available evidence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n##
