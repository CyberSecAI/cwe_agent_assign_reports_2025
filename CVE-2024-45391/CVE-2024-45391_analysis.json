  "description": "Tina is an open-source content management system (CMS). Sites building with Tina CMSs command line interface (CLI) prior to version 1.6.2 that use a search token may be vulnerable to the search token being leaked via lock file (tina-lock.json). Administrators of Tina-enabled websites with search setup should rotate their key immediately. This issue has been patched in @tinacms/cli version 1.6.2. Upgrading and rotating the search token is required for the proper fix.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2024-45391:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from the `@tinacms/cli` tool writing the search configuration, including the search indexer token, to the `tina-lock.json` file. This lock file is often committed to version control systems, inadvertently exposing the sensitive search token.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Information Exposure:** The primary weakness is the unintentional exposure of the search indexer token. This token should be treated as a secret, and its inclusion in a publicly accessible lock file constitutes a security risk.\n*   **Inadequate Filtering:** The `@tinacms/cli` tool lacked proper filtering to exclude sensitive information from being written to the lock file.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Confidentiality Breach:** The leaked search token can be used by unauthorized parties to potentially gain access to sensitive data or resources associated with the search functionality.\n*  **Unauthorized Access:**  An attacker could potentially use the exposed search token to perform unauthorized actions on the search index.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Network:** An attacker could obtain the search token by accessing the publicly available `tina-lock.json` file, typically through a version control repository. This is a network-based attack vector, as it is over the network where the attacker can retrieve the token.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Access to the `tina-lock.json` file:** The attacker needs access to the `tina-lock.json` file, which could be achieved through public repository access.\n*   **No special privileges or user interaction required:** The attacker does not need any special privileges or to interact with a user to retrieve the search token.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n*   The vulnerability was present in versions of `@tinacms/cli` prior to `1.6.2`.\n*   The fix involves filtering the search configuration from the output written to `tina-lock.json`.\n*  The fix was introduced in commit `110f1ce`.\n*   The vulnerability is classified as high severity, with a CVSS score of 7.5.\n*   The CVE identifier is CVE-2024-45391, and the related GitHub Security Advisory is GHSA-4qrm-9h4r-v2fx.\n*   The vulnerability is related to CWE-200 (Information Exposure).",

The **search token** was written to the tina-lock.json file, which is often committed to version control. |\n| CWE-538 | Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | The **search token**, which is sensitive information, was inserted into the `tina-lock.json` file, which is externally accessible. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship that influenced the decision was the parent-child relationship between CWE-669 (Incorrect Behavior Order: Concurrent Execution Expected Order Violation) and CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data). While CWE-669 represents a broader category of flaws related to incorrect behavior order, CWE-201 provides a more specific and accurate description of the vulnerability.\n\nThe other relationship was the parent-child relationship between CWE-212 (Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer) and CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data). While CWE-212 represents a broader category of flaws related to improper removal of sensitive data, CWE-201 provides a more specific and accurate description of the vulnerability.\n\nThe relationship between CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data) and CWE-538 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory) influenced the decision to include CWE-538 as a secondary CWE.

This lock file is often committed to version control systems, inadvertently exposing the sensitive search token (CWE-538).

The `tina-lock.json` file is often committed to version control systems, inadvertently exposing the sensitive search token.\n\nThe evidence for selecting CWE-201 as the primary weakness is strong, as the vulnerability description explicitly states that the search token is written to the `tina-lock.json` file.

CWE-201 is more specific in that it focuses on the insertion of sensitive information into sent data, which is the root cause of the vulnerability.\n\nCWE-538 was selected as a secondary CWE because the sensitive information was placed in an externally-accessible file, which aligns with the vulnerability where the search token is written to a lock file that is often committed to version control.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n- CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\n- CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory",
