  "description": "An exposure of sensitive information vulnerability exists in the Rockwell Automation FactoryTalk System Service. A malicious user could exploit this vulnerability by starting a back-up or restore process, which temporarily exposes private keys, passwords, pre-shared keys, and database folders when they are temporarily copied to an interim folder. This vulnerability is due to the **lack of explicit permissions set on the backup folder**. If private keys are obtained by a malicious user, they could impersonate resources on the secured network.",

It does contain information about CVE-2024-6325 and CVE-2024-6236.\n\n**CVE-2024-6325**\n\n*   **Root Cause:** The FactoryTalk Policy Manager v6.40 insecurely stores private keys with read and execute privileges for the 'Everyone' Windows group.\n*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Improper Privilege Management (CWE-269). Unsecured storage of private keys.\n*  **Impact of Exploitation:** A malicious user with local access to the machine can obtain private keys. These keys could be used to impersonate resources on the secured network. Additionally, this vulnerability could allow a threat actor to exploit CVE-2022-1161 and CVE-2022-1161 if the mitigation for these CVEs was done using CIP security.\n*   **Attack Vectors:** Local access to the machine.\n*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system where FactoryTalk Policy Manager v6.40 is installed.\n\n**CVE-2024-6236**\n\n*   **Root Cause:** The FactoryTalk System Service temporarily exposes sensitive information (private keys, passwords, pre-shared keys, database folders) during backup and restore processes due to a lack of explicit permissions on the backup folder.\n*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Improper Privilege Management (CWE-269). Exposure of sensitive information during backup/restore operations.\n*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A malicious user could obtain private keys if they are able to trigger a backup or restore process. The obtained private keys can be used to impersonate resources on the secured network.\n*   **Attack Vectors:** Local access to the machine, ability to initiate backup/restore process.\n*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system where FactoryTalk System Service is installed and be able to trigger backup/restore. User interaction is also required.\n\nThe document also provides detailed steps on how to mitigate these vulnerabilities.",

It focuses on the **incorrect default permissions** being the root cause. CWE-530, a Variant, specifies the vulnerability as relating to the exposure of a backup file, and CWE-497 specifies the exposure of sensitive system information. While the vulnerability involves exposure, it is a consequence of the **lack of explicit permissions**, making CWE-276 the root cause. The other CWEs are related to the impact of the **incorrect permissions**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe276[\"CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions\"]\n    cwe530[\"CWE-530: Exposure of Backup File to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\"]\n    cwe497[\"CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\"]\n\n    cwe530 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    cwe497 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe276 primary\n    class cwe530,cwe497 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of explicit permissions** on the backup folder (CWE-276). This leads to sensitive information (private keys, passwords, etc.) being exposed in the backup file (CWE-530 and CWE-497) to an unauthorized control sphere. A malicious user who gains access to these keys could then impersonate resources on the secured network.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis, supported by the \"**rootcause:** **lack of explicit permissions set on the backup folder**\" statement in the vulnerability description, strongly points to CWE-276 (Incorrect Default Permissions) as the primary weakness. The CVE reference summary also supports this by stating, \"The FactoryTalk System Service temporarily exposes sensitive information (private keys, passwords, pre-shared keys, database folders) during backup and restore processes due to a **lack of explicit permissions** on the backup folder.\"\n\nThe Retriever Results also suggest CWE-276 as the top match. The relationship analysis clarifies that the exposure vulnerabilities (CWE-530, CWE-497) are consequences of the **incorrect permissions**, not the root cause. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-276 at the Base level and the others at Variant and Base levels respectively.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
