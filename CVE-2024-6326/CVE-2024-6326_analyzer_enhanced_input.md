## Vulnerability Description
An exposure of sensitive information vulnerability exists in the Rockwell Automation FactoryTalk System Service. A malicious user could exploit this vulnerability by starting a back-up or restore process, which temporarily exposes private keys, passwords, pre-shared keys, and database folders when they are temporarily copied to an interim folder. This vulnerability is due to the **lack of explicit permissions set on the backup folder**. If private keys are obtained by a malicious user, they could impersonate resources on the secured network.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **lack of explicit permissions set on the backup folder**
- **impact:** and database folders and exposes private keys and exposure of sensitive information and passwords and pre-shared keys
- **vector:** starting a back-up or restore process
- **attacker:** malicious user
- **product:** Rockwell Automation FactoryTalk System Service

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content does not contain information about CVE-2024-6326. It does contain information about CVE-2024-6325 and CVE-2024-6236.

**CVE-2024-6325**

*   **Root Cause:** The FactoryTalk Policy Manager v6.40 insecurely stores private keys with read and execute privileges for the 'Everyone' Windows group.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Improper Privilege Management (CWE-269). Unsecured storage of private keys.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** A malicious user with local access to the machine can obtain private keys. These keys could be used to impersonate resources on the secured network. Additionally, this vulnerability could allow a threat actor to exploit CVE-2022-1161 and CVE-2022-1161 if the mitigation for these CVEs was done using CIP security.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Local access to the machine.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system where FactoryTalk Policy Manager v6.40 is installed.

**CVE-2024-6236**

*   **Root Cause:** The FactoryTalk System Service temporarily exposes sensitive information (private keys, passwords, pre-shared keys, database folders) during backup and restore processes due to a lack of explicit permissions on the backup folder.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Improper Privilege Management (CWE-269). Exposure of sensitive information during backup/restore operations.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A malicious user could obtain private keys if they are able to trigger a backup or restore process. The obtained private keys can be used to impersonate resources on the secured network.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Local access to the machine, ability to initiate backup/restore process.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system where FactoryTalk System Service is installed and be able to trigger backup/restore. User interaction is also required.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set ‚Äì Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* üîç *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* üîç *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion ‚Äì CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### üî∏ CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ‚úÖ *‚ÄúA user created with the ‚Äòguest‚Äô role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.‚Äù*

#### üî∏ CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ‚úÖ *‚ÄúThe backup service runs as root but only needs read access.‚Äù*

#### üî∏ CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### üî∏ CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ‚úÖ *‚ÄúUser can access another user‚Äôs invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.‚Äù*

## Mapping Examples ‚Äì Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *‚ÄúUser can escalate privileges to admin.‚Äù*
> ‚ùå Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged ‚Äì only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ‚úÖ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**

* ‚úÖ **CWE-250**: *‚ÄúInstaller runs with system-level privileges but doesn't require them to install files in the user directory.‚Äù*
* ‚úÖ **CWE-284**: *‚ÄúInconsistent access rules between UI and backend for sensitive endpoints.‚Äù*
