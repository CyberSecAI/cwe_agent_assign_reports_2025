  "vulnerability_info": "VulnerabilityInfo(cve_id='CVE-2024-56733', description='Password Pusher is an open source application to communicate sensitive information over the web. A vulnerability has been reported in versions 1.50.3 and prior where an attacker can copy the session cookie before a user logs out, potentially allowing **session hijacking**. Although the session token is replaced and invalidated upon logout, if an attacker manages to capture the session cookie before this process, they can use the token to gain unauthorized access to the users session until the token expires or is manually cleared. This vulnerability hinges on the attackers ability to access the session cookie during an active session, either through a man-in-the-middle attack, by exploiting another vulnerability like **XSS**, or via direct access to the victims device. Although there is no direct resolution to this vulnerability, it is recommended to always use the latest version of Password Pusher to best mitigate risk. If self-hosting, ensure Password Pusher is hosted exclusively over SSL connections to encrypt traffic and prevent session cookies from being intercepted in transit. Additionally, implement best practices in local security to safeguard user systems, browsers, and data against unauthorized access.', key_phrases={'rootcause': '', 'weakness': ['session hijacking', 'XSS'], 'impact': 'gain unauthorized access', 'vector': '', 'attacker': 'attacker', 'product': 'Password Pusher', 'version': '1.50.3 and prior', 'component': ''}, reference_content=\"- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the fact that a session cookie can be copied before a user logs out, which can then be used to hijack the session. Although the session token is invalidated on logout, if captured beforehand, it remains valid until expiry or manual clearing.\\n- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Session token interception, potentially through man-in-the-middle attacks, XSS, or direct access to the victim's device.\\n- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to a user's session, allowing them to potentially perform actions as that user until the session expires or is manually cleared.\\n- **Attack vectors:** Man-in-the-middle attacks, exploiting XSS vulnerabilities, or gaining direct access to the victim's device to copy the session cookie.\\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to intercept or access the session cookie during an active user session. This could involve network interception (MitM), exploiting other vulnerabilities such as XSS, or direct access to the user's system. The attacker also needs high privileges according to the CVSS score.\", similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold':

    "enhanced_query": "# Vulnerability Description\n\n    Password Pusher is an open source application to communicate sensitive information over the web. A vulnerability has been reported in versions 1.50.3 and prior where an attacker can copy the session cookie before a user logs out, potentially allowing **session hijacking**. Although the session token is replaced and invalidated upon logout, if an attacker manages to capture the session cookie before this process, they can use the token to gain unauthorized access to the users session until the token expires or is manually cleared. This vulnerability hinges on the attackers ability to access the session cookie during an active session, either through a man-in-the-middle attack, by exploiting another vulnerability like **XSS**, or via direct access to the victims device. Although there is no direct resolution to this vulnerability, it is recommended to always use the latest version of Password Pusher to best mitigate risk. If self-hosting, ensure Password Pusher is hosted exclusively over SSL connections to encrypt traffic and prevent session cookies from being intercepted in transit. Additionally, implement best practices in local security to safeguard user systems, browsers, and data against unauthorized access.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## WEAKNESS: 'session hijacking'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this WEAKNESS:\n\n### 1.
