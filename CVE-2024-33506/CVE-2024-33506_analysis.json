CWE-497 is a more specific Base-level CWE that describes exposure of sensitive system information. CWE-497 is related to CWE-200 as a potential cause, and both relate to information exposure. The choice between these two comes down to the level of system-specific detail provided in the vulnerability description. Since the description mentions \"device summary\" and \"Administrative Domain (ADOM)\" it hints towards system level information.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe497[\"CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\"]\n\n    cwe497 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe497 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **lack of proper access control**, leading to the exposure of sensitive device summary information to an unauthorized actor.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on identifying the primary weakness, which is the exposure of sensitive information. The evidence directly states \"An exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized actor vulnerability [CWE-200]\". The description specifies that a remote authenticated attacker assigned to an Administrative Domain (ADOM) can access device summary of unauthorized ADOMs, supporting the identification of CWE-200.\n\nCWE-497 was considered due to its focus on system-level information exposure. Although the vulnerability description involves \"device summary\" and \"Administrative Domain (ADOM)\" which relate to system level information, the primary impact is still broader information exposure. CWE-200 is chosen as the primary because it reflects the high-level impact, while CWE-497 is a secondary CWE choice because it is a more specific category of information exposure that is related to system details, but it is not the primary issue.\n\nThe selection is based on the evidence provided, favoring the broader scope of CWE-200 as the primary weakness and considering the more specific CWE-497 as a relevant secondary weakness. Both are at appropriate levels of specificity, given the information available.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product requires authentication, but the product has an alternate path or channel that does not require authentication.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
