The vulnerability description explicitly states \"**incorrect privilege assignment**\" as the root cause.

CWE-266 is a Base level CWE, which is the preferred level for mapping root causes. The advisory guidance on privileges vs permissions also suggest this is a good mapping.\n\nCWE-863 (**Incorrect Authorization**) is a secondary weakness, because the **incorrect privilege assignment** allows the attacker to perform actions they should not be authorized to do.
