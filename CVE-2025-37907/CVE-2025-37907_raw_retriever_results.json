  "query": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved accel/ivpu Fix locking order in ivpu_job_submit Fix deadlock in job submission and abort handling. When a thread aborts currently executing jobs due to a fault, it first locks the global lock protecting submitted_jobs (#1). After the last job is destroyed, it proceeds to release the related context and locks file_priv (#2). Meanwhile, in the job submission thread, the file_priv lock (#2) is taken first, and then the submitted_jobs lock (#1) is obtained when a job is added to the submitted jobs list. CPU0 CPU1 ---- ---- (for example due to a fault) (jobs submissions keep coming) lock(&vdev->submitted_jobs_lock) #1 ivpu_jobs_abort_all() job_destroy() lock(&file_priv->lock) #2 lock(&vdev->submitted_jobs_lock) #1 file_priv_release() lock(&vdev->context_list_lock) lock(&file_priv->lock) #2 This order of locking causes a deadlock. To resolve this issue, change the order of locking in ivpu_job_submit().",
