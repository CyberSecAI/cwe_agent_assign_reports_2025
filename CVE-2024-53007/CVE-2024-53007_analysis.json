This API can be abused.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL API abuse leading to potential bypass of access control or data tampering.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**  Obtaining or manipulating data from the SQL database. This could lead to bypass of access control or tampering of data.\n\n**Attack vectors:**  Abuse of the ProjectWise Integration Server's SQL API by an authenticated user with application-level subject matter expertise. This is an insider threat.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:** Authenticated user with application-level subject matter expertise.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n*   Follow industry standard guidance on authentication of users including mandating robust 2FA.\n*   Follow industry standard guidance on regular and independent internal privileged access reviews.\n*   Minimize ProjectWise database user permissions.\n*   Upgrade to latest versions of ProjectWise Integration server and enable the SQL Allow List to help minimize the risk of malicious SQL queries to be executed.\n*   For ProjectWise Cloud users, open a service ticket to request enabling the SQL Allow List for your instance.\n*   Bentley is planning to deprecate the vulnerable API in future versions.\n```",

While other CWEs like CWE-943 are related to data query logic, CWE-89 is more specific to SQL injection, which is the stated impact.\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    cwe943[\"CWE-943: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Data Query Logic\"]\n    cwe138[\"CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output\"]\n\n    cwe89 -->|CHILDOF| cwe943\n    cwe943 -->|CHILDOF| cwe138\n    cwe138 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe89 primary\n    class cwe943 secondary\n    class cwe138,cwe74 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper neutralization** of SQL special elements which then leads to the ability to perform **SQL Injection**. The API allows authenticated users to execute SQL queries, but the application **fails to neutralize** special elements, leading to **SQL injection**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE selected is based on the clear evidence provided in the vulnerability description and CVE reference summary. The description states that the server \"allows unintended SQL query execution by an authenticated user\" and the summary explicitly mentions \"SQL API abuse leading to potential bypass of access control or data tampering.\" This directly corresponds to CWE-89, which involves **improper neutralization** of special elements in SQL commands. The confidence is high due to the explicit mention of SQL injection.\n\nOther CWEs were considered but not selected:\n\n*   CWE-943: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Data Query Logic - While relevant, CWE-89 is a more specific child of this class and accurately reflects the SQL injection vulnerability.\n*   CWE-20: Improper Input Validation - This is too general. The problem is not just any input validation issue; it's specifically about SQL injection.\n*   CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function - Authentication is present, but it does not prevent SQL injection.\n*   CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') - This is not applicable because the injection is in SQL, not OS commands.\n*   CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs - May be a factor, but it is secondary to the lack of neutralization.\n\nThe evidence is clear and the selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity.",
