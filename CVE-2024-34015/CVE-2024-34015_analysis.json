CWE-61 is a compound CWE, while CWE-59 is a base CWE. CWE-73 **External Control of File Name or Path** can precede CWE-59.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe59[\"CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')\"]\n    cwe61[\"CWE-61: UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following\"]\n    cwe73[\"CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\"]\n    \n    cwe61 -->|CHILDOF| cwe59\n    cwe73 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe59\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe59 primary\n    class cwe61,cwe73 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper symbolic link handling** (CWE-59), potentially influenced by external control of the file name or path (CWE-73), leading to sensitive information disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states \"**improper symbolic link handling**\" as the root cause, leading to sensitive information disclosure. The retriever results list CWE-61 **UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following** and CWE-59 **Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')** as top candidates. CWE-59 is the better fit as the base cause, while CWE-61 is a more specific compound case of the same **weakness**. CWE-73 **External Control of File Name or Path** is included as a potential factor influencing the vulnerability. The evidence is based on the vulnerability description.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-61: UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product, when opening a file or directory, does not sufficiently account for when the file is a symbolic link that resolves to a target outside of the intended control sphere.
