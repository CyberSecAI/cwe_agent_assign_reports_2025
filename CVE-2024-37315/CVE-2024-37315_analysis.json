An attacker with read-only access to a file is able to restore older versions of a document when the files_versions app is enabled. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server is upgraded to 26.0.12, 27.1.7 or 28.0.3 and that the Nextcloud Enterprise Server is upgraded to 23.0.12.16, 24.0.12.12, 25.0.13.6, 26.0.12, 27.1.7 or 28.0.3.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-37315:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from a lack of proper permission checks in the Nextcloud `files_versions` app. Specifically, read-only users were able to restore older versions of files, even when they lacked the necessary permissions to do so on the current version.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Incorrect Permission Checks:** The core issue is that the system didn't adequately verify user permissions before allowing a file version to be restored. This is a violation of the principle of least privilege.\n*   **Inadequate Share Status Checks:** The system failed to check the share status correctly, allowing users with read-only access to bypass restrictions related to version control.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Data Integrity Violation:** An attacker could revert a file to an older version, potentially causing data loss or corruption. This is a violation of data integrity, even though there is no confidentiality breach.\n*   **Unauthorized Modification:** While the attacker doesn't gain write access to the current file version, they effectively modify the file's state by restoring an older version, which could overwrite recent changes from other users.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Network:** The attack is exploitable over the network.\n*   **User Account:** The attacker needs a valid user account with at least read-only access to a file.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Read-Only Access:** The attacker needs an account with read-only privileges to a file.\n*   **`files_versions` App Enabled:** The `files_versions` app must be enabled on the Nextcloud instance.\n*   **User interaction**: User interaction is required.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n*   The vulnerability was fixed by implementing checks for share attributes when downloading, restoring, deleting, and labeling versions. This ensures that a user has the necessary permissions to perform these operations on older versions of a document, as well as the current version of the document.\n*   The fix was implemented in a series of commits, addressing different aspects of the versioning functionality.\n*   The vulnerability affects multiple versions of both Nextcloud Server and Nextcloud Enterprise Server. Patches are available for all affected versions.\n\nThe content from hackerone.com is not helpful as it requires login to view.",

While CWE-639 is more specific, the vulnerability description doesn't explicitly state that a \"user-controlled key\" is the direct cause. It's an authorization failure, and the key is how it's achieved. Thus, CWE-863 is chosen as the primary.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n    \n    cwe639 -->|CHILDOF| cwe863\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe639 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of root cause and weaknesses is as follows:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Incorrect Authorization** (CWE-863) in the `files_versions` app, specifically a **lack of proper permission checks**.\n2.  **Mechanism:** **Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key** (CWE-639) since the read-only user is able to restore an older version of the document.\n3.  **Impact:** An attacker with read-only access can restore older versions of a document, leading to **data integrity violation** and **unauthorized modification**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified a potential authorization issue due to the ability of read-only users to restore older versions of files. The retriever results highlighted CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key) and CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) as potential candidates.\n\nBased on the evidence from the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\", the vulnerability stems from a \"**lack of proper permission checks**\" within the Nextcloud `files_versions` app. This directly indicates an **incorrect authorization** mechanism, making CWE-863 the primary weakness.\n\nCWE-639 is chosen as a secondary CWE. It is more specific (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key), and the vulnerability description is that an attacker with read-only access (a key) is able to restore older versions of a document.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-863 representing the general authorization failure and CWE-639 highlighting the specific bypass mechanism.\n\n#
