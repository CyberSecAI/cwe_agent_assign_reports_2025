  "description": "Froxlor is open-source server administration software. A vulnerability in versions prior to 2.2.6 allows users (such as resellers or customers) to create accounts with the same email address as an existing account. This creates potential issues with account identification and security. This vulnerability can be exploited by authenticated users (e.g., reseller, customer) who can create accounts with the same email address that has already been used by another account, such as the admin. The attack vector is email-based, as the system **does not prevent multiple accounts from registering the same email address**, leading to possible conflicts and security issues. Version 2.2.6 fixes the issue.",

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information extracted from the content:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nUsers (resellers or customers) are able to create accounts with the same email address as an existing account (e.g., the admin).\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Lack of email uniqueness validation during account creation.\n*   CWE-287: Improper Authentication\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   Potential privilege escalation.\n*   Account takeover.\n*   Account identification issues.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Authenticated users (reseller, customer) can exploit the vulnerability.\n*   Email-based: The system allows multiple accounts with the same email address.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   Authenticated user (e.g., reseller, customer).\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   The commit `a43d53d` forces admin email addresses to be unique and prevents customers from using the same email. This fixes GHSA-7j6w-p859-464f (which is CVE-2025-29773).\n*   Patched versions: 2.2.6 (Affected versions: 2.2.5)\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   A Proof of Concept (PoC) video is available: <https://mega.nz/file/h8oFHQrL#I4V02_BWee4CCx7OoBl_2Ufkd5Wc7fvs5aCatGApkoQ>\n*   CVSS score: 5.8 (Moderate)\n*   CVSS v3 base metrics: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N\n*   The vulnerability was reported by halas98.",

While CWE-306 is a strong candidate, CWE-287 is a higher-level class that encompasses the scenario where the authentication mechanism is flawed, leading to improper authentication, rather than a complete absence of authentication.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    \n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe287 primary\n    class cwe306 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **failure to enforce unique email addresses** during account creation. This **weakness** allows authenticated users to create accounts with the same email as existing accounts, leading to **Improper Authentication** (CWE-287) or potentially a **Missing Authentication for Critical Function** (CWE-306) in certain scenarios, and finally, **account identification issues** and other security problems.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment considered several CWEs, especially those related to authentication and authorization. The primary focus was on identifying the root cause, which is the **failure to prevent multiple accounts from registering the same email address**.\n\nThe evidence supporting the selection of CWE-287 [CWE-287: Improper Authentication] is derived from the following phrases: \"users (such as resellers or customers) are able to create accounts with the same email address as an existing account,\" and \"does not prevent multiple accounts from registering the same email address\". This indicates that the system's authentication process is flawed, allowing for potential bypass or confusion due to the non-unique email addresses.\n\nThe graph relationships indicate that CWE-306 [CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function] is a child of CWE-287 [CWE-287: Improper Authentication]. This suggests that if the authentication mechanism is present but flawed (improper), it falls under CWE-287, whereas if it's completely absent for a critical function, it falls under CWE-306. In this case, the authentication exists but is undermined by the lack of unique email validation, making CWE-287 the more appropriate choice as the primary CWE. CWE-306 is still a viable secondary consideration because depending on how the application handles authentication, the **lack of email uniqueness** *could* lead to critical functions being accessed without proper authentication.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately represent the core issue (flawed authentication process due to lack of unique email validation) and a potential consequence (missing authentication for critical functions).\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially
