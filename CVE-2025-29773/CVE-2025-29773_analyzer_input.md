# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-29773

## Vulnerability Description
Froxlor is open-source server administration software. A vulnerability in versions prior to 2.2.6 allows users (such as resellers or customers) to create accounts with the same email address as an existing account. This creates potential issues with account identification and security. This vulnerability can be exploited by authenticated users (e.g., reseller, customer) who can create accounts with the same email address that has already been used by another account, such as the admin. The attack vector is email-based, as the system **does not prevent multiple accounts from registering the same email address**, leading to possible conflicts and security issues. Version 2.2.6 fixes the issue.
