Some CMS (Content Management Systems) also use templates.\n\n\nTemplate engines often have their own custom command or expression language. If an attacker can influence input into a template before it is processed, then the attacker can invoke arbitrary expressions, i.e. perform injection attacks. For example, in some template languages, an attacker could inject the expression \"{{7*7}}\" and determine if the output returns \"49\" instead. The syntax varies depending on the language.\n\n\nIn some cases, XSS-style attacks can work, which can obscure the root cause if the developer does not closely investigate the root cause of the error.\n\n\nTemplate engines can be used on the server or client, so both \"sides\" could be affected by injection. The mechanisms of attack or the affected technologies might be different, but the mistake is fundamentally the same.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2024-34359: Chain: Python bindings for LLM library do not use a sandboxed environment when parsing a template and constructing a prompt, allowing jinja2 Server Side Template Injection and code execution - one variant of a \"prompt injection\" attack.\n\n- CVE-2017-16783: server-side template injection in content management server\n\n- CVE-2020-9437: authentication / identity management product has client-side template injection\n\n- CVE-2020-12790: Server-Side Template Injection using a Twig template\n\n- CVE-2021-21244: devops platform allows SSTI\n\n- CVE-2020-4027: bypass of Server-Side Template Injection protection mechanism with macros in Velocity templates\n\n- CVE-2020-26282: web browser proxy server allows Java EL expressions from Server-Side Template Injection\n\n- CVE-2020-1961: SSTI involving mail templates and JEXL expressions\n\n- CVE-2019-19999: product does not use a \"safe\" setting for a FreeMarker configuration, allowing SSTI\n\n- CVE-2018-20465: product allows read of sensitive database username/password variables using server-side template injection\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-25283: An issue was discovered in through SaltStack Salt before 3002.5.

The issue was patched and a new version was released. Please upgrade to version 9.1.6. There are no known workarounds known.\n\n- CVE-2021-43466: In the thymeleaf-spring5:3.0.12 component, thymeleaf combined with specific scenarios in template injection may lead to remote code execution.\n\n- CVE-2021-32817: express-hbs is an Express handlebars template engine. express-hbs mixes pure template data with engine configuration options through the Express render API. More specifically, the layout parameter may trigger file disclosure vulnerabilities in downstream applications. This potential vulnerability is somewhat restricted in that only files with existing extentions (i.e. file.extension) can be included, files that lack an extension will have .hbs appended to them. For complete details refer to the referenced GHSL-2021-019 report. Notes in documentation have been added to help users of express-hbs avoid this potential information exposure vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2021-32820: Express-handlebars is a Handlebars view engine for Express. Express-handlebars mixes pure template data with engine configuration options through the Express render API. More specifically, the layout parameter may trigger file disclosure vulnerabilities in downstream applications. This potential vulnerability is somewhat restricted in that only files with existing extentions (i.e. file.extension) can be included, files that lack an extension will have .handlebars appended to them.

For an example PoC see the referenced GHSL-2021-020.\n\n- CVE-2021-29454: Smarty is a template engine for PHP, facilitating the separation of presentation (HTML/CSS) from application logic. Prior to versions 3.1.42 and 4.0.2, template authors could run arbitrary PHP code by crafting a malicious math string. If a math string was passed through as user provided data to the math function, external users could run arbitrary PHP code by crafting a malicious math string. Users should upgrade to version 3.1.42 or 4.0.2 to receive a patch.\n\n- CVE-2021-32649: October CMS is a self-hosted content management system (CMS) platform based on the Laravel PHP Framework. Prior to versions 1.0.473 and 1.1.6, an attacker with \"create, modify and delete website pages\" privileges in the backend is able to execute PHP code by running specially crafted Twig code in the template markup. The issue has been patched in Build 473 (v1.0.473) and v1.1.6. Those unable to upgrade may apply the patch to their installation manually as a workaround.\n\n- CVE-2021-43097: A Server-side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerability exists in bbs 5.3 in TemplateManageAction.javawhich could let a malicoius user execute arbitrary code.\n\n- CVE-2021-43837: vault-cli is a configurable command-line interface tool (and python library) to interact with Hashicorp Vault. In versions before 3.0.0 vault-cli features the ability for rendering templated values. When a secret starts with the prefix `!template!`, vault-cli interprets the rest of the contents of the secret as a Jinja2 template. Jinja2 is a powerful templating engine and is not designed to safely render arbitrary templates. An attacker controlling a jinja2 template rendered on a machine can trigger arbitrary code, making this a Remote Code Execution (RCE) risk. If the content of the vault can be completely trusted, then this is not a problem. Otherwise, if your threat model includes cases where an attacker can manipulate a secret value read from the vault using vault-cli, then this vulnerability may impact you. In 3.0.0, the code related to interpreting vault templated secrets has been removed entirely. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. For users unable to upgrade a workaround does exist. Using the environment variable `VAULT_CLI_RENDER=false` or the flag `--no-render` (placed between `vault-cli` and the subcommand, e.g. `vault-cli --no-render get-all`) or adding `render: false` to the vault-cli configuration yaml file disables rendering and removes the vulnerability. Using the python library, you can use: `vault_cli.get_client(render=False)` when creating your client to get a client that will not render templated secrets and thus operates securely.\n\n- CVE-2021-46063: MCMS v5.2.5 was discovered to contain a Server Side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerability via the Template Management module.\n\n- CVE-2021-40219: Bolt CMS <= 4.2 is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution.

A single bank account number can be extracted with <200 requests, a password hash can be extracted with ~1200 requests, all within a few minutes. The problem has been patched in commit d22916275c51500b4004933ff1b0a69bc807b2b7. In order to work around this issue, you can also cherry pick that patch, however it will not work without the Rails 5.0 migration that was done in #150, which in turn had quite a few pull requests it depended on.\n\n- CVE-2021-3958: Improper Handling of Parameters vulnerability in Ipack Automation Systems Ipack SCADA Software allows : Blind SQL Injection.This issue affects Ipack SCADA Software: from unspecified before 1.1.0. \n\n- CVE-2021-42760: A improper neutralization of special elements used in an sql command ('sql injection') in Fortinet FortiWLM version 8.6.1 and below allows attacker to disclose sensitive information from DB tables via crafted requests.\n\n- CVE-2021-43077: A improper neutralization of special elements used in an sql command ('sql injection') in Fortinet FortiWLM version 8.6.2 and below, version 8.5.2 and below, version 8.4.2 and below, version 8.3.2 and below allows attacker to execute unauthorized code or commands via crafted HTTP requests to the AP monitor handlers.\n\n- CVE-2021-43925: Improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL command ('SQL Injection') vulnerability in Log Management functionality in Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM) before 7.0.1-42218-2 allows remote attackers to inject SQL commands via unspecified vectors.\n\n- CVE-2021-43926: Improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL command ('SQL Injection') vulnerability in Log Management functionality in Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM) before 7.0.1-42218-2 allows remote attackers to inject SQL commands via unspecified vectors.\n\n- CVE-2021-43927: Improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL command ('SQL Injection') vulnerability in Security Management functionality in Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM) before 7.0.1-42218-2 allows remote attackers to inject SQL commands via unspecified vectors.\n\n- CVE-2022-0224: dolibarr is vulnerable to Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command\n\n- CVE-2022-0258: pimcore is vulnerable to Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command\n\n- CVE-2022-1358: The affected On-Premise is vulnerable to data exfiltration through improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL command.

This issue has been patched in version 1.16.3. If users are unable to update they should disable the LDAP feature if in use.\n\n- CVE-2021-43350: An unauthenticated Apache Traffic Control Traffic Ops user can send a request with a specially-crafted username to the POST /login endpoint of any API version to inject unsanitized content into the LDAP filter.\n\n- CVE-2021-41276: Tuleap is a Libre and Open Source tool for end to end traceability of application and system developments. In affected versions Tuleap does not sanitize properly the search filter built from the ldap_id attribute of a user during the daily synchronization. A malicious user could force accounts to be suspended or take over another account by forcing the update of the ldap_uid attribute. Note that the malicious user either need to have site administrator capability on the Tuleap instance or be an LDAP operator with the capability to create/modify account. The Tuleap instance needs to have the LDAP plugin activated and enabled for this issue to be exploitable. This issue has been patched in Tuleap Community Edition 13.2.99.31, Tuleap Enterprise Edition 13.1-5, and Tuleap Enterprise Edition 13.2-3.\n\n- CVE-2021-43782: Tuleap is a Libre and Open Source tool for end to end traceability of application and system developments.

The following versions contain the fix: Tuleap Community Edition 13.2.99.83, Tuleap Enterprise Edition 13.1-6, and Tuleap Enterprise Edition 13.2-4.\n\n- CVE-2021-39031: IBM WebSphere Application Server - Liberty 17.0.0.3 through 22.0.0.1 could allow a remote authenticated attacker to conduct an LDAP injection. By using a specially crafted request, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability and could result in in granting permission to unauthorized resources. IBM X-Force ID: 213875.\n\n- CVE-2022-22360: IBM Sterling Partner Engagement Manager 6.1.2, 6.2, and Cloud/SasS 22.2 could allow a remote authenticated attacker to conduct an LDAP injection. By using a specially crafted request, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability and could result in in granting permission to unauthorized resources. IBM X-Force ID: 220782.\n\n- CVE-2022-45910: Improper neutralization of special elements used in an LDAP query ('LDAP Injection') vulnerability in ActiveDirectory and Sharepoint ActiveDirectory authority connectors of Apache ManifoldCF allows an attacker to manipulate the LDAP search queries (DoS, additional queries, filter manipulation) during user lookup, if the username or the domain string are passed to the UserACLs servlet without validation. This issue affects Apache ManifoldCF version 2.23 and prior versions.\n\n- CVE-2022-24832: GoCD is an open source a continuous delivery server. The bundled gocd-ldap-authentication-plugin included with the GoCD Server fails to correctly escape special characters when using the username to construct LDAP queries. While this does not directly allow arbitrary LDAP data exfiltration, it can allow an existing LDAP-authenticated GoCD user with malicious intent to construct and execute malicious queries, allowing them to deduce facts about other users or entries within the LDAP database (e.g alternate fields, usernames, hashed passwords etc) through brute force mechanisms. This only affects users who have a working LDAP authorization configuration enabled on their GoCD server, and only is exploitable by users authenticating using such an LDAP configuration. This issue has been fixed in GoCD 22.1.0, which is bundled with gocd-ldap-authentication-plugin v2.2.0-144.\n\n- CVE-2022-22975: An issue was discovered in the Pinniped Supervisor with either LADPIdentityProvider or ActiveDirectoryIdentityProvider resources. An attack would involve the malicious user changing the common name (CN) of their user entry on the LDAP or AD server to include special characters, which could be used to perform LDAP query injection on the Supervisor's LDAP query which determines their Kubernetes group membership.\n\n- CVE-2022-31088: LDAP Account Manager (LAM) is a webfrontend for managing entries (e.g. users, groups, DHCP settings) stored in an LDAP directory. In versions prior to 8.0 the user name field at login could be used to enumerate LDAP data. This is only the case for LDAP search configuration. This issue has been fixed in version 8.0.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-943 (ChildOf)",

These special elements can carry control implications. If product does not prevent external control or influence over the inclusion of such special elements, the control flow of the program may be altered from what was intended. For example, both Unix and Windows interpret the symbol < (\"less than\") as meaning \"read input from a file\".\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2001-0677: Read arbitrary files from mail client by providing a special MIME header that is internally used to store pathnames for attachments.\n\n- CVE-2000-0703: Setuid program does not cleanse special escape sequence before sending data to a mail program, causing the mail program to process those sequences.\n\n- CVE-2003-0020: Multi-channel issue.

Special characters in filename parameter can be the cause of bypassing code signing check function.\n\n- CVE-2022-0661: The Ad Injection WordPress plugin through 1.2.0.19 does not properly sanitize the body of the adverts injected into the pages, allowing a high privileged user (Admin+) to inject arbitrary HTML or javascript even with unfiltered_html disallowed, leading to a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Further it is also possible to inject PHP code, leading to a Remote Code execution (RCE) vulnerability, even if the DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT and DISALLOW_FILE_MOD constants are both set.\n\n- CVE-2022-35651: A stored XSS and blind SSRF vulnerability was found in Moodle, occurs due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied data in the SCORM track details. A remote attacker can trick the victim to follow a specially crafted link and execute arbitrary HTML and script code in user's browser in context of vulnerable website to steal potentially sensitive information, change appearance of the web page, can perform phishing and drive-by-download attacks.\n\n- CVE-2022-36325: Affected devices do not properly sanitize data introduced by an user when rendering the web interface. This could allow an authenticated remote attacker with administrative privileges to inject code and lead to a DOM-based XSS.\n\n- CVE-2022-4029: The Simple:Press plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the 'sforum_[md5 hash of the WordPress URL]' cookie value in versions up to, and including, 6.8 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link. This would be highly complex to exploit as it would require the attacker to set the cookie a cookie for the targeted user.\n\n- CVE-2022-24720: image_processing is an image processing wrapper for libvips and ImageMagick/GraphicsMagick. Prior to version 1.12.2, using the `#apply` method from image_processing to apply a series of operations that are coming from unsanitized user input allows the attacker to execute shell commands. This method is called internally by Active Storage variants, so Active Storage is vulnerable as well. The vulnerability has been fixed in version 1.12.2 of image_processing.

Symfony versions 4.1.0 before 4.4.35 and versions 5.0.0 before 5.3.12 are vulnerable to CSV injection, also known as formula injection. In Symfony 4.1, maintainers added the opt-in `csv_escape_formulas` option in the `CsvEncoder`, to prefix all cells starting with `=`, `+`, `-` or `@` with a tab `\\\\t`. Since then, OWASP added 2 chars in that list: Tab (0x09) and Carriage return (0x0D). This makes the previous prefix char (Tab `\\\\t`) part of the vulnerable characters, and OWASP suggests using the single quote `'` for prefixing the value. Starting with versions 4.4.34 and 5.3.12, Symfony now follows the OWASP recommendations and uses the single quote `'` to prefix formulas and add the prefix to cells starting by `\\\\t`, `\\\\r` as well as `=`, `+`, `-` and `@`.\n\n- CVE-2021-41390: In Ericsson ECM before 18.0, it was observed that Security Provider Endpoint in the User Profile Management Section is vulnerable to CSV Injection.\n\n- CVE-2021-24144: Unvalidated input in the Contact Form 7 Database Addon plugin, versions before 1.2.5.6, was prone to a vulnerability that lets remote attackers inject arbitrary formulas into CSV files.\n\n- CVE-2021-39022: IBM Guardium Data Encryption (GDE) 4.0.0.0 and 5.0.0.0 saves user-provided information into a Comma-Separated Value (CSV) file, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as a command when the file is opened by spreadsheet software.

It is the lack of verification of these assumptions for user-controlled input that leads to injection problems. Injection problems encompass a wide variety of issues -- all mitigated in very different ways and usually attempted in order to alter the control flow of the process. For this reason, the most effective way to discuss these weaknesses is to note the distinct features that classify them as injection weaknesses. The most important issue to note is that all injection problems share one thing in common -- i.e., they allow for the injection of control plane data into the user-controlled data plane. This means that the execution of the process may be altered by sending code in through legitimate data channels, using no other mechanism. While buffer overflows, and many other flaws, involve the use of some further issue to gain execution, injection problems need only for the data to be parsed.\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2024-5184: API service using a large generative AI model allows direct prompt injection to leak hard-coded system prompts or execute other prompts.\n\n- CVE-2022-36069: Python-based dependency management tool avoids OS command injection when generating Git commands but allows injection of optional arguments with input beginning with a dash (CWE-88), potentially allowing for code execution.\n\n- CVE-1999-0067: Canonical example of OS command injection.

But when the product logic depends on the order or number of entities, this can also lead to vulnerabilities. For example, if the query expects to return only one entity that specifies an administrative user, but an attacker can change which entities are returned, this could cause the logic to return information for a regular user and incorrectly assume that the user has administrative privileges.\n\nWhile this weakness is most commonly associated with SQL injection, there are many other query languages that are also subject to injection attacks, including HTSQL, LDAP, DQL, XQuery, Xpath, and \"NoSQL\" languages.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2014-2503: Injection using Documentum Query Language (DQL)\n\n- CVE-2014-2508: Injection using Documentum Query Language (DQL)\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-20736: NoSQL injection vulnerability in GROWI versions prior to v4.2.20 allows a remote attacker to obtain and/or alter the information stored in the database via unspecified vectors.\n\n- CVE-2021-22910: A sanitization vulnerability exists in Rocket.Chat server versions <3.13.2, <3.12.4, <3.11.4 that allowed queries to an endpoint which could result in a NoSQL injection, potentially leading to RCE.\n\n- CVE-2021-22911: A improper input sanitization vulnerability exists in Rocket.Chat server 3.11, 3.12 & 3.13 that could lead to unauthenticated NoSQL injection, resulting potentially in RCE.\n\n- CVE-2022-35246: A NoSQL-Injection information disclosure vulnerability vulnerability exists in Rocket.Chat <v5, <v4.8.2 and <v4.7.5 in the getS3FileUrl Meteor server method that can disclose arbitrary file upload URLs to users that should not be able to access.\n\n- CVE-2022-36084: cruddl is software for creating a GraphQL API for a database, using the GraphQL SDL to model a schema. If cruddl starting with version 1.1.0 and prior to versions 2.7.0 and 3.0.2 is used to generate a schema that uses `@flexSearchFulltext`, users of that schema may be able to inject arbitrary AQL queries that will be forwarded to and executed by ArangoDB. Schemas that do not use `@flexSearchFulltext` are not affected. The attacker needs to have `READ` permission to at least one root entity type that has `@flexSearchFulltext` enabled. The issue has been fixed in version 3.0.2 and in version 2.7.0 of cruddl. As a workaround, users can temporarily remove `@flexSearchFulltext` from their schemas.\n\n- CVE-2022-47909: Livestatus Query Language (LQL) injection in the AuthUser HTTP query header of Tribe29's Checkmk <= 2.1.0p11, Checkmk <= 2.0.0p28, and all versions of Checkmk 1.6.0 (EOL) allows an attacker to perform direct queries to the application's core from localhost.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-74 (ChildOf)",

Consequently, the component that receives the output will perform the wrong operations, or otherwise interpret the data incorrectly.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-41232: Chain: authentication routine in Go-based agile development product does not escape user name (CWE-116), allowing LDAP injection (CWE-90)\n\n- CVE-2008-4636: OS command injection in backup software using shell metacharacters in a filename; correct behavior would require that this filename could not be changed.\n\n- CVE-2008-0769: Web application does not set the charset when sending a page to a browser, allowing for XSS exploitation when a browser chooses an unexpected encoding.\n\n- CVE-2008-0005: Program does not set the charset when sending a page to a browser, allowing for XSS exploitation when a browser chooses an unexpected encoding.\n\n- CVE-2008-5573: SQL injection via password parameter; a strong password might contain \"&\"\n\n- CVE-2008-3773: Cross-site scripting in chat application via a message subject, which normally might contain \"&\" and other XSS-related characters.\n\n- CVE-2008-0757: Cross-site scripting in chat application via a message, which normally might be allowed to contain arbitrary content.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-20195: A flaw was found in keycloak in versions before 13.0.0. A Self Stored XSS attack vector escalating to a complete account takeover is possible due to user-supplied data fields not being properly encoded and Javascript code being used to process the data. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.\n\n- CVE-2021-21684: Jenkins Git Plugin 4.8.2 and earlier does not escape the Git SHA-1 checksum parameters provided to commit notifications when displaying them in a build cause, resulting in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2021-3148: An issue was discovered in SaltStack Salt before 3002.5. Sending crafted web requests to the Salt API can result in salt.utils.thin.gen_thin() command injection because of different handling of single versus double quotes. This is related to salt/utils/thin.py.\n\n- CVE-2021-32796: xmldom is an open source pure JavaScript W3C standard-based (XML DOM Level 2 Core) DOMParser and XMLSerializer module. xmldom versions 0.6.0 and older do not correctly escape special characters when serializing elements removed from their ancestor. This may lead to unexpected syntactic changes during XML processing in some downstream applications. This issue has been resolved in version 0.7.0. As a workaround downstream applications can validate the input and reject the maliciously crafted documents.\n\n- CVE-2021-30640: A vulnerability in the JNDI Realm of Apache Tomcat allows an attacker to authenticate using variations of a valid user name and/or to bypass some of the protection provided by the LockOut Realm. This issue affects Apache Tomcat 10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.5; 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.45; 8.5.0 to 8.5.65.\n\n- CVE-2020-27958: The Job Composer app in Ohio Supercomputer Center Open OnDemand before 1.7.19 and 1.8.x before 1.8.18 allows remote authenticated users to provide crafted input in a job template.\n\n- CVE-2021-44042: An issue was discovered in UiPath Assistant 21.4.4. User-controlled data supplied to the --process-start argument of the URI handler for uipath-assistant:// is not correctly encoded, resulting in attacker-controlled content being injected into the error message displayed (when the injected content does not match an existing process). A determined attacker could leverage this to execute JavaScript in the context of the Electron application.\n\n- CVE-2022-0210: The Random Banner WordPress plugin is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting due to insufficient escaping via the category parameter found in the ~/include/models/model.php file which allowed attackers with administrative user access to inject arbitrary web scripts, in versions up to and including 4.1.4. This affects multi-site installations where unfiltered_html is disabled for administrators, and sites where unfiltered_html is disabled.\n\n- CVE-2022-0220: The check_privacy_settings AJAX action of the WordPress GDPR WordPress plugin before 1.9.27, available to both unauthenticated and authenticated users, responds with JSON data without an \"application/json\" content-type. Since an HTML payload isn't properly escaped, it may be interpreted by a web browser led to this endpoint. Javascript code may be executed on a victim's browser. Due to v1.9.26 adding a CSRF check, the XSS is only exploitable against unauthenticated users (as they all share the same nonce)\n\n- CVE-2022-0479: The Popup Builder WordPress plugin before 4.1.1 does not sanitise and escape the sgpb-subscription-popup-id parameter before using it in a SQL statement in the All Subscribers admin dashboard, leading to a SQL injection, which could also be used to perform Reflected Cross-Site Scripting attack against a logged in admin opening a malicious link\n\n- CVE-2022-1407: The VikBooking Hotel Booking Engine & PMS WordPress plugin before 1.5.8 does not have CSRF check in place when adding a tracking campaign, and does not escape the campaign fields when outputting them In attributes. As a result, attackers could make a logged in admin add tracking campaign with XSS payloads in them via a CSRF attack\n\n- CVE-2022-2099: The WooCommerce WordPress plugin before 6.6.0 is vulnerable to stored HTML injection due to lack of escaping and sanitizing in the payment gateway titles\n\n- CVE-2022-2241: The Featured Image from URL (FIFU) WordPress plugin before 4.0.1 does not have CSRF check in place when updating its settings, which could allow attackers to make a logged in admin change them via a CSRF attack. Furthermore, due to the lack of validation, sanitisation and escaping in some of them, it could also lead to Stored XSS issues\n\n- CVE-2022-22734: The Simple Quotation WordPress plugin through 1.3.2 does not have CSRF check when creating or editing a quote and does not sanitise and escape Quotes. As a result, attacker could make a logged in admin create or edit arbitrary quote, and put Cross-Site Scripting payloads in them\n\n- CVE-2022-23603: iTunesRPC-Remastered is a discord rich presence application for use with iTunes & Apple Music. In code before commit 24f43aa user input is not properly sanitized and code injection is possible. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as is possible. There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-23620: XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. In affected versions AbstractSxExportURLFactoryActionHandler#processSx does not escape anything from SSX document references when serializing it on filesystem, it is possible to for the HTML export process to contain reference elements containing filesystem syntax like \"../\", \"./\". or \"/\" in general. The referenced elements are not properly escaped. This issue has been resolved in version 13.6-rc-1. This issue can be worked around by limiting or disabling document export.\n\n- CVE-2022-30966: Jenkins Random String Parameter Plugin 1.0 and earlier does not escape the name and description of Random String parameters on views displaying parameters, resulting in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers with Item/Configure permission.\n\n- CVE-2022-48339: An issue was discovered in GNU Emacs through 28.2. htmlfontify.el has a command injection vulnerability. In the hfy-istext-command function, the parameter file and parameter srcdir come from external input, and parameters are not escaped. If a file name or directory name contains shell metacharacters, code may be executed.\n\n- CVE-2022-24682: An issue was discovered in the Calendar feature in Zimbra Collaboration Suite 8.8.x before 8.8.15 patch 30 (update 1), as exploited in the wild starting in December 2021. An attacker could place HTML containing executable JavaScript inside element attributes. This markup becomes unescaped, causing arbitrary markup to be injected into the document.\n\n- CVE-2022-42948: Cobalt Strike 4.7.1 fails to properly escape HTML tags when they are displayed on Swing components. By injecting crafted HTML code, it is possible to remotely execute code in the Cobalt Strike UI.\n\n- CVE-2021-39027: IBM Guardium Data Encryption (GDE) 4.0.0 and 5.0.0 prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved. IBM X-Force ID: 213865.\n\n- CVE-2022-41934: XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. Any user with view rights on commonly accessible documents including the menu macro can execute arbitrary Groovy, Python or Velocity code in XWiki leading to full access to the XWiki installation due to improper escaping of the macro content and parameters of the menu macro. The problem has been patched in XWiki 14.6RC1, 13.10.8 and 14.4.3. The patch (commit `2fc20891`) for the document `Menu.MenuMacro` can be manually applied or a XAR archive of a patched version can be imported. The menu macro was basically unchanged since XWiki 11.6 so on XWiki 11.6 or later the patch for version of 13.10.8 (commit `59ccca24a`) can most likely be applied, on XWiki version 14.0 and later the versions in XWiki 14.6 and 14.4.3 should be appropriate.\n\n- CVE-2022-45143: The JsonErrorReportValve in Apache Tomcat 8.5.83, 9.0.40 to 9.0.68 and 10.1.0-M1 to 10.1.1 did not escape the type, message or description values. In some circumstances these are constructed from user provided data and it was therefore possible for users to supply values that invalidated or manipulated the JSON output.\n\n- CVE-2022-28960: A PHP injection vulnerability in Spip before v3.2.8 allows attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via the _oups parameter at /ecrire.\n\n- CVE-2022-36099: XWiki Platform Wiki UI Main Wiki is software for managing subwikis on XWiki Platform, a generic wiki platform. Starting with version 5.3-milestone-2 and prior to versions 13.10.6 and 14.4, it's possible to inject arbitrary wiki syntax including Groovy, Python and Velocity script macros via the request (URL parameter) using the `XWikiServerClassSheet` if the user has view access to this sheet and another page that has been saved with programming rights, a standard condition on a public read-only XWiki installation or a private XWiki installation where the user has an account. This allows arbitrary Groovy/Python/Velocity code execution which allows bypassing all rights checks and thus both modification and disclosure of all content stored in the XWiki installation. Also, this could be used to impact the availability of the wiki. This has been patched in versions 13.10.6 and 14.4. As a workaround, edit the affected document `XWiki.XWikiServerClassSheet` or `WikiManager.XWikiServerClassSheet` and manually perform the changes from the patch fixing the issue. On XWiki versions 12.0 and later, it is also possible to import the document `XWiki.XWikiServerClassSheet` from the xwiki-platform-wiki-ui-mainwiki package version 14.4 using the import feature of the administration application as there have been no other changes to this document since XWiki 12.0.\n\n- CVE-2022-36100: XWiki Platform Applications Tag and XWiki Platform Tag UI are tag applications for XWiki, a generic wiki platform. Starting with version 1.7 in XWiki Platform Applications Tag and prior to 13.10.6 and 14.4 in XWiki Platform Tag UI, the tags document `Main.Tags` in XWiki didn't sanitize user inputs properly. This allowed users with view rights on the document (default in a public wiki or for authenticated users on private wikis) to execute arbitrary Groovy, Python and Velocity code with programming rights. This also allowed bypassing all rights checks and thus both modification and disclosure of all content stored in the XWiki installation. The vulnerability could be used to impact the availability of the wiki. On XWiki versions before 13.10.4 and 14.2, this can be combined with CVE-2022-36092, meaning that no rights are required to perform the attack. The vulnerability has been patched in versions 13.10.6 and 14.4. As a workaround, the patch that fixes the issue can be manually applied to the document `Main.Tags` or the updated version of that document can be imported from version 14.4 of xwiki-platform-tag-ui using the import feature in the administration UI on XWiki 10.9 and later.\n\n- CVE-2022-22744: The constructed curl command from the \"Copy as curl\" feature in DevTools was not properly escaped for PowerShell. This could have lead to command injection if pasted into a Powershell prompt.<br>*This bug only affects Thunderbird for Windows. Other operating systems are unaffected.*.

The CWE usage of \"access control\" is intended as a general term for the various mechanisms that restrict which users can access which resources, and \"authorization\" is more narrowly defined. It is unlikely that there will be community consensus on the use of these terms.\n\nDescription:\n\nThe product does not restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor.\n\nExtended Details:\n\n\n\nAccess control involves the use of several protection mechanisms such as:\n\n\n  - Authentication (proving the identity of an actor)\n\n  - Authorization (ensuring that a given actor can access a resource), and\n\n  - Accountability (tracking of activities that were performed)\n\nWhen any mechanism is not applied or otherwise fails, attackers can compromise the security of the product by gaining privileges, reading sensitive information, executing commands, evading detection, etc.\n\nThere are two distinct behaviors that can introduce access control weaknesses:\n\n\n  - Specification: incorrect privileges, permissions, ownership, etc. are explicitly specified for either the user or the resource (for example, setting a password file to be world-writable, or giving administrator capabilities to a guest user). This action could be performed by the program or the administrator.\n\n  - Enforcement: the mechanism contains errors that prevent it from properly enforcing the specified access control requirements (e.g., allowing the user to specify their own privileges, or allowing a syntactically-incorrect ACL to produce insecure settings). This problem occurs within the program itself, in that it does not actually enforce the intended security policy that the administrator specifies.\n\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-24985: A form hosting website only checks the session authentication status for a single form, making it possible to bypass authentication when there are multiple forms\n\n- CVE-2022-29238: Access-control setting in web-based document collaboration tool is not properly implemented by the code, which prevents listing hidden directories but does not prevent direct requests to files in those directories.\n\n- CVE-2022-23607: Python-based HTTP library did not scope cookies to a particular domain such that \"supercookies\" could be sent to any domain on redirect\n\n- CVE-2021-21972: Chain: Cloud computing virtualization platform does not require authentication for upload of a tar format file (CWE-306), then uses .. path traversal sequences (CWE-23) in the file to access unexpected files, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2021-37415: IT management product does not perform authentication for some REST API requests, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2021-35033: Firmware for a WiFi router uses a hard-coded password for a BusyBox shell, allowing bypass of authentication through the UART port\n\n- CVE-2020-10263: Bluetooth speaker does not require authentication for the debug functionality on the UART port, allowing root shell access\n\n- CVE-2020-13927: Default setting in workflow management product allows all API requests without authentication, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2010-4624: Bulletin board applies restrictions on number of images during post creation, but does not enforce this on editing.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-1581: Multiple vulnerabilities in the web UI and API endpoints of Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) or Cisco Cloud APIC could allow a remote attacker to perform a command injection or file upload attack on an affected system.

Some CMS (Content Management Systems) also use templates.\n\n\nTemplate engines often have their own custom command or expression language. If an attacker can influence input into a template before it is processed, then the attacker can invoke arbitrary expressions, i.e. perform injection attacks. For example, in some template languages, an attacker could inject the expression \"{{7*7}}\" and determine if the output returns \"49\" instead. The syntax varies depending on the language.\n\n\nIn some cases, XSS-style attacks can work, which can obscure the root cause if the developer does not closely investigate the root cause of the error.\n\n\nTemplate engines can be used on the server or client, so both \"sides\" could be affected by injection. The mechanisms of attack or the affected technologies might be different, but the mistake is fundamentally the same.\n",

Some CMS (Content Management Systems) also use templates.\n\n\nTemplate engines often have their own custom command or expression language. If an attacker can influence input into a template before it is processed, then the attacker can invoke arbitrary expressions, i.e. perform injection attacks. For example, in some template languages, an attacker could inject the expression \"{{7*7}}\" and determine if the output returns \"49\" instead. The syntax varies depending on the language.\n\n\nIn some cases, XSS-style attacks can work, which can obscure the root cause if the developer does not closely investigate the root cause of the error.\n\n\nTemplate engines can be used on the server or client, so both \"sides\" could be affected by injection. The mechanisms of attack or the affected technologies might be different, but the mistake is fundamentally the same.\n",

Some CMS (Content Management Systems) also use templates.\n\n\nTemplate engines often have their own custom command or expression language. If an attacker can influence input into a template before it is processed, then the attacker can invoke arbitrary expressions, i.e. perform injection attacks. For example, in some template languages, an attacker could inject the expression \"{{7*7}}\" and determine if the output returns \"49\" instead. The syntax varies depending on the language.\n\n\nIn some cases, XSS-style attacks can work, which can obscure the root cause if the developer does not closely investigate the root cause of the error.\n\n\nTemplate engines can be used on the server or client, so both \"sides\" could be affected by injection. The mechanisms of attack or the affected technologies might be different, but the mistake is fundamentally the same.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2024-34359: Chain: Python bindings for LLM library do not use a sandboxed environment when parsing a template and constructing a prompt, allowing jinja2 Server Side Template Injection and code execution - one variant of a \"prompt injection\" attack.\n\n- CVE-2017-16783: server-side template injection in content management server\n\n- CVE-2020-9437: authentication / identity management product has client-side template injection\n\n- CVE-2020-12790: Server-Side Template Injection using a Twig template\n\n- CVE-2021-21244: devops platform allows SSTI\n\n- CVE-2020-4027: bypass of Server-Side Template Injection protection mechanism with macros in Velocity templates\n\n- CVE-2020-26282: web browser proxy server allows Java EL expressions from Server-Side Template Injection\n\n- CVE-2020-1961: SSTI involving mail templates and JEXL expressions\n\n- CVE-2019-19999: product does not use a \"safe\" setting for a FreeMarker configuration, allowing SSTI\n\n- CVE-2018-20465: product allows read of sensitive database username/password variables using server-side template injection\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-25283: An issue was discovered in through SaltStack Salt before 3002.5.

A vulnerability has been found in the code that allows any user to access sensible informations by setting up a specific template which is not properly sanitized. The problem has been patched in version 1.3.18. Users should update and type `!warnsysteminfo` to check that their version is 1.3.18 or above. As a workaround users may unload the WarnSystem cog or disable the `!warnset description` command globally.\n\n- CVE-2021-30214: Knowage Suite 7.3 is vulnerable to Stored Client-Side Template Injection in '/knowage/restful-services/signup/update' via the 'name' parameter.\n\n- CVE-2021-35450: A Server Side Template Injection in the Entando Admin Console 6.3.9 and before allows a user with privileges to execute FreeMarker template with command execution via freemarker.template.utility.Execute\n\n- CVE-2021-39128: Affected versions of Atlassian Jira Server or Data Center using the Jira Service Management addon allow remote attackers with JIRA Administrators access to execute arbitrary Java code via a server-side template injection vulnerability in the Email Template feature. The affected versions of Jira Server or Data Center are before version 8.13.12, and from version 8.14.0 before 8.19.1.\n\n- CVE-2021-23337: Lodash versions prior to 4.17.21 are vulnerable to Command Injection via the template function.\n\n- CVE-2021-3583: A flaw was found in Ansible, where a user's controller is vulnerable to template injection. This issue can occur through facts used in the template if the user is trying to put templates in multi-line YAML strings and the facts being handled do not routinely include special template characters. This flaw allows attackers to perform command injection, which discloses sensitive information. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality and integrity.\n\n- CVE-2021-22053: Applications using both `spring-cloud-netflix-hystrix-dashboard` and `spring-boot-starter-thymeleaf` expose a way to execute code submitted within the request URI path during the resolution of view templates.

The issue was patched and a new version was released. Please upgrade to version 9.1.6. There are no known workarounds known.\n\n- CVE-2021-43466: In the thymeleaf-spring5:3.0.12 component, thymeleaf combined with specific scenarios in template injection may lead to remote code execution.\n\n- CVE-2021-32817: express-hbs is an Express handlebars template engine. express-hbs mixes pure template data with engine configuration options through the Express render API. More specifically, the layout parameter may trigger file disclosure vulnerabilities in downstream applications. This potential vulnerability is somewhat restricted in that only files with existing extentions (i.e. file.extension) can be included, files that lack an extension will have .hbs appended to them. For complete details refer to the referenced GHSL-2021-019 report. Notes in documentation have been added to help users of express-hbs avoid this potential information exposure vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2021-32820: Express-handlebars is a Handlebars view engine for Express. Express-handlebars mixes pure template data with engine configuration options through the Express render API. More specifically, the layout parameter may trigger file disclosure vulnerabilities in downstream applications. This potential vulnerability is somewhat restricted in that only files with existing extentions (i.e. file.extension) can be included, files that lack an extension will have .handlebars appended to them. For complete details refer to the referenced GHSL-2021-018 report. Notes in documentation have been added to help users avoid this potential information exposure vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2021-32822: The npm hbs package is an Express view engine wrapper for Handlebars. Depending on usage, users of hbs may be vulnerable to a file disclosure vulnerability. There is currently no patch for this vulnerability. hbs mixes pure template data with engine configuration options through the Express render API. By overwriting internal configuration options a file disclosure vulnerability may be triggered in downstream applications. For an example PoC see the referenced GHSL-2021-020.\n\n- CVE-2021-29454: Smarty is a template engine for PHP, facilitating the separation of presentation (HTML/CSS) from application logic. Prior to versions 3.1.42 and 4.0.2, template authors could run arbitrary PHP code by crafting a malicious math string. If a math string was passed through as user provided data to the math function, external users could run arbitrary PHP code by crafting a malicious math string. Users should upgrade to version 3.1.42 or 4.0.2 to receive a patch.\n\n- CVE-2021-32649: October CMS is a self-hosted content management system (CMS) platform based on the Laravel PHP Framework. Prior to versions 1.0.473 and 1.1.6, an attacker with \"create, modify and delete website pages\" privileges in the backend is able to execute PHP code by running specially crafted Twig code in the template markup. The issue has been patched in Build 473 (v1.0.473) and v1.1.6. Those unable to upgrade may apply the patch to their installation manually as a workaround.\n\n- CVE-2021-43097: A Server-side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerability exists in bbs 5.3 in TemplateManageAction.javawhich could let a malicoius user execute arbitrary code.\n\n- CVE-2021-43837: vault-cli is a configurable command-line interface tool (and python library) to interact with Hashicorp Vault. In versions before 3.0.0 vault-cli features the ability for rendering templated values. When a secret starts with the prefix `!template!`, vault-cli interprets the rest of the contents of the secret as a Jinja2 template. Jinja2 is a powerful templating engine and is not designed to safely render arbitrary templates. An attacker controlling a jinja2 template rendered on a machine can trigger arbitrary code, making this a Remote Code Execution (RCE) risk. If the content of the vault can be completely trusted, then this is not a problem. Otherwise, if your threat model includes cases where an attacker can manipulate a secret value read from the vault using vault-cli, then this vulnerability may impact you. In 3.0.0, the code related to interpreting vault templated secrets has been removed entirely. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. For users unable to upgrade a workaround does exist. Using the environment variable `VAULT_CLI_RENDER=false` or the flag `--no-render` (placed between `vault-cli` and the subcommand, e.g. `vault-cli --no-render get-all`) or adding `render: false` to the vault-cli configuration yaml file disables rendering and removes the vulnerability. Using the python library, you can use: `vault_cli.get_client(render=False)` when creating your client to get a client that will not render templated secrets and thus operates securely.\n\n- CVE-2021-46063: MCMS v5.2.5 was discovered to contain a Server Side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerability via the Template Management module.\n\n- CVE-2021-40219: Bolt CMS <= 4.2 is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution.

If users are unable to update they should disable the LDAP feature if in use.\n\n- CVE-2021-43350: An unauthenticated Apache Traffic Control Traffic Ops user can send a request with a specially-crafted username to the POST /login endpoint of any API version to inject unsanitized content into the LDAP filter.\n\n- CVE-2021-41276: Tuleap is a Libre and Open Source tool for end to end traceability of application and system developments. In affected versions Tuleap does not sanitize properly the search filter built from the ldap_id attribute of a user during the daily synchronization. A malicious user could force accounts to be suspended or take over another account by forcing the update of the ldap_uid attribute. Note that the malicious user either need to have site administrator capability on the Tuleap instance or be an LDAP operator with the capability to create/modify account. The Tuleap instance needs to have the LDAP plugin activated and enabled for this issue to be exploitable. This issue has been patched in Tuleap Community Edition 13.2.99.31, Tuleap Enterprise Edition 13.1-5, and Tuleap Enterprise Edition 13.2-3.\n\n- CVE-2021-43782: Tuleap is a Libre and Open Source tool for end to end traceability of application and system developments. This is a follow up to GHSA-887w-pv2r-x8pm/CVE-2021-41276, the initial fix was incomplete. Tuleap does not sanitize properly the search filter built from the ldap_id attribute of a user during the daily synchronization. A malicious user could force accounts to be suspended or take over another account by forcing the update of the ldap_uid attribute. Note that the malicious user either need to have site administrator capability on the Tuleap instance or be an LDAP operator with the capability to create/modify account. The Tuleap instance needs to have the LDAP plugin activated and enabled for this issue to be exploitable. The following versions contain the fix: Tuleap Community Edition 13.2.99.83, Tuleap Enterprise Edition 13.1-6, and Tuleap Enterprise Edition 13.2-4.\n\n- CVE-2021-39031: IBM WebSphere Application Server - Liberty 17.0.0.3 through 22.0.0.1 could allow a remote authenticated attacker to conduct an LDAP injection. By using a specially crafted request, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability and could result in in granting permission to unauthorized resources. IBM X-Force ID: 213875.\n\n- CVE-2022-22360: IBM Sterling Partner Engagement Manager 6.1.2, 6.2, and Cloud/SasS 22.2 could allow a remote authenticated attacker to conduct an LDAP injection. By using a specially crafted request, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability and could result in in granting permission to unauthorized resources. IBM X-Force ID: 220782.\n\n- CVE-2022-45910: Improper neutralization of special elements used in an LDAP query ('LDAP Injection') vulnerability in ActiveDirectory and Sharepoint ActiveDirectory authority connectors of Apache ManifoldCF allows an attacker to manipulate the LDAP search queries (DoS, additional queries, filter manipulation) during user lookup, if the username or the domain string are passed to the UserACLs servlet without validation. This issue affects Apache ManifoldCF version 2.23 and prior versions.\n\n- CVE-2022-24832: GoCD is an open source a continuous delivery server. The bundled gocd-ldap-authentication-plugin included with the GoCD Server fails to correctly escape special characters when using the username to construct LDAP queries. While this does not directly allow arbitrary LDAP data exfiltration, it can allow an existing LDAP-authenticated GoCD user with malicious intent to construct and execute malicious queries, allowing them to deduce facts about other users or entries within the LDAP database (e.g alternate fields, usernames, hashed passwords etc) through brute force mechanisms. This only affects users who have a working LDAP authorization configuration enabled on their GoCD server, and only is exploitable by users authenticating using such an LDAP configuration. This issue has been fixed in GoCD 22.1.0, which is bundled with gocd-ldap-authentication-plugin v2.2.0-144.\n\n- CVE-2022-22975: An issue was discovered in the Pinniped Supervisor with either LADPIdentityProvider or ActiveDirectoryIdentityProvider resources. An attack would involve the malicious user changing the common name (CN) of their user entry on the LDAP or AD server to include special characters, which could be used to perform LDAP query injection on the Supervisor's LDAP query which determines their Kubernetes group membership.\n\n- CVE-2022-31088: LDAP Account Manager (LAM) is a webfrontend for managing entries (e.g. users, groups, DHCP settings) stored in an LDAP directory. In versions prior to 8.0 the user name field at login could be used to enumerate LDAP data. This is only the case for LDAP search configuration. This issue has been fixed in version 8.0.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-943 (ChildOf)",

These special elements can carry control implications. If product does not prevent external control or influence over the inclusion of such special elements, the control flow of the program may be altered from what was intended. For example, both Unix and Windows interpret the symbol < (\"less than\") as meaning \"read input from a file\".\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2001-0677: Read arbitrary files from mail client by providing a special MIME header that is internally used to store pathnames for attachments.\n\n- CVE-2000-0703: Setuid program does not cleanse special escape sequence before sending data to a mail program, causing the mail program to process those sequences.\n\n- CVE-2003-0020: Multi-channel issue. Terminal escape sequences not filtered from log files.\n\n- CVE-2003-0083: Multi-channel issue. Terminal escape sequences not filtered from log files.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-33592: NAVER Toolbar before 4.0.30.323 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted upgrade.xml file. Special characters in filename parameter can be the cause of bypassing code signing check function.\n\n- CVE-2022-0661: The Ad Injection WordPress plugin through 1.2.0.19 does not properly sanitize the body of the adverts injected into the pages, allowing a high privileged user (Admin+) to inject arbitrary HTML or javascript even with unfiltered_html disallowed, leading to a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Further it is also possible to inject PHP code, leading to a Remote Code execution (RCE) vulnerability, even if the DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT and DISALLOW_FILE_MOD constants are both set.\n\n- CVE-2022-35651: A stored XSS and blind SSRF vulnerability was found in Moodle, occurs due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied data in the SCORM track details. A remote attacker can trick the victim to follow a specially crafted link and execute arbitrary HTML and script code in user's browser in context of vulnerable website to steal potentially sensitive information, change appearance of the web page, can perform phishing and drive-by-download attacks.\n\n- CVE-2022-36325: Affected devices do not properly sanitize data introduced by an user when rendering the web interface. This could allow an authenticated remote attacker with administrative privileges to inject code and lead to a DOM-based XSS.\n\n- CVE-2022-4029: The Simple:Press plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the 'sforum_[md5 hash of the WordPress URL]' cookie value in versions up to, and including, 6.8 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link. This would be highly complex to exploit as it would require the attacker to set the cookie a cookie for the targeted user.\n\n- CVE-2022-24720: image_processing is an image processing wrapper for libvips and ImageMagick/GraphicsMagick. Prior to version 1.12.2, using the `#apply` method from image_processing to apply a series of operations that are coming from unsanitized user input allows the attacker to execute shell commands. This method is called internally by Active Storage variants, so Active Storage is vulnerable as well. The vulnerability has been fixed in version 1.12.2 of image_processing. As a workaround, users who process based on user input should always sanitize the user input by allowing only a constrained set of operations.\n\n- CVE-2021-25296: Nagios XI version xi-5.7.5 is affected by OS command injection. The vulnerability exists in the file /usr/local/nagiosxi/html/includes/configwizards/windowswmi/windowswmi.inc.php due to improper sanitization of authenticated user-controlled input by a single HTTP request, which can lead to OS command injection on the Nagios XI server.\n\n- CVE-2021-25297: Nagios XI version xi-5.7.5 is affected by OS command injection.

This data can be exported to a CSV file, which allows users to read the data using spreadsheet software such as Excel, Numbers, or Calc. This software interprets entries beginning with '=' as formulas, which are then executed by the spreadsheet software. The software's formula language often allows methods to access hyperlinks or the local command line, and frequently allows enough characters to invoke an entire script. Attackers can populate data fields which, when saved to a CSV file, may attempt information exfiltration or other malicious activity when automatically executed by the spreadsheet software.\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2019-12134: Low privileged user can trigger CSV injection through a contact form field value\n\n- CVE-2019-4521: Cloud management product allows arbitrary command execution via CSV injection\n\n- CVE-2019-17661: CSV injection in content management system via formula code in a first or last name\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-41128: Hygeia is an application for collecting and processing personal and case data in connection with communicable diseases. In affected versions all CSV Exports (Statistics & BAG MED) contain a CSV Injection Vulnerability. Users of the system are able to submit formula as exported fields which then get executed upon ingestion of the exported file. There is no validation or sanitization of these formula fields and so malicious may construct malicious code. This vulnerability has been resolved in version 1.30.4. There are no workarounds and all users are advised to upgrade their package.\n\n- CVE-2021-38873: IBM Planning Analytics 2.0 is potentially vulnerable to CSV Injection.

Symfony versions 4.1.0 before 4.4.35 and versions 5.0.0 before 5.3.12 are vulnerable to CSV injection, also known as formula injection. In Symfony 4.1, maintainers added the opt-in `csv_escape_formulas` option in the `CsvEncoder`, to prefix all cells starting with `=`, `+`, `-` or `@` with a tab `\\\\t`. Since then, OWASP added 2 chars in that list: Tab (0x09) and Carriage return (0x0D). This makes the previous prefix char (Tab `\\\\t`) part of the vulnerable characters, and OWASP suggests using the single quote `'` for prefixing the value. Starting with versions 4.4.34 and 5.3.12, Symfony now follows the OWASP recommendations and uses the single quote `'` to prefix formulas and add the prefix to cells starting by `\\\\t`, `\\\\r` as well as `=`, `+`, `-` and `@`.\n\n- CVE-2021-41390: In Ericsson ECM before 18.0, it was observed that Security Provider Endpoint in the User Profile Management Section is vulnerable to CSV Injection.\n\n- CVE-2021-24144: Unvalidated input in the Contact Form 7 Database Addon plugin, versions before 1.2.5.6, was prone to a vulnerability that lets remote attackers inject arbitrary formulas into CSV files.\n\n- CVE-2021-39022: IBM Guardium Data Encryption (GDE) 4.0.0.0 and 5.0.0.0 saves user-provided information into a Comma-Separated Value (CSV) file, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as a command when the file is opened by spreadsheet software.

It is the lack of verification of these assumptions for user-controlled input that leads to injection problems. Injection problems encompass a wide variety of issues -- all mitigated in very different ways and usually attempted in order to alter the control flow of the process. For this reason, the most effective way to discuss these weaknesses is to note the distinct features that classify them as injection weaknesses. The most important issue to note is that all injection problems share one thing in common -- i.e., they allow for the injection of control plane data into the user-controlled data plane. This means that the execution of the process may be altered by sending code in through legitimate data channels, using no other mechanism. While buffer overflows, and many other flaws, involve the use of some further issue to gain execution, injection problems need only for the data to be parsed.\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2024-5184: API service using a large generative AI model allows direct prompt injection to leak hard-coded system prompts or execute other prompts.\n\n- CVE-2022-36069: Python-based dependency management tool avoids OS command injection when generating Git commands but allows injection of optional arguments with input beginning with a dash (CWE-88), potentially allowing for code execution.\n\n- CVE-1999-0067: Canonical example of OS command injection.

Note: Software versions which have reached End of Technical Support (EoTS) are not evaluated.\n\n- CVE-2022-35954: The GitHub Actions ToolKit provides a set of packages to make creating actions easier. The `core.exportVariable` function uses a well known delimiter that attackers can use to break out of that specific variable and assign values to other arbitrary variables. Workflows that write untrusted values to the `GITHUB_ENV` file may cause the path or other environment variables to be modified without the intention of the workflow or action author. Users should upgrade to `@actions/core v1.9.1`. If you are unable to upgrade the `@actions/core` package, you can modify your action to ensure that any user input does not contain the delimiter `_GitHubActionsFileCommandDelimeter_` before calling `core.exportVariable`.\n\n- CVE-2022-46265: A vulnerability has been identified in Polarion ALM (All versions < V2304.0).

But when the product logic depends on the order or number of entities, this can also lead to vulnerabilities. For example, if the query expects to return only one entity that specifies an administrative user, but an attacker can change which entities are returned, this could cause the logic to return information for a regular user and incorrectly assume that the user has administrative privileges.\n\nWhile this weakness is most commonly associated with SQL injection, there are many other query languages that are also subject to injection attacks, including HTSQL, LDAP, DQL, XQuery, Xpath, and \"NoSQL\" languages.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2014-2503: Injection using Documentum Query Language (DQL)\n\n- CVE-2014-2508: Injection using Documentum Query Language (DQL)\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-20736: NoSQL injection vulnerability in GROWI versions prior to v4.2.20 allows a remote attacker to obtain and/or alter the information stored in the database via unspecified vectors.\n\n- CVE-2021-22910: A sanitization vulnerability exists in Rocket.Chat server versions <3.13.2, <3.12.4, <3.11.4 that allowed queries to an endpoint which could result in a NoSQL injection, potentially leading to RCE.\n\n- CVE-2021-22911: A improper input sanitization vulnerability exists in Rocket.Chat server 3.11, 3.12 & 3.13 that could lead to unauthenticated NoSQL injection, resulting potentially in RCE.\n\n- CVE-2022-35246: A NoSQL-Injection information disclosure vulnerability vulnerability exists in Rocket.Chat <v5, <v4.8.2 and <v4.7.5 in the getS3FileUrl Meteor server method that can disclose arbitrary file upload URLs to users that should not be able to access.\n\n- CVE-2022-36084: cruddl is software for creating a GraphQL API for a database, using the GraphQL SDL to model a schema. If cruddl starting with version 1.1.0 and prior to versions 2.7.0 and 3.0.2 is used to generate a schema that uses `@flexSearchFulltext`, users of that schema may be able to inject arbitrary AQL queries that will be forwarded to and executed by ArangoDB. Schemas that do not use `@flexSearchFulltext` are not affected. The attacker needs to have `READ` permission to at least one root entity type that has `@flexSearchFulltext` enabled.

As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.\n\nExtended Details:\n\n\n\nImproper encoding or escaping can allow attackers to change the commands that are sent to another component, inserting malicious commands instead.\n\n\nMost products follow a certain protocol that uses structured messages for communication between components, such as queries or commands. These structured messages can contain raw data interspersed with metadata or control information. For example, \"GET /index.html HTTP/1.1\" is a structured message containing a command (\"GET\") with a single argument (\"/index.html\") and metadata about which protocol version is being used (\"HTTP/1.1\").\n\n\nIf an application uses attacker-supplied inputs to construct a structured message without properly encoding or escaping, then the attacker could insert special characters that will cause the data to be interpreted as control information or metadata. Consequently, the component that receives the output will perform the wrong operations, or otherwise interpret the data incorrectly.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-41232: Chain: authentication routine in Go-based agile development product does not escape user name (CWE-116), allowing LDAP injection (CWE-90)\n\n- CVE-2008-4636: OS command injection in backup software using shell metacharacters in a filename; correct behavior would require that this filename could not be changed.\n\n- CVE-2008-0769: Web application does not set the charset when sending a page to a browser, allowing for XSS exploitation when a browser chooses an unexpected encoding.\n\n- CVE-2008-0005: Program does not set the charset when sending a page to a browser, allowing for XSS exploitation when a browser chooses an unexpected encoding.\n\n- CVE-2008-5573: SQL injection via password parameter; a strong password might contain \"&\"\n\n- CVE-2008-3773: Cross-site scripting in chat application via a message subject, which normally might contain \"&\" and other XSS-related characters.\n\n- CVE-2008-0757: Cross-site scripting in chat application via a message, which normally might be allowed to contain arbitrary content.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-20195: A flaw was found in keycloak in versions before 13.0.0. A Self Stored XSS attack vector escalating to a complete account takeover is possible due to user-supplied data fields not being properly encoded and Javascript code being used to process the data. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.\n\n- CVE-2021-21684: Jenkins Git Plugin 4.8.2 and earlier does not escape the Git SHA-1 checksum parameters provided to commit notifications when displaying them in a build cause, resulting in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2021-3148: An issue was discovered in SaltStack Salt before 3002.5. Sending crafted web requests to the Salt API can result in salt.utils.thin.gen_thin() command injection because of different handling of single versus double quotes. This is related to salt/utils/thin.py.\n\n- CVE-2021-32796: xmldom is an open source pure JavaScript W3C standard-based (XML DOM Level 2 Core) DOMParser and XMLSerializer module. xmldom versions 0.6.0 and older do not correctly escape special characters when serializing elements removed from their ancestor. This may lead to unexpected syntactic changes during XML processing in some downstream applications. This issue has been resolved in version 0.7.0. As a workaround downstream applications can validate the input and reject the maliciously crafted documents.\n\n- CVE-2021-30640: A vulnerability in the JNDI Realm of Apache Tomcat allows an attacker to authenticate using variations of a valid user name and/or to bypass some of the protection provided by the LockOut Realm. This issue affects Apache Tomcat 10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.5; 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.45; 8.5.0 to 8.5.65.\n\n- CVE-2020-27958: The Job Composer app in Ohio Supercomputer Center Open OnDemand before 1.7.19 and 1.8.x before 1.8.18 allows remote authenticated users to provide crafted input in a job template.\n\n- CVE-2021-44042: An issue was discovered in UiPath Assistant 21.4.4. User-controlled data supplied to the --process-start argument of the URI handler for uipath-assistant:// is not correctly encoded, resulting in attacker-controlled content being injected into the error message displayed (when the injected content does not match an existing process). A determined attacker could leverage this to execute JavaScript in the context of the Electron application.\n\n- CVE-2022-0210: The Random Banner WordPress plugin is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting due to insufficient escaping via the category parameter found in the ~/include/models/model.php file which allowed attackers with administrative user access to inject arbitrary web scripts, in versions up to and including 4.1.4. This affects multi-site installations where unfiltered_html is disabled for administrators, and sites where unfiltered_html is disabled.\n\n- CVE-2022-0220: The check_privacy_settings AJAX action of the WordPress GDPR WordPress plugin before 1.9.27, available to both unauthenticated and authenticated users, responds with JSON data without an \"application/json\" content-type. Since an HTML payload isn't properly escaped, it may be interpreted by a web browser led to this endpoint. Javascript code may be executed on a victim's browser. Due to v1.9.26 adding a CSRF check, the XSS is only exploitable against unauthenticated users (as they all share the same nonce)\n\n- CVE-2022-0479: The Popup Builder WordPress plugin before 4.1.1 does not sanitise and escape the sgpb-subscription-popup-id parameter before using it in a SQL statement in the All Subscribers admin dashboard, leading to a SQL injection, which could also be used to perform Reflected Cross-Site Scripting attack against a logged in admin opening a malicious link\n\n- CVE-2022-1407: The VikBooking Hotel Booking Engine & PMS WordPress plugin before 1.5.8 does not have CSRF check in place when adding a tracking campaign, and does not escape the campaign fields when outputting them In attributes.

Furthermore, due to the lack of validation, sanitisation and escaping in some of them, it could also lead to Stored XSS issues\n\n- CVE-2022-22734: The Simple Quotation WordPress plugin through 1.3.2 does not have CSRF check when creating or editing a quote and does not sanitise and escape Quotes. As a result, attacker could make a logged in admin create or edit arbitrary quote, and put Cross-Site Scripting payloads in them\n\n- CVE-2022-23603: iTunesRPC-Remastered is a discord rich presence application for use with iTunes & Apple Music. In code before commit 24f43aa user input is not properly sanitized and code injection is possible. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as is possible. There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-23620: XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. In affected versions AbstractSxExportURLFactoryActionHandler#processSx does not escape anything from SSX document references when serializing it on filesystem, it is possible to for the HTML export process to contain reference elements containing filesystem syntax like \"../\", \"./\". or \"/\" in general. The referenced elements are not properly escaped. This issue has been resolved in version 13.6-rc-1. This issue can be worked around by limiting or disabling document export.\n\n- CVE-2022-30966: Jenkins Random String Parameter Plugin 1.0 and earlier does not escape the name and description of Random String parameters on views displaying parameters, resulting in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers with Item/Configure permission.\n\n- CVE-2022-48339: An issue was discovered in GNU Emacs through 28.2. htmlfontify.el has a command injection vulnerability. In the hfy-istext-command function, the parameter file and parameter srcdir come from external input, and parameters are not escaped. If a file name or directory name contains shell metacharacters, code may be executed.\n\n- CVE-2022-24682: An issue was discovered in the Calendar feature in Zimbra Collaboration Suite 8.8.x before 8.8.15 patch 30 (update 1), as exploited in the wild starting in December 2021. An attacker could place HTML containing executable JavaScript inside element attributes. This markup becomes unescaped, causing arbitrary markup to be injected into the document.\n\n- CVE-2022-42948: Cobalt Strike 4.7.1 fails to properly escape HTML tags when they are displayed on Swing components. By injecting crafted HTML code, it is possible to remotely execute code in the Cobalt Strike UI.\n\n- CVE-2021-39027: IBM Guardium Data Encryption (GDE) 4.0.0 and 5.0.0 prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved. IBM X-Force ID: 213865.\n\n- CVE-2022-41934: XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. Any user with view rights on commonly accessible documents including the menu macro can execute arbitrary Groovy, Python or Velocity code in XWiki leading to full access to the XWiki installation due to improper escaping of the macro content and parameters of the menu macro. The problem has been patched in XWiki 14.6RC1, 13.10.8 and 14.4.3. The patch (commit `2fc20891`) for the document `Menu.MenuMacro` can be manually applied or a XAR archive of a patched version can be imported. The menu macro was basically unchanged since XWiki 11.6 so on XWiki 11.6 or later the patch for version of 13.10.8 (commit `59ccca24a`) can most likely be applied, on XWiki version 14.0 and later the versions in XWiki 14.6 and 14.4.3 should be appropriate.\n\n- CVE-2022-45143: The JsonErrorReportValve in Apache Tomcat 8.5.83, 9.0.40 to 9.0.68 and 10.1.0-M1 to 10.1.1 did not escape the type, message or description values. In some circumstances these are constructed from user provided data and it was therefore possible for users to supply values that invalidated or manipulated the JSON output.\n\n- CVE-2022-28960: A PHP injection vulnerability in Spip before v3.2.8 allows attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via the _oups parameter at /ecrire.\n\n- CVE-2022-36099: XWiki Platform Wiki UI Main Wiki is software for managing subwikis on XWiki Platform, a generic wiki platform. Starting with version 5.3-milestone-2 and prior to versions 13.10.6 and 14.4, it's possible to inject arbitrary wiki syntax including Groovy, Python and Velocity script macros via the request (URL parameter) using the `XWikiServerClassSheet` if the user has view access to this sheet and another page that has been saved with programming rights, a standard condition on a public read-only XWiki installation or a private XWiki installation where the user has an account. This allows arbitrary Groovy/Python/Velocity code execution which allows bypassing all rights checks and thus both modification and disclosure of all content stored in the XWiki installation. Also, this could be used to impact the availability of the wiki. This has been patched in versions 13.10.6 and 14.4. As a workaround, edit the affected document `XWiki.XWikiServerClassSheet` or `WikiManager.XWikiServerClassSheet` and manually perform the changes from the patch fixing the issue. On XWiki versions 12.0 and later, it is also possible to import the document `XWiki.XWikiServerClassSheet` from the xwiki-platform-wiki-ui-mainwiki package version 14.4 using the import feature of the administration application as there have been no other changes to this document since XWiki 12.0.\n\n- CVE-2022-36100: XWiki Platform Applications Tag and XWiki Platform Tag UI are tag applications for XWiki, a generic wiki platform. Starting with version 1.7 in XWiki Platform Applications Tag and prior to 13.10.6 and 14.4 in XWiki Platform Tag UI, the tags document `Main.Tags` in XWiki didn't sanitize user inputs properly. This allowed users with view rights on the document (default in a public wiki or for authenticated users on private wikis) to execute arbitrary Groovy, Python and Velocity code with programming rights. This also allowed bypassing all rights checks and thus both modification and disclosure of all content stored in the XWiki installation. The vulnerability could be used to impact the availability of the wiki. On XWiki versions before 13.10.4 and 14.2, this can be combined with CVE-2022-36092, meaning that no rights are required to perform the attack. The vulnerability has been patched in versions 13.10.6 and 14.4. As a workaround, the patch that fixes the issue can be manually applied to the document `Main.Tags` or the updated version of that document can be imported from version 14.4 of xwiki-platform-tag-ui using the import feature in the administration UI on XWiki 10.9 and later.\n\n- CVE-2022-22744: The constructed curl command from the \"Copy as curl\" feature in DevTools was not properly escaped for PowerShell.

The CWE usage of \"access control\" is intended as a general term for the various mechanisms that restrict which users can access which resources, and \"authorization\" is more narrowly defined. It is unlikely that there will be community consensus on the use of these terms.\n\nDescription:\n\nThe product does not restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor.\n\nExtended Details:\n\n\n\nAccess control involves the use of several protection mechanisms such as:\n\n\n  - Authentication (proving the identity of an actor)\n\n  - Authorization (ensuring that a given actor can access a resource), and\n\n  - Accountability (tracking of activities that were performed)\n\nWhen any mechanism is not applied or otherwise fails, attackers can compromise the security of the product by gaining privileges, reading sensitive information, executing commands, evading detection, etc.\n\nThere are two distinct behaviors that can introduce access control weaknesses:\n\n\n  - Specification: incorrect privileges, permissions, ownership, etc. are explicitly specified for either the user or the resource (for example, setting a password file to be world-writable, or giving administrator capabilities to a guest user). This action could be performed by the program or the administrator.\n\n  - Enforcement: the mechanism contains errors that prevent it from properly enforcing the specified access control requirements (e.g., allowing the user to specify their own privileges, or allowing a syntactically-incorrect ACL to produce insecure settings). This problem occurs within the program itself, in that it does not actually enforce the intended security policy that the administrator specifies.\n\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-24985: A form hosting website only checks the session authentication status for a single form, making it possible to bypass authentication when there are multiple forms\n\n- CVE-2022-29238: Access-control setting in web-based document collaboration tool is not properly implemented by the code, which prevents listing hidden directories but does not prevent direct requests to files in those directories.\n\n- CVE-2022-23607: Python-based HTTP library did not scope cookies to a particular domain such that \"supercookies\" could be sent to any domain on redirect\n\n- CVE-2021-21972: Chain: Cloud computing virtualization platform does not require authentication for upload of a tar format file (CWE-306), then uses .. path traversal sequences (CWE-23) in the file to access unexpected files, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2021-37415: IT management product does not perform authentication for some REST API requests, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2021-35033: Firmware for a WiFi router uses a hard-coded password for a BusyBox shell, allowing bypass of authentication through the UART port\n\n- CVE-2020-10263: Bluetooth speaker does not require authentication for the debug functionality on the UART port, allowing root shell access\n\n- CVE-2020-13927: Default setting in workflow management product allows all API requests without authentication, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2010-4624: Bulletin board applies restrictions on number of images during post creation, but does not enforce this on editing.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-1581: Multiple vulnerabilities in the web UI and API endpoints of Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) or Cisco Cloud APIC could allow a remote attacker to perform a command injection or file upload attack on an affected system.

While OS or shell command strings are frequently discovered and targeted, developers may not realize that these other command languages might also be vulnerable to attacks.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nCommand injection: an attack-oriented phrase for this weakness. Note: often used when \"OS command injection\" (CWE-78) was intended.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-74\nChildOf -> CWE-74\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** CWE-77 is often misused when OS command injection (CWE-78) was intended instead [REF-1287].\n**Comments:** Ensure that the analysis focuses on the root-cause error that allows the execution of commands, as there are many weaknesses that can lead to this consequence. See Terminology Notes. If the weakness involves a command language besides OS shell invocation, then CWE-77 could be used.\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n**Suggested Alternatives:**\n- CWE-78: OS Command Injection\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Terminology]** \n\nThe \"command injection\" phrase carries different meanings, either as an attack or as a technical impact. The most common usage of \"command injection\" refers to the more-accurate OS command injection (CWE-78), but there are many command languages.\n\n\nIn vulnerability-focused analysis, the phrase may refer to any situation in which the adversary can execute commands of their own choosing, i.e., the focus is on the risk and/or technical impact of exploitation. Many proof-of-concept exploits focus on the ability to execute commands and may emphasize \"command injection.\" However, there are dozens of weaknesses that can allow execution of commands. That is, the ability to execute commands could be resultant from another weakness.\n\n\nTo some, \"command injection\" can include cases in which the functionality intentionally allows the user to specify an entire command, which is then executed. In this case, the root cause weakness might be related to missing or incorrect authorization, since an adversary should not be able to specify arbitrary commands, but some users or admins are allowed.\n\n\nCWE-77 and its descendants are specifically focused on behaviors in which the product is intentionally building a command to execute, and the adversary can inject separators into the command or otherwise change the command being executed.\n\n\n**[Other]** \n\nCommand injection is a common problem with wrapper programs.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-1509:** injection of sed script syntax (\"sed injection\")\n- **CVE-2024-5184:** API service using a large generative AI model allows direct prompt injection to leak hard-coded system prompts or execute other prompts.\n- **CVE-2020-11698:** anti-spam product allows injection of SNMP commands into confiuration file\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nThis weakness can lead to a vulnerability in environments in which the attacker does not have direct access to the operating system, such as in web applications. Alternately, if the weakness occurs in a privileged program, it could allow the attacker to specify commands that normally would not be accessible, or to call alternate commands with privileges that the attacker does not have. The problem is exacerbated if the compromised process does not follow the principle of least privilege, because the attacker-controlled commands may run with special system privileges that increases the amount of damage.\n\n\nThere are at least two subtypes of OS command injection:\n\n\n  - The application intends to execute a single, fixed program that is under its own control. It intends to use externally-supplied inputs as arguments to that program. For example, the program might use system(\"nslookup [HOSTNAME]\") to run nslookup and allow the user to supply a HOSTNAME, which is used as an argument. Attackers cannot prevent nslookup from executing. However, if the program does not remove command separators from the HOSTNAME argument, attackers could place the separators into the arguments, which allows them to execute their own program after nslookup has finished executing.\n\n  - The application accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run, as well as which commands to use. The application simply redirects this entire command to the operating system. For example, the program might use \"exec([COMMAND])\" to execute the [COMMAND] that was supplied by the user. If the COMMAND is under attacker control, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or programs. If the command is being executed using functions like exec() and CreateProcess(), the attacker might not be able to combine multiple commands together in the same line.\n\nFrom a weakness standpoint, these variants represent distinct programmer errors. In the first variant, the programmer clearly intends that input from untrusted parties will be part of the arguments in the command to be executed. In the second variant, the programmer does not intend for the command to be accessible to any untrusted party, but the programmer probably has not accounted for alternate ways in which malicious attackers can provide input.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nShell injection\nShell metacharacters\nOS Command Injection\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-77\nChildOf -> CWE-74\nChildOf -> CWE-77\nChildOf -> CWE-77\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-88\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Terminology]** The \"OS command injection\" phrase carries different meanings to different people. For some people, it only refers to cases in which the attacker injects command separators into arguments for an application-controlled program that is being invoked. For some people, it refers to any type of attack that can allow the attacker to execute OS commands of their own choosing. This usage could include untrusted search path weaknesses (CWE-426) that cause the application to find and execute an attacker-controlled program. Further complicating the issue is the case when argument injection (CWE-88) allows alternate command-line switches or options to be inserted into the command line, such as an \"-exec\" switch whose purpose may be to execute the subsequent argument as a command (this -exec switch exists in the UNIX \"find\" command, for example). In this latter case, however, CWE-88 could be regarded as the primary weakness in a chain with CWE-78.\n\n**[Research Gap]** More investigation is needed into the distinction between the OS command injection variants, including the role with argument injection (CWE-88). Equivalent distinctions may exist in other injection-related problems such as SQL injection.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2020-10987:** OS command injection in Wi-Fi router, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2020-10221:** Template functionality in network configuration management tool allows OS command injection, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2020-9054:** Chain: improper input validation (CWE-20) in username parameter, leading to OS command injection (CWE-78), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-1336: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product uses a template engine to insert or process externally-influenced input, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements or syntax that can be interpreted as template expressions or other code directives when processed by the engine.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nMany web applications use template engines that allow developers to insert externally-influenced values into free text or messages in order to generate a full web page, document, message, etc. Such engines include Twig, Jinja2, Pug, Java Server Pages, FreeMarker, Velocity, ColdFusion, Smarty, and many others - including PHP itself. Some CMS (Content Management Systems) also use templates.\n\n\nTemplate engines often have their own custom command or expression language. If an attacker can influence input into a template before it is processed, then the attacker can invoke arbitrary expressions, i.e. perform injection attacks. For example, in some template languages, an attacker could inject the expression \"{{7*7}}\" and determine if the output returns \"49\" instead. The syntax varies depending on the language.\n\n\nIn some cases, XSS-style attacks can work, which can obscure the root cause if the developer does not closely investigate the root cause of the error.\n\n\nTemplate engines can be used on the server or client, so both \"sides\" could be affected by injection. The mechanisms of attack or the affected technologies might be different, but the mistake is fundamentally the same.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nServer-Side Template Injection / SSTI: This term is used for injection into template engines being used by a server.\nClient-Side Template Injection / CSTI: This term is used for injection into template engines being used by a client.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-94\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** Since expression languages are often used in templating languages, there may be some overlap with CWE-917 (Expression Language Injection). XSS (CWE-79) is also co-located with template injection.\n\n**[Maintenance]** The interrelationships and differences between CWE-917 and CWE-1336 need to be further clarified.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2024-34359:** Chain: Python bindings for LLM library do not use a sandboxed environment when parsing a template and constructing a prompt, allowing jinja2 Server Side Template Injection and code execution - one variant of a \"prompt injection\" attack.\n- **CVE-2017-16783:** server-side template injection in content management server\n- **CVE-2020-9437:** authentication / identity management product has client-side template injection\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component. Without sufficient removal or quoting of SQL syntax in user-controllable inputs, the generated SQL query can cause those inputs to be interpreted as SQL instead of ordinary user data.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nSQL injection: a common attack-oriented phrase\nSQLi: a common abbreviation for \"SQL injection\"\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-943\nChildOf -> CWE-74\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** SQL injection can be resultant from special character mismanagement, MAID, or denylist/allowlist problems. It can be primary to authentication errors.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2023-32530:** SQL injection in security product dashboard using crafted certificate fields\n- **CVE-2021-42258:** SQL injection in time and billing software, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2021-27101:** SQL injection in file-transfer system via a crafted Host header, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-90: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an LDAP Query ('LDAP Injection')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product constructs all or part of an LDAP query using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended LDAP query when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-943\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** Factors: resultant to special character mismanagement, MAID, or denylist/allowlist problems. Can be primary to authentication and verification errors.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-41232:** Chain: authentication routine in Go-based agile development product does not escape user name (CWE-116), allowing LDAP injection (CWE-90)\n- **CVE-2005-2301:** Server does not properly escape LDAP queries, which allows remote attackers to cause a DoS and possibly conduct an LDAP injection attack.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-161: Improper Neutralization of Multiple Leading Special Elements\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes multiple leading special elements that could be interpreted in unexpected ways when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n### Extended Description\nAs data is parsed, improperly handled multiple leading special elements may cause the process to take unexpected actions that result in an attack.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-160\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2002-1238:** Server allows remote attackers to bypass access restrictions for files via an HTTP request with a sequence of multiple / (slash) characters such as http://www.example.com///file/.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nDenylist / Deny List: This is used by CWE and CAPEC instead of other commonly-used terms. Its counterpart is allowlist.\nBlocklist / Block List: This is often used by security tools such as firewalls, email or web gateways, proxies, etc.\nBlacklist / Black List: This term is frequently used, but usage has been declining as organizations have started to adopt other terms.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-693\nChildOf -> CWE-1023\nCanPrecede -> CWE-79\nCanPrecede -> CWE-78\nCanPrecede -> CWE-434\nCanPrecede -> CWE-98\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** \n\nMultiple interpretation errors can indirectly introduce inputs that should be disallowed. For example, a list of dangerous shell metacharacters might not include a metacharacter that only has meaning in one particular shell, not all of them; or a check for XSS manipulations might ignore an unusual construct that is supported by one web browser, but not others.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2024-4315:** Chain: API for text generation using Large Language Models (LLMs) does not include the \"\\\" Windows folder separator in its denylist (CWE-184) when attempting to prevent Local File Inclusion via path traversal (CWE-22), allowing deletion of arbitrary files on Windows systems.\n- **CVE-2008-2309:** product uses a denylist to identify potentially dangerous content, allowing attacker to bypass a warning\n- **CVE-2005-2782:** PHP remote file inclusion in web application that filters \"http\" and \"https\" URLs, but not \"ftp\".\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n### Extended Description\nMost languages and protocols have their own special elements such as characters and reserved words. These special elements can carry control implications. If product does not prevent external control or influence over the inclusion of such special elements, the control flow of the program may be altered from what was intended. For example, both Unix and Windows interpret the symbol < (\"less than\") as meaning \"read input from a file\".\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-707\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This weakness can be related to interpretation conflicts or interaction errors in intermediaries (such as proxies or application firewalls) when the intermediary's model of an endpoint does not account for protocol-specific special elements.\n\n**[Relationship]** See this entry's children for different types of special elements that have been observed at one point or another. However, it can be difficult to find suitable CVE examples. In an attempt to be complete, CWE includes some types that do not have any associated observed example.\n\n**[Research Gap]** This weakness is probably under-studied for proprietary or custom formats. It is likely that these issues are fairly common in applications that use their own custom format for configuration files, logs, meta-data, messaging, etc. They would only be found by accident or with a focused effort based on an understanding of the format.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2001-0677:** Read arbitrary files from mail client by providing a special MIME header that is internally used to store pathnames for attachments.\n- **CVE-2000-0703:** Setuid program does not cleanse special escape sequence before sending data to a mail program, causing the mail program to process those sequences.\n- **CVE-2003-0020:** Multi-channel issue. Terminal escape sequences not filtered from log files.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-150: Improper Neutralization of Escape, Meta, or Control Sequences\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as escape, meta, or control character sequences when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n### Extended Description\nAs data is parsed, an injected/absent/malformed delimiter may cause the process to take unexpected actions.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-138\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2002-0542:** The mail program processes special \"~\" escape sequence even when not in interactive mode.\n- **CVE-2000-0703:** Setuid program does not filter escape sequences before calling mail program.\n- **CVE-2002-0986:** Mail function does not filter control characters from arguments, allowing mail message content to be modified.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-1236: Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product saves user-provided information into a Comma-Separated Value (CSV) file, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as a command when the file is opened by a spreadsheet product.\n\n### Extended Description\nUser-provided data is often saved to traditional databases. This data can be exported to a CSV file, which allows users to read the data using spreadsheet software such as Excel, Numbers, or Calc. This software interprets entries beginning with '=' as formulas, which are then executed by the spreadsheet software. The software's formula language often allows methods to access hyperlinks or the local command line, and frequently allows enough characters to invoke an entire script. Attackers can populate data fields which, when saved to a CSV file, may attempt information exfiltration or other malicious activity when automatically executed by the spreadsheet software.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nCSV Injection\nFormula Injection\nExcel Macro Injection\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-74\nChildOf -> CWE-74\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2019-12134:** Low privileged user can trigger CSV injection through a contact form field value\n- **CVE-2019-4521:** Cloud management product allows arbitrary command execution via CSV injection\n- **CVE-2019-17661:** CSV injection in content management system via formula code in a first or last name\n\n",

Some CMS (Content Management Systems) also use templates.\n\n\nTemplate engines often have their own custom command or expression language. If an attacker can influence input into a template before it is processed, then the attacker can invoke arbitrary expressions, i.e. perform injection attacks. For example, in some template languages, an attacker could inject the expression \"{{7*7}}\" and determine if the output returns \"49\" instead. The syntax varies depending on the language.\n\n\nIn some cases, XSS-style attacks can work, which can obscure the root cause if the developer does not closely investigate the root cause of the error.\n\n\nTemplate engines can be used on the server or client, so both \"sides\" could be affected by injection. The mechanisms of attack or the affected technologies might be different, but the mistake is fundamentally the same.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2024-34359: Chain: Python bindings for LLM library do not use a sandboxed environment when parsing a template and constructing a prompt, allowing jinja2 Server Side Template Injection and code execution - one variant of a \"prompt injection\" attack.\n\n- CVE-2017-16783: server-side template injection in content management server\n\n- CVE-2020-9437: authentication / identity management product has client-side template injection\n\n- CVE-2020-12790: Server-Side Template Injection using a Twig template\n\n- CVE-2021-21244: devops platform allows SSTI\n\n- CVE-2020-4027: bypass of Server-Side Template Injection protection mechanism with macros in Velocity templates\n\n- CVE-2020-26282: web browser proxy server allows Java EL expressions from Server-Side Template Injection\n\n- CVE-2020-1961: SSTI involving mail templates and JEXL expressions\n\n- CVE-2019-19999: product does not use a \"safe\" setting for a FreeMarker configuration, allowing SSTI\n\n- CVE-2018-20465: product allows read of sensitive database username/password variables using server-side template injection\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-25283: An issue was discovered in through SaltStack Salt before 3002.5.

The issue was patched and a new version was released. Please upgrade to version 9.1.6. There are no known workarounds known.\n\n- CVE-2021-43466: In the thymeleaf-spring5:3.0.12 component, thymeleaf combined with specific scenarios in template injection may lead to remote code execution.\n\n- CVE-2021-32817: express-hbs is an Express handlebars template engine. express-hbs mixes pure template data with engine configuration options through the Express render API. More specifically, the layout parameter may trigger file disclosure vulnerabilities in downstream applications. This potential vulnerability is somewhat restricted in that only files with existing extentions (i.e. file.extension) can be included, files that lack an extension will have .hbs appended to them. For complete details refer to the referenced GHSL-2021-019 report. Notes in documentation have been added to help users of express-hbs avoid this potential information exposure vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2021-32820: Express-handlebars is a Handlebars view engine for Express. Express-handlebars mixes pure template data with engine configuration options through the Express render API. More specifically, the layout parameter may trigger file disclosure vulnerabilities in downstream applications. This potential vulnerability is somewhat restricted in that only files with existing extentions (i.e. file.extension) can be included, files that lack an extension will have .handlebars appended to them.

By overwriting internal configuration options a file disclosure vulnerability may be triggered in downstream applications. For an example PoC see the referenced GHSL-2021-020.\n\n- CVE-2021-29454: Smarty is a template engine for PHP, facilitating the separation of presentation (HTML/CSS) from application logic. Prior to versions 3.1.42 and 4.0.2, template authors could run arbitrary PHP code by crafting a malicious math string. If a math string was passed through as user provided data to the math function, external users could run arbitrary PHP code by crafting a malicious math string. Users should upgrade to version 3.1.42 or 4.0.2 to receive a patch.\n\n- CVE-2021-32649: October CMS is a self-hosted content management system (CMS) platform based on the Laravel PHP Framework. Prior to versions 1.0.473 and 1.1.6, an attacker with \"create, modify and delete website pages\" privileges in the backend is able to execute PHP code by running specially crafted Twig code in the template markup. The issue has been patched in Build 473 (v1.0.473) and v1.1.6. Those unable to upgrade may apply the patch to their installation manually as a workaround.\n\n- CVE-2021-43097: A Server-side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerability exists in bbs 5.3 in TemplateManageAction.javawhich could let a malicoius user execute arbitrary code.\n\n- CVE-2021-43837: vault-cli is a configurable command-line interface tool (and python library) to interact with Hashicorp Vault. In versions before 3.0.0 vault-cli features the ability for rendering templated values. When a secret starts with the prefix `!template!`, vault-cli interprets the rest of the contents of the secret as a Jinja2 template. Jinja2 is a powerful templating engine and is not designed to safely render arbitrary templates. An attacker controlling a jinja2 template rendered on a machine can trigger arbitrary code, making this a Remote Code Execution (RCE) risk. If the content of the vault can be completely trusted, then this is not a problem. Otherwise, if your threat model includes cases where an attacker can manipulate a secret value read from the vault using vault-cli, then this vulnerability may impact you. In 3.0.0, the code related to interpreting vault templated secrets has been removed entirely. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. For users unable to upgrade a workaround does exist. Using the environment variable `VAULT_CLI_RENDER=false` or the flag `--no-render` (placed between `vault-cli` and the subcommand, e.g. `vault-cli --no-render get-all`) or adding `render: false` to the vault-cli configuration yaml file disables rendering and removes the vulnerability. Using the python library, you can use: `vault_cli.get_client(render=False)` when creating your client to get a client that will not render templated secrets and thus operates securely.\n\n- CVE-2021-46063: MCMS v5.2.5 was discovered to contain a Server Side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerability via the Template Management module.\n\n- CVE-2021-40219: Bolt CMS <= 4.2 is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution.

In affected versions Tuleap does not sanitize properly the search filter built from the ldap_id attribute of a user during the daily synchronization. A malicious user could force accounts to be suspended or take over another account by forcing the update of the ldap_uid attribute. Note that the malicious user either need to have site administrator capability on the Tuleap instance or be an LDAP operator with the capability to create/modify account. The Tuleap instance needs to have the LDAP plugin activated and enabled for this issue to be exploitable. This issue has been patched in Tuleap Community Edition 13.2.99.31, Tuleap Enterprise Edition 13.1-5, and Tuleap Enterprise Edition 13.2-3.\n\n- CVE-2021-43782: Tuleap is a Libre and Open Source tool for end to end traceability of application and system developments.

Note that the malicious user either need to have site administrator capability on the Tuleap instance or be an LDAP operator with the capability to create/modify account. The Tuleap instance needs to have the LDAP plugin activated and enabled for this issue to be exploitable. The following versions contain the fix: Tuleap Community Edition 13.2.99.83, Tuleap Enterprise Edition 13.1-6, and Tuleap Enterprise Edition 13.2-4.\n\n- CVE-2021-39031: IBM WebSphere Application Server - Liberty 17.0.0.3 through 22.0.0.1 could allow a remote authenticated attacker to conduct an LDAP injection. By using a specially crafted request, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability and could result in in granting permission to unauthorized resources. IBM X-Force ID: 213875.\n\n- CVE-2022-22360: IBM Sterling Partner Engagement Manager 6.1.2, 6.2, and Cloud/SasS 22.2 could allow a remote authenticated attacker to conduct an LDAP injection. By using a specially crafted request, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability and could result in in granting permission to unauthorized resources. IBM X-Force ID: 220782.\n\n- CVE-2022-45910: Improper neutralization of special elements used in an LDAP query ('LDAP Injection') vulnerability in ActiveDirectory and Sharepoint ActiveDirectory authority connectors of Apache ManifoldCF allows an attacker to manipulate the LDAP search queries (DoS, additional queries, filter manipulation) during user lookup, if the username or the domain string are passed to the UserACLs servlet without validation. This issue affects Apache ManifoldCF version 2.23 and prior versions.\n\n- CVE-2022-24832: GoCD is an open source a continuous delivery server. The bundled gocd-ldap-authentication-plugin included with the GoCD Server fails to correctly escape special characters when using the username to construct LDAP queries. While this does not directly allow arbitrary LDAP data exfiltration, it can allow an existing LDAP-authenticated GoCD user with malicious intent to construct and execute malicious queries, allowing them to deduce facts about other users or entries within the LDAP database (e.g alternate fields, usernames, hashed passwords etc) through brute force mechanisms. This only affects users who have a working LDAP authorization configuration enabled on their GoCD server, and only is exploitable by users authenticating using such an LDAP configuration. This issue has been fixed in GoCD 22.1.0, which is bundled with gocd-ldap-authentication-plugin v2.2.0-144.\n\n- CVE-2022-22975: An issue was discovered in the Pinniped Supervisor with either LADPIdentityProvider or ActiveDirectoryIdentityProvider resources. An attack would involve the malicious user changing the common name (CN) of their user entry on the LDAP or AD server to include special characters, which could be used to perform LDAP query injection on the Supervisor's LDAP query which determines their Kubernetes group membership.\n\n- CVE-2022-31088: LDAP Account Manager (LAM) is a webfrontend for managing entries (e.g. users, groups, DHCP settings) stored in an LDAP directory.

Special characters in filename parameter can be the cause of bypassing code signing check function.\n\n- CVE-2022-0661: The Ad Injection WordPress plugin through 1.2.0.19 does not properly sanitize the body of the adverts injected into the pages, allowing a high privileged user (Admin+) to inject arbitrary HTML or javascript even with unfiltered_html disallowed, leading to a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Further it is also possible to inject PHP code, leading to a Remote Code execution (RCE) vulnerability, even if the DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT and DISALLOW_FILE_MOD constants are both set.\n\n- CVE-2022-35651: A stored XSS and blind SSRF vulnerability was found in Moodle, occurs due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied data in the SCORM track details. A remote attacker can trick the victim to follow a specially crafted link and execute arbitrary HTML and script code in user's browser in context of vulnerable website to steal potentially sensitive information, change appearance of the web page, can perform phishing and drive-by-download attacks.\n\n- CVE-2022-36325: Affected devices do not properly sanitize data introduced by an user when rendering the web interface. This could allow an authenticated remote attacker with administrative privileges to inject code and lead to a DOM-based XSS.\n\n- CVE-2022-4029: The Simple:Press plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the 'sforum_[md5 hash of the WordPress URL]' cookie value in versions up to, and including, 6.8 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link. This would be highly complex to exploit as it would require the attacker to set the cookie a cookie for the targeted user.\n\n- CVE-2022-24720: image_processing is an image processing wrapper for libvips and ImageMagick/GraphicsMagick. Prior to version 1.12.2, using the `#apply` method from image_processing to apply a series of operations that are coming from unsanitized user input allows the attacker to execute shell commands. This method is called internally by Active Storage variants, so Active Storage is vulnerable as well. The vulnerability has been fixed in version 1.12.2 of image_processing. As a workaround, users who process based on user input should always sanitize the user input by allowing only a constrained set of operations.\n\n- CVE-2021-25296: Nagios XI version xi-5.7.5 is affected by OS command injection. The vulnerability exists in the file /usr/local/nagiosxi/html/includes/configwizards/windowswmi/windowswmi.inc.php due to improper sanitization of authenticated user-controlled input by a single HTTP request, which can lead to OS command injection on the Nagios XI server.\n\n- CVE-2021-25297: Nagios XI version xi-5.7.5 is affected by OS command injection.

Symfony versions 4.1.0 before 4.4.35 and versions 5.0.0 before 5.3.12 are vulnerable to CSV injection, also known as formula injection. In Symfony 4.1, maintainers added the opt-in `csv_escape_formulas` option in the `CsvEncoder`, to prefix all cells starting with `=`, `+`, `-` or `@` with a tab `\\\\t`. Since then, OWASP added 2 chars in that list: Tab (0x09) and Carriage return (0x0D). This makes the previous prefix char (Tab `\\\\t`) part of the vulnerable characters, and OWASP suggests using the single quote `'` for prefixing the value.

It is the lack of verification of these assumptions for user-controlled input that leads to injection problems. Injection problems encompass a wide variety of issues -- all mitigated in very different ways and usually attempted in order to alter the control flow of the process. For this reason, the most effective way to discuss these weaknesses is to note the distinct features that classify them as injection weaknesses. The most important issue to note is that all injection problems share one thing in common -- i.e., they allow for the injection of control plane data into the user-controlled data plane. This means that the execution of the process may be altered by sending code in through legitimate data channels, using no other mechanism. While buffer overflows, and many other flaws, involve the use of some further issue to gain execution, injection problems need only for the data to be parsed.\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2024-5184: API service using a large generative AI model allows direct prompt injection to leak hard-coded system prompts or execute other prompts.\n\n- CVE-2022-36069: Python-based dependency management tool avoids OS command injection when generating Git commands but allows injection of optional arguments with input beginning with a dash (CWE-88), potentially allowing for code execution.\n\n- CVE-1999-0067: Canonical example of OS command injection.

But when the product logic depends on the order or number of entities, this can also lead to vulnerabilities. For example, if the query expects to return only one entity that specifies an administrative user, but an attacker can change which entities are returned, this could cause the logic to return information for a regular user and incorrectly assume that the user has administrative privileges.\n\nWhile this weakness is most commonly associated with SQL injection, there are many other query languages that are also subject to injection attacks, including HTSQL, LDAP, DQL, XQuery, Xpath, and \"NoSQL\" languages.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2014-2503: Injection using Documentum Query Language (DQL)\n\n- CVE-2014-2508: Injection using Documentum Query Language (DQL)\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-20736: NoSQL injection vulnerability in GROWI versions prior to v4.2.20 allows a remote attacker to obtain and/or alter the information stored in the database via unspecified vectors.\n\n- CVE-2021-22910: A sanitization vulnerability exists in Rocket.Chat server versions <3.13.2, <3.12.4, <3.11.4 that allowed queries to an endpoint which could result in a NoSQL injection, potentially leading to RCE.\n\n- CVE-2021-22911: A improper input sanitization vulnerability exists in Rocket.Chat server 3.11, 3.12 & 3.13 that could lead to unauthenticated NoSQL injection, resulting potentially in RCE.\n\n- CVE-2022-35246: A NoSQL-Injection information disclosure vulnerability vulnerability exists in Rocket.Chat <v5, <v4.8.2 and <v4.7.5 in the getS3FileUrl Meteor server method that can disclose arbitrary file upload URLs to users that should not be able to access.\n\n- CVE-2022-36084: cruddl is software for creating a GraphQL API for a database, using the GraphQL SDL to model a schema. If cruddl starting with version 1.1.0 and prior to versions 2.7.0 and 3.0.2 is used to generate a schema that uses `@flexSearchFulltext`, users of that schema may be able to inject arbitrary AQL queries that will be forwarded to and executed by ArangoDB. Schemas that do not use `@flexSearchFulltext` are not affected. The attacker needs to have `READ` permission to at least one root entity type that has `@flexSearchFulltext` enabled.

As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.\n\nExtended Details:\n\n\n\nImproper encoding or escaping can allow attackers to change the commands that are sent to another component, inserting malicious commands instead.\n\n\nMost products follow a certain protocol that uses structured messages for communication between components, such as queries or commands. These structured messages can contain raw data interspersed with metadata or control information. For example, \"GET /index.html HTTP/1.1\" is a structured message containing a command (\"GET\") with a single argument (\"/index.html\") and metadata about which protocol version is being used (\"HTTP/1.1\").\n\n\nIf an application uses attacker-supplied inputs to construct a structured message without properly encoding or escaping, then the attacker could insert special characters that will cause the data to be interpreted as control information or metadata. Consequently, the component that receives the output will perform the wrong operations, or otherwise interpret the data incorrectly.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-41232: Chain: authentication routine in Go-based agile development product does not escape user name (CWE-116), allowing LDAP injection (CWE-90)\n\n- CVE-2008-4636: OS command injection in backup software using shell metacharacters in a filename; correct behavior would require that this filename could not be changed.\n\n- CVE-2008-0769: Web application does not set the charset when sending a page to a browser, allowing for XSS exploitation when a browser chooses an unexpected encoding.\n\n- CVE-2008-0005: Program does not set the charset when sending a page to a browser, allowing for XSS exploitation when a browser chooses an unexpected encoding.\n\n- CVE-2008-5573: SQL injection via password parameter; a strong password might contain \"&\"\n\n- CVE-2008-3773: Cross-site scripting in chat application via a message subject, which normally might contain \"&\" and other XSS-related characters.\n\n- CVE-2008-0757: Cross-site scripting in chat application via a message, which normally might be allowed to contain arbitrary content.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-20195: A flaw was found in keycloak in versions before 13.0.0.

The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.\n\n- CVE-2021-21684: Jenkins Git Plugin 4.8.2 and earlier does not escape the Git SHA-1 checksum parameters provided to commit notifications when displaying them in a build cause, resulting in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2021-3148: An issue was discovered in SaltStack Salt before 3002.5. Sending crafted web requests to the Salt API can result in salt.utils.thin.gen_thin() command injection because of different handling of single versus double quotes. This is related to salt/utils/thin.py.\n\n- CVE-2021-32796: xmldom is an open source pure JavaScript W3C standard-based (XML DOM Level 2 Core) DOMParser and XMLSerializer module. xmldom versions 0.6.0 and older do not correctly escape special characters when serializing elements removed from their ancestor. This may lead to unexpected syntactic changes during XML processing in some downstream applications. This issue has been resolved in version 0.7.0. As a workaround downstream applications can validate the input and reject the maliciously crafted documents.\n\n- CVE-2021-30640: A vulnerability in the JNDI Realm of Apache Tomcat allows an attacker to authenticate using variations of a valid user name and/or to bypass some of the protection provided by the LockOut Realm. This issue affects Apache Tomcat 10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.5; 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.45; 8.5.0 to 8.5.65.\n\n- CVE-2020-27958: The Job Composer app in Ohio Supercomputer Center Open OnDemand before 1.7.19 and 1.8.x before 1.8.18 allows remote authenticated users to provide crafted input in a job template.\n\n- CVE-2021-44042: An issue was discovered in UiPath Assistant 21.4.4. User-controlled data supplied to the --process-start argument of the URI handler for uipath-assistant:// is not correctly encoded, resulting in attacker-controlled content being injected into the error message displayed (when the injected content does not match an existing process). A determined attacker could leverage this to execute JavaScript in the context of the Electron application.\n\n- CVE-2022-0210: The Random Banner WordPress plugin is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting due to insufficient escaping via the category parameter found in the ~/include/models/model.php file which allowed attackers with administrative user access to inject arbitrary web scripts, in versions up to and including 4.1.4. This affects multi-site installations where unfiltered_html is disabled for administrators, and sites where unfiltered_html is disabled.\n\n- CVE-2022-0220: The check_privacy_settings AJAX action of the WordPress GDPR WordPress plugin before 1.9.27, available to both unauthenticated and authenticated users, responds with JSON data without an \"application/json\" content-type. Since an HTML payload isn't properly escaped, it may be interpreted by a web browser led to this endpoint. Javascript code may be executed on a victim's browser. Due to v1.9.26 adding a CSRF check, the XSS is only exploitable against unauthenticated users (as they all share the same nonce)\n\n- CVE-2022-0479: The Popup Builder WordPress plugin before 4.1.1 does not sanitise and escape the sgpb-subscription-popup-id parameter before using it in a SQL statement in the All Subscribers admin dashboard, leading to a SQL injection, which could also be used to perform Reflected Cross-Site Scripting attack against a logged in admin opening a malicious link\n\n- CVE-2022-1407: The VikBooking Hotel Booking Engine & PMS WordPress plugin before 1.5.8 does not have CSRF check in place when adding a tracking campaign, and does not escape the campaign fields when outputting them In attributes.

If a file name or directory name contains shell metacharacters, code may be executed.\n\n- CVE-2022-24682: An issue was discovered in the Calendar feature in Zimbra Collaboration Suite 8.8.x before 8.8.15 patch 30 (update 1), as exploited in the wild starting in December 2021. An attacker could place HTML containing executable JavaScript inside element attributes. This markup becomes unescaped, causing arbitrary markup to be injected into the document.\n\n- CVE-2022-42948: Cobalt Strike 4.7.1 fails to properly escape HTML tags when they are displayed on Swing components. By injecting crafted HTML code, it is possible to remotely execute code in the Cobalt Strike UI.\n\n- CVE-2021-39027: IBM Guardium Data Encryption (GDE) 4.0.0 and 5.0.0 prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved. IBM X-Force ID: 213865.\n\n- CVE-2022-41934: XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. Any user with view rights on commonly accessible documents including the menu macro can execute arbitrary Groovy, Python or Velocity code in XWiki leading to full access to the XWiki installation due to improper escaping of the macro content and parameters of the menu macro. The problem has been patched in XWiki 14.6RC1, 13.10.8 and 14.4.3. The patch (commit `2fc20891`) for the document `Menu.MenuMacro` can be manually applied or a XAR archive of a patched version can be imported. The menu macro was basically unchanged since XWiki 11.6 so on XWiki 11.6 or later the patch for version of 13.10.8 (commit `59ccca24a`) can most likely be applied, on XWiki version 14.0 and later the versions in XWiki 14.6 and 14.4.3 should be appropriate.\n\n- CVE-2022-45143: The JsonErrorReportValve in Apache Tomcat 8.5.83, 9.0.40 to 9.0.68 and 10.1.0-M1 to 10.1.1 did not escape the type, message or description values. In some circumstances these are constructed from user provided data and it was therefore possible for users to supply values that invalidated or manipulated the JSON output.\n\n- CVE-2022-28960: A PHP injection vulnerability in Spip before v3.2.8 allows attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via the _oups parameter at /ecrire.\n\n- CVE-2022-36099: XWiki Platform Wiki UI Main Wiki is software for managing subwikis on XWiki Platform, a generic wiki platform. Starting with version 5.3-milestone-2 and prior to versions 13.10.6 and 14.4, it's possible to inject arbitrary wiki syntax including Groovy, Python and Velocity script macros via the request (URL parameter) using the `XWikiServerClassSheet` if the user has view access to this sheet and another page that has been saved with programming rights, a standard condition on a public read-only XWiki installation or a private XWiki installation where the user has an account. This allows arbitrary Groovy/Python/Velocity code execution which allows bypassing all rights checks and thus both modification and disclosure of all content stored in the XWiki installation. Also, this could be used to impact the availability of the wiki. This has been patched in versions 13.10.6 and 14.4. As a workaround, edit the affected document `XWiki.XWikiServerClassSheet` or `WikiManager.XWikiServerClassSheet` and manually perform the changes from the patch fixing the issue. On XWiki versions 12.0 and later, it is also possible to import the document `XWiki.XWikiServerClassSheet` from the xwiki-platform-wiki-ui-mainwiki package version 14.4 using the import feature of the administration application as there have been no other changes to this document since XWiki 12.0.\n\n- CVE-2022-36100: XWiki Platform Applications Tag and XWiki Platform Tag UI are tag applications for XWiki, a generic wiki platform. Starting with version 1.7 in XWiki Platform Applications Tag and prior to 13.10.6 and 14.4 in XWiki Platform Tag UI, the tags document `Main.Tags` in XWiki didn't sanitize user inputs properly. This allowed users with view rights on the document (default in a public wiki or for authenticated users on private wikis) to execute arbitrary Groovy, Python and Velocity code with programming rights. This also allowed bypassing all rights checks and thus both modification and disclosure of all content stored in the XWiki installation. The vulnerability could be used to impact the availability of the wiki. On XWiki versions before 13.10.4 and 14.2, this can be combined with CVE-2022-36092, meaning that no rights are required to perform the attack. The vulnerability has been patched in versions 13.10.6 and 14.4. As a workaround, the patch that fixes the issue can be manually applied to the document `Main.Tags` or the updated version of that document can be imported from version 14.4 of xwiki-platform-tag-ui using the import feature in the administration UI on XWiki 10.9 and later.\n\n- CVE-2022-22744: The constructed curl command from the \"Copy as curl\" feature in DevTools was not properly escaped for PowerShell. This could have lead to command injection if pasted into a Powershell prompt.<br>*This bug only affects Thunderbird for Windows. Other operating systems are unaffected.*.

The CWE usage of \"access control\" is intended as a general term for the various mechanisms that restrict which users can access which resources, and \"authorization\" is more narrowly defined. It is unlikely that there will be community consensus on the use of these terms.\n\nDescription:\n\nThe product does not restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor.\n\nExtended Details:\n\n\n\nAccess control involves the use of several protection mechanisms such as:\n\n\n  - Authentication (proving the identity of an actor)\n\n  - Authorization (ensuring that a given actor can access a resource), and\n\n  - Accountability (tracking of activities that were performed)\n\nWhen any mechanism is not applied or otherwise fails, attackers can compromise the security of the product by gaining privileges, reading sensitive information, executing commands, evading detection, etc.\n\nThere are two distinct behaviors that can introduce access control weaknesses:\n\n\n  - Specification: incorrect privileges, permissions, ownership, etc. are explicitly specified for either the user or the resource (for example, setting a password file to be world-writable, or giving administrator capabilities to a guest user). This action could be performed by the program or the administrator.\n\n  - Enforcement: the mechanism contains errors that prevent it from properly enforcing the specified access control requirements (e.g., allowing the user to specify their own privileges, or allowing a syntactically-incorrect ACL to produce insecure settings). This problem occurs within the program itself, in that it does not actually enforce the intended security policy that the administrator specifies.\n\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-24985: A form hosting website only checks the session authentication status for a single form, making it possible to bypass authentication when there are multiple forms\n\n- CVE-2022-29238: Access-control setting in web-based document collaboration tool is not properly implemented by the code, which prevents listing hidden directories but does not prevent direct requests to files in those directories.\n\n- CVE-2022-23607: Python-based HTTP library did not scope cookies to a particular domain such that \"supercookies\" could be sent to any domain on redirect\n\n- CVE-2021-21972: Chain: Cloud computing virtualization platform does not require authentication for upload of a tar format file (CWE-306), then uses .. path traversal sequences (CWE-23) in the file to access unexpected files, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2021-37415: IT management product does not perform authentication for some REST API requests, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2021-35033: Firmware for a WiFi router uses a hard-coded password for a BusyBox shell, allowing bypass of authentication through the UART port\n\n- CVE-2020-10263: Bluetooth speaker does not require authentication for the debug functionality on the UART port, allowing root shell access\n\n- CVE-2020-13927: Default setting in workflow management product allows all API requests without authentication, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2010-4624: Bulletin board applies restrictions on number of images during post creation, but does not enforce this on editing.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-1581: Multiple vulnerabilities in the web UI and API endpoints of Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) or Cisco Cloud APIC could allow a remote attacker to perform a command injection or file upload attack on an affected system.

Some CMS (Content Management Systems) also use templates.\n\n\nTemplate engines often have their own custom command or expression language. If an attacker can influence input into a template before it is processed, then the attacker can invoke arbitrary expressions, i.e. perform injection attacks. For example, in some template languages, an attacker could inject the expression \"{{7*7}}\" and determine if the output returns \"49\" instead. The syntax varies depending on the language.\n\n\nIn some cases, XSS-style attacks can work, which can obscure the root cause if the developer does not closely investigate the root cause of the error.\n\n\nTemplate engines can be used on the server or client, so both \"sides\" could be affected by injection. The mechanisms of attack or the affected technologies might be different, but the mistake is fundamentally the same.\n",
