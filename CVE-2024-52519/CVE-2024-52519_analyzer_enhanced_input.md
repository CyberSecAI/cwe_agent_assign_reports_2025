## Vulnerability Description
Nextcloud Server is a self hosted personal cloud system. The OAuth2 client secrets were stored in a recoverable way, so that an attacker that got access to a backup of the database and the Nextcloud config file, would be able to decrypt them. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server is upgraded to 28.0.10 or 29.0.7 and Nextcloud Enterprise Server is upgraded to 27.1.11.8, 28.0.10 or 29.0.7.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **OAuth2 client secrets stored in recoverable way**
- **impact:** decrypt OAuth2 client secrets
- **vector:** access to database backup and Nextcloud config file
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** Nextcloud Server
- **version:** prior to 28.0.10, 29.0.7

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-52519:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The OAuth2 client secrets were stored in an encrypted format that was reversible. An attacker gaining access to the database and Nextcloud configuration file could decrypt these secrets.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insecure Storage of Sensitive Data:**  Instead of storing a hash of the secret, the application was storing the encrypted secret. This meant that with access to the encryption key, the secrets could be decrypted and recovered.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker who obtains a database backup and the Nextcloud config file can decrypt stored OAuth2 client secrets.
- **Potential Further Attacks:** Recovered secrets could be used to impersonate applications using OAuth2 to access Nextcloud data.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Physical Access to Backups:** The primary attack vector involves an attacker gaining access to backups of the Nextcloud database and the Nextcloud configuration files. This would require access to the server or storage medium.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Access to Database Backup:** The attacker must be able to access a backup of the Nextcloud database.
- **Access to Nextcloud Configuration:** The attacker must have access to the Nextcloud config file, which contains the encryption key needed for decryption.
- **High Privileges Required:** The attacker would likely need high privileges to access the database backups and configuration file on the server.
- **User Interaction Required:** The attack requires the user to generate the database backup.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

- **Mitigation:** The fix involves storing a hash of the client secret rather than encrypting it. This makes the secret non-recoverable, thus mitigating the vulnerability.
- **Affected Versions:** Nextcloud Server versions >= 28.0.0 and >= 29.0.0, and Nextcloud Enterprise Server versions >= 27.0.0, >= 28.0.0, and >= 29.0.0 were affected.
- **Patched Versions:** Patched versions are 28.0.10 and 29.0.7 for Nextcloud Server, and 27.1.11.8, 28.0.10, and 29.0.7 for Nextcloud Enterprise Server.
- **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability was given a CVSS v3 base score of 2.7, with vector string: CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N.
- **CWE:**  The vulnerability is associated with CWE-922 which refers to Insecure Storage of Sensitive Data.
- **Pull Request:** The fix was implemented in pull request #47635 on the Nextcloud server repository.

In summary, this vulnerability stems from storing OAuth2 client secrets in a reversibly encrypted way, which could lead to a confidentiality breach if an attacker gained access to the database backups and config file. The fix replaces this with hashing the secrets, making them non-recoverable.
