  "description": "Vulnerability in the JD Edwards EnterpriseOne Tools product of Oracle JD Edwards (component Web Runtime SEC). Supported versions that are affected are 9.2.0.0-9.2.9.2. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise JD Edwards EnterpriseOne Tools. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in JD Edwards EnterpriseOne Tools, attacks may significantly impact additional products (scope change). Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of JD Edwards EnterpriseOne Tools accessible data as well as unauthorized read access to a subset of JD Edwards EnterpriseOne Tools accessible data.

CWE-200 and CWE-732 represent potential impacts of the missing authentication, specifically unauthorized information access and incorrect permission assignments, respectively. These two are Class level CWE's and could have been more specific, but without more details on the specific vulnerabilities, they are appropriate.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe732[\"CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n\n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe200 --.IMPACT.--> cwe306\n    cwe732 --.IMPACT.--> cwe306\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe306 primary\n    class cwe200,cwe732 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **missing authentication** (CWE-306), which allows an unauthenticated attacker to gain unauthorized access. This leads to potential **exposure of sensitive information** (CWE-200) and **incorrect permission assignments** (CWE-732), ultimately resulting in unauthorized data modification and read access.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary focus is on the **lack of authentication** for critical functions, which is directly supported by the description mentioning an \"unauthenticated attacker.\" The other CWEs are added because of the unauthorized access to data that leads to read, insert, update or delete capability.\n\nThe selection of CWE-306 as the primary CWE is based on the fact that the vulnerability is easily exploitable by an **unauthenticated attacker**. The other CWEs are a result of this **missing authentication**. The evidence for this is the statement \"Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise JD Edwards EnterpriseOne Tools.\"\n\nCWE-200 and CWE-732 were considered but not selected as the primary CWE because they are consequences of the missing authentication, not the root cause.
