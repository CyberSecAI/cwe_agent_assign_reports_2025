  "query": "Vulnerability in the JD Edwards EnterpriseOne Tools product of Oracle JD Edwards (component Web Runtime SEC). Supported versions that are affected are 9.2.0.0-9.2.9.2. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise JD Edwards EnterpriseOne Tools. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in JD Edwards EnterpriseOne Tools, attacks may significantly impact additional products (scope change). Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of JD Edwards EnterpriseOne Tools accessible data as well as unauthorized read access to a subset of JD Edwards EnterpriseOne Tools accessible data.
