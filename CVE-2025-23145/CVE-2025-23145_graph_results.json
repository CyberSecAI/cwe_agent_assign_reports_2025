  "query": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved mptcp fix NULL pointer in can_accept_new_subflow When testing valkey benchmark tool with MPTCP, the kernel panics in mptcp_can_accept_new_subflow because subflow_req->msk is NULL. Call trace mptcp_can_accept_new_subflow (./net/mptcp/subflow.c63 (discriminator 4)) (P) subflow_syn_recv_sock (./net/mptcp/subflow.c854) tcp_check_req (./net/ipv4/tcp_minisocks.c863) tcp_v4_rcv (./net/ipv4/tcp_ipv4.c2268) ip_protocol_deliver_rcu (./net/ipv4/ip_input.c207) ip_local_deliver_finish (./net/ipv4/ip_input.c234) ip_local_deliver (./net/ipv4/ip_input.c254) ip_rcv_finish (./net/ipv4/ip_input.c449) ... According to the debug log, the same req received two SYN-ACK in a very short time, very likely because the client retransmits the syn ack due to multiple reasons. Even if the packets are transmitted with a relevant time interval, they can be processed by the server on different CPUs concurrently). The subflow_req->msk ownership is transferred to the subflow the first, and there will be a risk of a null pointer dereference here. This patch fixes this issue by moving the subflow_req->msk under the `own_req == true` conditional. Note that the !msk check in subflow_hmac_valid() can be dropped, because the same check already exists under the own_req mpj branch where the code has been moved to.",
