## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, was found in Open Asset Import Library Assimp 5.4.3. This affects the function AssimpCSMImporterInternReadFile of the file code/AssetLib/CSM/CSMLoader.cpp of the component CSM File Handler. The manipulation leads to **out-of-bounds write**. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **out-of-bounds write**
- **product:** Open Asset Import Library Assimp
- **version:** 5.4.3
- **component:** function AssimpCSMImporterInternReadFile of the file code/AssetLib/CSM/CSMLoader.cpp of the component CSM File Handler

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
**Relevant content from github.com_59bf1330_20250624_200027.html:**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Out-of-bounds write in `Assimp::CSMImporter::InternReadFile`.  Specifically, in `code/AssetLib/CSM/CSMLoader.cpp:218`, the code writes to an arbitrary address with arbitrary data.

    ```
    aiVectorKey* sub = s->mPositionKeys + s->mNumPositionKeys;
    sub->mTime = (double)frame;
    ```
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Out-of-bounds write vulnerability (CWE-787).
*   **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker could potentially cause remote code execution by tricking a victim into running assimp on a malformed CSM file.
*   **Affected:** assimp >= 5.4.3
*   **Attack vectors:**  The vulnerability can be triggered by a crafted CSM file.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted CSM file to a victim that uses the assimp library.
*   **Mitigation or fix:**  The document does not provide information on mitigation or fix.
*   **More detail than the official CVE description:** The content provides specific code snippets and line numbers where the vulnerability exists. It also describes a Proof of Concept (PoC) for triggering the bug using a fuzzer and provides a sanitizer report.
