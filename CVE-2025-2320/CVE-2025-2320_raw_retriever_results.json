Affected by this vulnerability is the function submit of the file /api/blade-user/submit of the component User Handler. The manipulation leads to improper authorization. The attack can be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. This product takes the approach of rolling releases to provide continious delivery. Therefore, version details for affected and updated releases are not available. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",
