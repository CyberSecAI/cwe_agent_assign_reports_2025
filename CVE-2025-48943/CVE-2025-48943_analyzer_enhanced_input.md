## Vulnerability Description
vLLM is an inference and serving engine for large language models (LLMs). Version 0.8.0 up to but excluding 0.9.0 have a **Denial of Service (ReDoS)** that causes the vLLM server to crash if an invalid regex was provided while using structured output. This vulnerability is similar to GHSA-6qc9-v4r8-22xg/CVE-2025-48942, but for regex instead of a JSON schema. Version 0.9.0 fixes the issue.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **Denial of Service (ReDoS)**
- **impact:** crash vLLM server
- **product:** vLLM
- **version:** 0.8.0 up to but excluding 0.9.0
