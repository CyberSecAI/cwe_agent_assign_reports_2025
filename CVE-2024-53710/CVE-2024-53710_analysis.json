The specific impact will vary depending on the actions that can be triggered.\n- **Attack vectors**: The attacker would need to craft a malicious request that is then triggered by an authenticated user.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not require any specific privileges and can be unauthenticated, however they need to trick an authenticated user into executing a crafted request.",

This allows an attacker to trick an authenticated user into performing actions, leading to the injection of malicious scripts.

The primary weakness is **CWE-352**, as the **lack of CSRF protection** allows attackers to induce users to perform unwanted actions.
