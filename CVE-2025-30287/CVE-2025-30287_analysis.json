  "description": "ColdFusion versions 2023.12, 2021.18, 2025.0 and earlier are affected by an ****Improper Authentication** vulnerability** that could result in arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user. A low privileged attacker with local access could leverage this vulnerability to bypass security protections and execute code. Exploitation of this issue requires user interaction in that a victim must be coerced into performing actions within the application and scope is changed.",

The guidance provided and the description of the vulnerability both emphasize **Improper Authentication** as the root cause. Although other CWEs like CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) were considered, the evidence points more strongly to a failure in initial authentication rather than a flaw in authorization after successful authentication. The vulnerability description and the CVE reference link content summary both use the term \"Improper Authentication\" as the primary weakness.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    \n    class cwe287 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **Improper Authentication** (CWE-287), which allows a low-privileged attacker with local access to bypass security protections, leading to arbitrary code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe analysis is heavily based on the provided evidence, particularly the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" and the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary,\" both of which explicitly state \"**Improper Authentication**\" as the key weakness. The provided guidance on Authentication vs. Authorization helped confirm that CWE-287 is the most appropriate choice, as the vulnerability stems from a failure to properly validate the user's identity.
