It provides more detail than a standard CVE description, detailing the vulnerability, impact, and mitigation.\\n\\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\\n\\nThe vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). The document doesn\\'t specify the exact root cause within the OmniLeads Scripts and Tags Manager plugin, only that it exists.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\\n\\n*   Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\\n\\n**Impact of exploitation:**\\n\\nA malicious actor could force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact varies case by case.\\n\\n**Attack vectors:**\\n\\nThe attack vector is through Cross-Site Request Forgery, meaning an attacker would need to trick a logged-in user into performing an action on the vulnerable website.\\n\\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\\n\\n*   Unauthenticated - The attacker does not need to be authenticated.\\n*   Ability to create a malicious website or inject malicious content into a trusted site.\\n*   Ability to trick a logged-in user into visiting the malicious site or clicking a malicious link.\\n\\n**Mitigation or fix:**\\n\\n*   No official fix is currently available (as of March 28, 2025).\\n*   Patchstack offers \"vPatching\" as a mitigation, which auto-mitigates the vulnerability even without an official patch.\\n*   The report indicates a low severity impact and low likelihood of exploitation.', similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {}, 'top_cwes_by_threshold': {}}}, similarity_summary=SimilarityInsight(consensus_cwe='', top_cwes=[], confidence_levels={}, total_samples=0), analysis='', analysis_with_relationships='', criticism='', resolution='', relevant_cwes=[{'metadata': {'doc_id': '352', 'name': 'Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'weakness:cross-site scripting', 'keyphrase': 'cross-site scripting', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'weakness:CSRF', 'keyphrase': 'CSRF', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'weakness:XSS', 'keyphrase': 'XSS', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'product:danielmuldernl OmniLeads Scripts and Tags Manager', 'keyphrase': 'danielmuldernl OmniLeads Scripts and Tags Manager', 'type': 'product'}, {'id': 'version:n/a through 1.3', 'keyphrase': 'n/a through 1.3', 'type': 'version'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(294.87385448367695)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '79', 'name': \"Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\", 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'weakness:cross-site scripting', 'keyphrase': 'cross-site scripting', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'weakness:CSRF', 'keyphrase': 'CSRF', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'weakness:XSS', 'keyphrase': 'XSS', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'product:danielmuldernl OmniLeads Scripts and Tags Manager', 'keyphrase': 'danielmuldernl OmniLeads Scripts and Tags Manager', 'type': 'product'}, {'id': 'version:n/a through 1.3', 'keyphrase': 'n/a through 1.3', 'type': 'version'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(280.64969631536604)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '80', 'name': 'Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'weakness:cross-site scripting', 'keyphrase': 'cross-site scripting', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'weakness:XSS', 'keyphrase': 'XSS', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'product:danielmuldernl OmniLeads Scripts and Tags Manager', 'keyphrase': 'danielmuldernl OmniLeads Scripts and Tags Manager', 'type': 'product'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(244.03135393182484)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '116', 'name': 'Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
