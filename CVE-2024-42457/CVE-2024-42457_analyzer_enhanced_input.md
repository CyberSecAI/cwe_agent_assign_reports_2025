## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability in Veeam Backup & Replication allows users with certain operator roles to expose saved credentials by leveraging a combination of methods in a remote management interface. This can be achieved using a session object that allows for credential enumeration and exploitation, leading to the leak of plaintext credentials to a malicious host. The attack is facilitated by **improper usage of a method** that allows operators to add a new host with an attacker-controlled IP, enabling them to retrieve sensitive credentials in plaintext.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **improper usage of a method**
- **impact:** expose saved credentials
- **vector:** session object
- **attacker:** users with certain operator roles
- **product:** Veeam Backup & Replication
- **component:** remote management interface

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2024-42457:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a combination of methods within the remote management interface of Veeam Backup & Replication. It allows an authenticated user with specific operator roles to access saved credentials.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Exposure of saved credentials through the remote management interface.
- Inadequate access controls for certain operator roles.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can gain access to sensitive credentials stored within the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- Exploitation occurs through the remote management interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with an assigned operator role within the Veeam Backup & Replication user and roles settings.

**Additional details:**
