This can be achieved using a session object that allows for credential enumeration and exploitation, leading to the leak of plaintext credentials to a malicious host. The attack is facilitated by improper usage of a method that allows operators to add a new host with an attacker-controlled IP, enabling them to retrieve sensitive credentials in plaintext.
