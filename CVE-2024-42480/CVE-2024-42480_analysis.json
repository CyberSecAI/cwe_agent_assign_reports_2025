  "description": "Kamaji is the Hosted Control Plane Manager for Kubernetes. In versions 1.0.0 and earlier, Kamaji uses an **open at the top range definition in RBAC for etcd roles** leading to some TCPs API servers being able to read, write, and delete the data of other control planes. This vulnerability is fixed in edge-24.8.2.",

  },
  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-42480:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from the use of an \"open at the top\" range definition in the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) configuration for etcd roles within the Kamaji project. Specifically, the `rangeEnd` variable was set to `\\0`, which in etcd signifies \"everything that comes after\" the specified key. This allowed a TCP (Tenant Control Plane) API server to potentially read, write, and delete data belonging to other control planes.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n-   **Insecure RBAC Configuration:** The use of `\\0` as the range end in etcd RBAC rules created overly broad permissions.\n-   **Lack of Disjoint Permissions:** The RBAC roles created for each TCP were not properly isolated, leading to potential cross-tenant data access.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n-   **Full Control Over Other TCPs Data:** An attacker who gains access to one control plane can potentially obtain full control over other TCP's data if they know the names of other TCPs using the same datastore.\n-   **Data Breach and Manipulation:** The ability to read, write, and delete data from other TCPs can lead to data breaches, data corruption, and denial of service attacks.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n1.  **Compromise of a TCP:** An attacker could first compromise a Tenant Control Plane.\n2.  **Knowledge of other TCPs names:**  The attacker needs to know the names of other TCPs that use the same datastore.\n3.  **Access to API Server Certificates:** The attacker needs to obtain the user certificates used by the compromised control plane or the ability to configure the kube-apiserver deployment.\n4.  **Modification of `etcd-prefix` Flag:** The attacker must be able to modify the Kubernetes API Server `--etcd-prefix` flag to point to another TCP's datastore key.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n-   **Initial Access:** The attacker needs initial access to at least one Tenant Control Plane (TCP).\n-   **Configuration Control:** The attacker needs the ability to modify the Kubernetes API server's configuration, specifically the `--etcd-prefix` flag, or be able to obtain the user certificates.\n-   **Knowledge of the system:**  The attacker needs to know the name of the other TCPs to exploit the vulnerability.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n- The vulnerability is present in Kamaji versions <= 1.0.0.\n- The vulnerability has been fixed in the `edge-24.8.2` version.\n- The fix involves using `etcdclient.GetPrefixRangeEnd(key)` to generate the range end, which ensures that the range is limited to the specific key prefix and does not include keys of other control planes.",

CWE-863 is a more specific type of authorization issue than CWE-285, but less specific than CWE-639.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe639 -->|CHILDOF| cwe863\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe639 secondary\n    class cwe285 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **incorrect** RBAC configuration, specifically an **open at the top range definition in RBAC for etcd roles**. This leads to **incorrect authorization**, allowing TCP API servers to read, write, and delete data of other control planes. The impact is a potential data breach and manipulation.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-863 (**Incorrect Authorization**) because the **root cause** is an **incorrect** configuration of RBAC roles that allows unauthorized access.\n\nThe supporting evidence is:\n*   The vulnerability description states that Kamaji uses an \"**open at the top range definition in RBAC for etcd roles** leading to some TCPs API servers being able to read, write, and delete the data of other control planes.\"\n*   The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms this by stating: \"The vulnerability stems from the use of an 'open at the top' range definition in the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) configuration for etcd roles within the Kamaji project.\"\n*   The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" states: \"The RBAC roles created for each TCP were not properly isolated, leading to potential cross-tenant data access.\"\n\nCWE-863 (**Incorrect Authorization**) is preferred over CWE-285 (**Improper Authorization**) because it's more specific, indicating that an authorization check is performed but is done incorrectly.\n\nCWE-639 (**Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key**) was considered because the attacker needs to modify the `etcd-prefix` flag, which can be seen as a user-controlled key. However, the primary issue is the **incorrect** RBAC configuration, not the modification of a key. Therefore, CWE-639 is a secondary concern.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately capture the root cause and the contributing factors to the vulnerability, based on the available evidence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product establishes a communication channel to (or from) an endpoint for privileged or protected operations, but it does not properly ensure that it is communicating with the correct endpoint.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not Selected:* The vulnerability does not primarily involve issues related to communication channels.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
