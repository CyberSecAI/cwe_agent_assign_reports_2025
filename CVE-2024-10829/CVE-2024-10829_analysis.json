CWE-835 can be caused by CWE-1322 \"Use of Blocking Code in Single-threaded, Non-blocking Context\" and can precede CWE-476 \"Null Pointer Dereference\". The secondary CWE is CWE-400, which is a Class level CWE and is parent of CWE-410 \"Insufficient Resource Pool\".\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe835[\"CWE-835: Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe410[\"CWE-410: Insufficient Resource Pool\"]\n    cwe1322[\"CWE-1322: Use of Blocking Code in Single-threaded, Non-blocking Context\"]\n    cwe476[\"CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference\"]\n\n    cwe410 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    cwe1322 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe835\n    cwe835 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe476\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe835 primary\n    class cwe400 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the server **failing to handle excessive characters appended to the end of multipart boundaries**. This leads to an **infinite loop** (CWE-835) which causes excessive resource consumption and results in complete denial of service (CWE-400).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that the server **fails to handle excessive characters appended to the end of multipart boundaries**, leading to an **infinite loop** and complete denial of service.\n\nCWE-835 \"Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')\" is the most appropriate primary CWE because the core issue is the **infinite loop** caused by the **failure to handle excessive characters**. The **infinite loop** is the direct result of the **root cause**.\n\nCWE-400 \"Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\" is a reasonable secondary CWE because the **infinite loop** directly leads to excessive resource consumption, resulting in a denial-of-service condition. However, it is a Class level CWE, so it is less specific than CWE-835.\n\nOther CWEs Considered:\n\n*   CWE-770 \"Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\": While resource consumption is involved, the root cause isn't an unlimited allocation of resources, but rather an **infinite loop**.\n*   CWE-789 \"Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\": This CWE is related to memory allocation, but the description doesn't specifically mention memory allocation issues. The problem is more about processing data in a loop.\n*   CWE-1333 \"Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\": While this might be a contributing factor, the description doesn't focus on regular expression inefficiency. The primary issue is the **infinite loop** caused by the boundary processing.\n* CWE-1284 \"Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\": Could be a contributing factor but the description focuses on the infinite loop so is not as relevant.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-835 is a Base CWE and directly reflects the **infinite loop**. CWE-400 is a Class CWE, but it accurately describes the impact of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe
