  "query": "The LatePoint plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Arbitrary User Password Change via SQL Injection in versions up to, and including, 5.0.11. This is due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change user passwords and potentially take over administrator accounts. Note that changing a WordPress users password is only possible if the Use WordPress users as customers setting is enabled, which is disabled by default. Without this setting enabled, only the passwords of plugin customers, which are stored and managed in a separate database table, can be modified.",
