## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability in the `KnowledgeBaseWebReader` class of the run-llama/llama_index repository, version latest, allows an attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) by controlling a URL variable to contain the root URL. This leads to infinite recursive calls to the `get_article_urls` method, exhausting system resources and potentially crashing the application.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** Denial of Service (DoS)
- **vector:** controlling a URL variable to contain the root URL
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** run-llama/llama_index repository
- **version:** latest
- **component:** KnowledgeBaseWebReader class

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2024-12910 Content

The provided content relates to a fix for a potential infinite recursion vulnerability in the `llama_index` library. Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability was caused by a missing `max_depth` parameter in the `get_article_urls` function, leading to potentially infinite recursion when crawling through a knowledge base.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Infinite recursion: The recursive nature of the `get_article_urls` function, without a depth limit, could lead to a stack overflow or excessive resource consumption.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Denial of Service (DoS): An attacker could potentially trigger the infinite recursion, causing the application to crash or become unresponsive.
*   Resource exhaustion: The uncontrolled recursion could consume significant system resources (CPU, memory).

**Attack vectors:**

*   A malicious or poorly configured knowledge base with circular links could trigger the recursion.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker would need to be able to influence the `root_url` or the structure of the knowledge base being crawled.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   The fix introduces a `max_depth` parameter to the `get_article_urls` function, limiting the recursion depth and preventing the infinite loop.
*   The `max_depth` parameter is defaulted to 100.
*   The version was bumped from 0.3.2 to 0.3.3.

**More detail than official CVE description:**

Yes, the content provides significantly more detail than a typical CVE description. It includes the specific function involved, the parameter added to fix the issue, and the context of the vulnerability within the `llama_index` library.
