## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-0402 Content

The provided content **IS RELATED** to a vulnerability. It details a file upload vulnerability in the "reggie" application. Here's a breakdown of the information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The upload method in `src/main/java/com/itheima/reggie/controller/CommonController.java` only performs front-end validation on file suffixes. This means an attacker can bypass the intended file type restrictions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** Lack of robust server-side validation on uploaded files.
*   **File Upload Vulnerability:**  Allows arbitrary file uploads due to weak validation.

**Impact of exploitation:**

The vulnerability allows attackers to upload any file, potentially leading to:

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Uploading a malicious file (e.g., a JSP file containing code) and executing it on the server.
*   **Server Compromise:**  Gaining control of the server by uploading and executing malicious code.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:**  The attacker sends a crafted `POST` request to the `/common/upload` endpoint with a malicious file. The provided example shows a `POST` request with a `test.jsp` file containing code (`<% out.println("test"); %>`).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the application's `/common/upload` endpoint.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The provided example shows that no login is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Mitigation or fix:**

The content does not explicitly state a fix, but the implication is that server-side validation of file types and content is required. This should include:

*   **Whitelisting allowed file types:** Only allow specific, safe file extensions.
*   **Content inspection:** Verify the file content to ensure it matches the expected type.
*   **Secure storage:** Store uploaded files in a secure location with restricted access.

**Additional Details:**

The content provides more detail than a typical CVE description by including:

*   Specific file path of the vulnerable code (`src/main/java/com/itheima/reggie/controller/CommonController.java`).
*   A complete example of a malicious `POST` request.
*   Screenshots of the vulnerability report.
