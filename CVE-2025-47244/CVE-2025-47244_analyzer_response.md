# Raw Analyzer Response for CVE-2025-47244

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-470 | Use of Externally-Controlled Input to Select Classes or Code ('Unsafe Reflection') | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE: The application uses external input to select classes or code, which leads to unsafe reflection. |
| CWE-425 | Direct Request ('Forced Browsing') | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate: Due to potential CSRF, direct requests to restricted functionalities might be possible. |
| CWE-306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate: Exploitation is easier when anonymous access is enabled. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is CWE-470, which is a base-level CWE describing the use of externally controlled input to select classes or code in an unsafe manner. This is directly related to the vulnerability description, which mentions the C# reflection layer being exploited. CWE-425 and CWE-306 are secondary considerations, relating to potential CSRF and missing authentication, respectively, which facilitate the exploitation. These are weaknesses that CanPrecede the primary weakness.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain begins with either missing authentication (CWE-306) or the possibility of a CSRF attack leading to direct requests (CWE-425). This leads to the core vulnerability of using externally-controlled input to select classes or code via C# reflection (CWE-470). The impact includes denial of service and information disclosure.

## Summary of Analysis
The primary assessment focuses on **the insecure use of the C# reflection layer**, which directly aligns with CWE-470. The supporting evidence is the "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" section indicating "**Root cause of vulnerability:** The information system directly exposes the C# reflection used during the request-action mapping process and fails to properly protect certain pathways." This evidence directly supports CWE-470. CWE-425 and CWE-306 are included as secondary because the vulnerability notes state "Exploitation can occur if Anonymous access is enabled, or if there is a successful CSRF attack". This suggests that these are enablers for the **unsafe reflection**.

The retriever results and graph relationships influenced the decision by reinforcing the potential relevance of CWE-470, while also suggesting other possibilities like path traversal or out-of-bounds read, which were not directly supported by the provided evidence.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-470 accurately describes the **root cause** of the vulnerability, while CWE-425 and CWE-306 highlight the conditions that facilitate exploitation.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names. The associated manipulations are intended to generate multiple names for the same object.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product establishes a communication channel to (or from) an endpoint for privileged or protected operations, but it does not properly ensure that it is communicating with the correct endpoint.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-346: Origin Validation Error
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly verify that the source of data or communication is valid.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged

## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.

**Mapping Guidance**:
