# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-7012
## Query
An authentication bypass vulnerability has been identified in Foreman when deployed with External Authentication, due to the puppet-foreman configuration. This issue arises from Apaches mod_proxy not properly unsetting headers because of restrictions on underscores in HTTP headers, allowing authentication through a malformed header. This flaw impacts all active Satellite deployments (6.13, 6.14 and 6.15) and could potentially enable unauthorized users to gain administrative access.

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: 'improper header unsetting in mod_proxy'
- **weakness**: 'authentication bypass'
