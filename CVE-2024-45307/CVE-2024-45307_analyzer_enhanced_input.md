## Vulnerability Description
SudoBot, a Discord moderation bot, is vulnerable to privilege escalation and exploit of the `-config` command in versions prior to 9.26.7. Anyone is theoretically able to update any configuration of the bot and potentially gain control over the bots settings. Every version of v9 before v9.26.7 is affected. Other versions (e.g. v8) are not affected. Users should upgrade to version 9.26.7 to receive a patch. A workaround would be to create a command permission overwrite in the Database. A SQL statement provided in the GitHub Security Advisor can be executed to create a overwrite that disallows users without `ManageGuild` permission to run the `-config` command. Run the SQL statement for every server the bot is in, and replace `` with the appropriate Guild ID each time.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** privilege escalation
- **vector:** -config command
- **attacker:** anyone
- **product:** SudoBot
- **version:** prior to 9.26.7

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content relates to CVE-2024-45307.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check in the `-config` command of the `sudobot`. This allows any user, regardless of their permissions, to execute the command and modify the bot's configuration.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper authorization: The `-config` command lacks a check to ensure that only authorized users (e.g., those with `ManageGuild` permissions) can execute it.
- Privilege escalation: Unauthorized users can modify the bot's configuration, potentially gaining control over the bot.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Privilege escalation: Attackers can gain control over the bot's settings by modifying the configuration.
-  The bot's functionality can be altered by changing configuration values.
-  Potential for other attacks depending on how the bot's configuration is utilized.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network: The attack vector is network-based, meaning that the attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need any privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to interact with the bot via the `-config` command.

**Additional information:**
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 9.26.7 of the bot. Users are advised to update to this version, or v10.
- A workaround using an SQL query that creates a command permission overwrite in the database is also provided as a temporary solution.
- The vulnerability has a high severity rating with a CVSS score of 8.8.
- The vulnerability has the following CVSS v3.1 vector: AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:H
- The related CWEs are CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) and CWE-862 (Missing Authorization).
- The provided commit `ef46ca9` fixes the vulnerability by adding a `PermissionFlags.ManageGuild` check to the command.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* 🔍 *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* 🔍 *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion – CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### 🔸 CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ✅ *“A user created with the ‘guest’ role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ✅ *“The backup service runs as root but only needs read access.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ⚠️ This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### 🔸 CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ✅ *“User can access another user’s invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.”*

## Mapping Examples – Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *“User can escalate privileges to admin.”*
> ❌ Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged – only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ✅ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**

| “Unauthorized read/write to file”           | Permission control issue              | CWE-285                                      |
| “Can access resource without correct role”  | Incorrect or missing permission check | CWE-285, 862, 863                            |

## Good Mapping Examples – Privileges & Permissions

* ✅ **CWE-266**: *“When a new user registers, the system assigns them admin role due to a missing role validation.”*
* ✅ **CWE-250**: *“Installer runs with system-level privileges but doesn't require them to install files in the user directory.”*
* ✅ **CWE-284**: *“Inconsistent access rules between UI and backend for sensitive endpoints.”*
* ✅ **CWE-285**: *“Authorization logic fails to restrict access to finance reports based on department.”*
