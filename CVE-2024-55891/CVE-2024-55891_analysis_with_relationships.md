# Enhanced Analysis for CVE-2024-55891

# Summary

| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-532 | Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-256 | Plaintext Storage of a Password | 0.8 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis

The primary relationship that influenced the decision was the child-of relationship between CWE-532 and CWE-200 (Information Exposure). CWE-532 is a more specific instance of information exposure where the sensitive information is leaked into a log file. CWE-256 is also related, as storing passwords in plaintext is a common way sensitive information ends up in logs.

## Vulnerability Chain

The vulnerability chain starts with an **incorrect password hashing mechanism**. This leads to the **install tool password being logged in plaintext**, ultimately resulting in **sensitive information exposure**.

Incorrect Hashing Mechanism -> Plaintext Password Logging (CWE-532) -> Information Exposure

## Summary of Analysis

The primary CWE identified is CWE-532 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File). This accurately reflects the vulnerability where the install tool password was logged as plaintext. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" explicitly states that "The install tool password was logged in plaintext", which strongly supports this classification. The impact is "Confidentiality: Low - Plaintext passwords could be exposed", reinforcing the selection of a CWE related to information exposure.

CWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password) was also considered, as the logging of the plaintext password implies that the password was available in plaintext at some point. However, CWE-532 is a more precise description of the actual vulnerability, which is the insertion of that plaintext password into a log file.

The retriever results also suggested CWE-209 (Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information). While this is related, CWE-532 is more specific because it identifies where the sensitive information is being exposed (i.e., the log file).

The final decision is primarily based on the vulnerability description and CVE summary, which clearly describe the logging of plaintext passwords.
