This is due to verification only being performed at the beginning of the routine allowing theuserspace to change page permissions half way through the routine. A valid workaround is a rule to detect unauthorized loading of winpmem outside incident response operations.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'Improper Input Validation'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1.
