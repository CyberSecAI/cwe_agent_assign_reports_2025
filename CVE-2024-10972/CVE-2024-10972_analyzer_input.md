# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-10972

# Vulnerability Description

    Velocidex WinPmem versions 4.1 and below suffer from an **Improper Input Validation** vulnerability whereby an attacker with admin access can trigger a BSODwith a parallel thread changing the memorys access right under the control of the user-mode application. This is due to verification only being performed at the beginning of the routine allowing theuserspace to change page permissions half way through the routine. A valid workaround is a rule to detect unauthorized loading of winpmem outside incident response operations.

    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis
    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. 
    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.

    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'Improper Input Validation'

Relevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:

### 1. CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition (Score: 437.65)

The product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check. This can cause the product to perform invalid actions when the resource is in an unexpected state....

The product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action....

### 4. CWE-1390: Weak Authentication (Score: 428.34)

The product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct....
