# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-10972

## Description

Velocidex WinPmem versions 4.1 and below suffer from an **Improper Input Validation** vulnerability whereby an attacker with admin access can trigger a BSODwith a parallel thread changing the memorys access right under the control of the user-mode application. This is due to verification only being performed at the beginning of the routine allowing theuserspace to change page permissions half way through the routine. A valid workaround is a rule to detect unauthorized loading of winpmem outside incident response operations.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Rootcause:** ['Improper Input Validation', 'Input Validation vulnerability']
- **Impact:** BSOD
- **Attacker:** attacker with admin access
- **Product:** Velocidex WinPmem
- **Version:** 4.1 and below

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-367 | Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE. The **improper input validation** is due to the resource's state changing between the check and the use, which is a **TOCTOU** race condition. |
| CWE-284 | Improper Access Control | 0.6 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary. An attacker with admin access is required to trigger the vulnerability, indicating a potential access control issue. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.75
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-367, which is a Base level CWE. CWE-367 is related to CWE-362 (Race Condition), which is a Class level CWE, through a ChildOf relationship. It is also related to CWE-667 (Improper Locking) which is a Class level CWE, as a CANPRECEDE relationship.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **improper input validation** due to a **TOCTOU** race condition (CWE-367). This allows an attacker with admin access to change memory access rights, leading to a BSOD. The requirement for admin access suggests a secondary issue of **improper access control** (CWE-284).

## Summary of Analysis
The primary weakness is **improper input validation** in the form of a **TOCTOU** race condition (CWE-367). The vulnerability description explicitly states that verification is performed only at the beginning of the routine, allowing userspace to change page permissions halfway through, leading to a BSOD. This directly matches the description of CWE-367. The fact that the attacker needs admin access hints that there might be other access control issues.

The choice of CWE-367 is at the Base level, providing more specific information than its parent class.

CWEs Considered but Not Used:

*   CWE-287 (Improper Authentication), CWE-285 (Improper Authorization), CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication), and CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) were considered but deemed less relevant because the core issue is not related to authentication or authorization, but rather the timing issue in input validation.
*   CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) was added as a secondary candidate, but not as the primary because **improper input validation** is the root cause of the vulnerability.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check. This can cause the product to perform invalid actions when the resource is in an unexpected state.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-657: Violation of Secure Design Principles

**Description**:
The product violates well-established principles for secure design.

**Mapping Guidance**:

**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions

**Description**:
The product does not properly anticipate or handle exceptional conditions that rarely occur during normal operation of the product.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.



## CWE-208: Observable Timing Discrepancy
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
Two separate operations in a product require different amounts of time to complete, in a way that is observable to an actor and reveals security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
