  "description": "GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. An OOB-read vulnerability has been identified in the gst_avi_subtitle_parse_gab2_chunk function within gstavisubtitle.c. The function reads the name_length value directly from the input file without checking it properly. Then, the a condition, does not properly handle cases where name_length is greater than 0xFFFFFFFF - 17, causing an **integer overflow**. In such scenario, the function attempts to access memory beyond the buffer leading to an OOB-read. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-47774\n\n**Root Cause:**\n- The vulnerability stems from an integer overflow vulnerability within the `gst_avi_subtitle_parse_gab2_chunk` function in `gstavisubtitle.c`.\n- The `name_length` is read from the input file without proper validation, leading to potential integer overflow when used in subsequent size checks.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n- **Integer Overflow:** The code calculates the required buffer size (`17 + name_length`) without checking for potential overflow, especially when `name_length` is close to the maximum value for a 32-bit unsigned integer.\n- **Out-of-Bounds Read:** The vulnerability allows for reading data beyond the allocated buffer size due to the overflowed size calculation and subsequent memory access attempts.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Application Crash:** The out-of-bounds read can cause the application using the GStreamer library to crash.\n- **Information Leak:** The vulnerability could also potentially lead to leaking memory contents, which could contain sensitive information.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Malicious AVI File:** An attacker could craft a malicious AVI file containing a large `name_length` value to trigger the integer overflow and out-of-bounds read in the affected function.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- The attacker needs the ability to supply a crafted AVI file containing a specific value for the `name_length` field.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n- The provided patch addresses the integer overflow issue by explicitly checking if the `name_length` value, when added to `17`, would result in a value greater than `G_MAXUINT32` before performing the buffer size comparison. This prevents out-of-bounds access by avoiding the overflow. The fix includes a similar check for the total length calculation as well (17 + name_length + file_length).",

This can lead to an **out-of-bounds read** (CWE-125) because the overflowed value is then used to access memory locations beyond the allocated buffer. CWE-190 can precede CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), and CWE-125 is a child of CWE-119. This indicates a hierarchical relationship where the integer overflow results in a memory safety issue.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe190[\"CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\"]\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    \n    cwe125 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe190 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe190 primary\n    class cwe125,cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with:\n1.  **Integer Overflow** (CWE-190): The `name_length` value, read from the input file, is not properly checked, leading to a potential integer overflow when used in buffer size calculations.\n2.  **Out-of-bounds Read** (CWE-125): Due to the integer overflow, the code attempts to read memory beyond the allocated buffer, leading to an out-of-bounds read.\nThe chain clearly shows the progression from the initial **flaw** (integer overflow) to the resulting **impact** (out-of-bounds read).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe primary assessment is based on the provided evidence, which indicates an integer overflow vulnerability that leads to an out-of-bounds read. The description states that the `name_length` value is read from the input file without proper validation, leading to an **integer overflow**. \"Then, the a condition, does not properly handle cases where name_length is greater than 0xFFFFFFFF - 17, causing an **integer overflow**. In such scenario, the function attempts to access memory beyond the buffer leading to an OOB-read.\"\nThe relationship graph reinforces the connection between CWE-190 and CWE-125, with CWE-190 preceding CWE-119 and CWE-125 being a child of CWE-119. This suggests that the integer overflow is the root cause, and the out-of-bounds read is a consequence of it.
