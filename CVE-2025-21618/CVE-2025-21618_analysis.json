  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-21618 based on provided content:\n\nThe provided content is directly related to CVE-2025-21618. It provides significantly more detail than a placeholder CVE description would.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from an authentication issue in NiceGUI On Air, where logging in on one browser automatically logs the user into all other browsers, including incognito mode, without requiring a password.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Insecure session management.\n*   Lack of proper session isolation between browsers.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nHigh impact, allowing unauthorized access to the application for anyone who gains access to a logged-in browser session.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   An attacker gaining access to a single logged-in browser session can effectively bypass authentication for all other sessions.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   The attacker needs access to a single browser session where a user is already authenticated. No special privileges or user interaction are required beyond that initial access.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   Upgrade to version 2.9.1 or later of the `nicegui` package. The commit referenced (1621a4b) clears client cookies after each response, which appears to be the fix.\n\n**Additional details:**\n\n*   **CVSS Score:** 7.5 (High)\n*   **CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N\n*   **Affected versions:** <=2.9.0\n*   **Patched versions:** 2.9.1\n*   **Credits:** streamcfd (Reporter), rodja (Remediation developer)",

CWE-288 (Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel) and CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication) were considered as secondary candidates. CWE-288 implies the existence of an authentication mechanism, but it can be bypassed. CWE-1390 is a more general class of weakness.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe288[\"CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n\n    cwe288 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1390\n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe288 -->|PEEROF| cwe306\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe306 primary\n    class cwe288,cwe1390 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authentication** (**CWE-306**), leading to the impact of unauthorized access to the application because logging in on one browser automatically logs the user into all other browsers, including incognito mode.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary vulnerability is the **lack of authentication** for critical functions, as evidenced by the description of the vulnerability where logging in one browser logs in the user for all browsers, including incognito mode. This directly matches the definition of CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function. The fix implemented (clearing client cookies after each response) further supports this as it enforces authentication per session.\n\nCWE-288 and CWE-1390 were also considered. CWE-288 (Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel) was considered because the described behavior suggests a bypass, but the fundamental issue is the **absence of authentication** rather than a bypass of an existing mechanism. CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication) is a more general category and less precise than CWE-306.\n\nThe decision to select CWE-306 is based on the clear evidence of **missing authentication** as the root cause, the direct match with the CWE description, and the nature of the implemented fix.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-451: User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe user interface (UI) does not properly represent critical information to the user, allowing the information - or its source - to be obscured or spoofed.
