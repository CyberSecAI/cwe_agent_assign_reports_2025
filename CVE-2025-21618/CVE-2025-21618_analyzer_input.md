## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-21618 based on provided content:

The provided content is directly related to CVE-2025-21618. It provides significantly more detail than a placeholder CVE description would.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an authentication issue in NiceGUI On Air, where logging in on one browser automatically logs the user into all other browsers, including incognito mode, without requiring a password.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Insecure session management.
*   Lack of proper session isolation between browsers.

**Impact of exploitation:**

High impact, allowing unauthorized access to the application for anyone who gains access to a logged-in browser session.

**Attack vectors:**

*   An attacker gaining access to a single logged-in browser session can effectively bypass authentication for all other sessions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs access to a single browser session where a user is already authenticated. No special privileges or user interaction are required beyond that initial access.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   Upgrade to version 2.9.1 or later of the `nicegui` package. The commit referenced (1621a4b) clears client cookies after each response, which appears to be the fix.

**Additional details:**

*   **CVSS Score:** 7.5 (High)
*   **CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N
