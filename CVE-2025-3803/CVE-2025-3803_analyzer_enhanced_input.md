## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability was found in Tenda W12 and i24 3.0.0.4(2887)/3.0.0.5(3644). It has been rated as critical. This issue affects the function cgiSysScheduleRebootSet of the file /bin/httpd. The manipulation of the argument rebootDate leads to **stack-based buffer overflow**. The attack may be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **component:** cgiSysScheduleRebootSet function of /bin/httpd
- **vector:** manipulation of the argument rebootDate
- **weakness:** **stack-based buffer overflow**
- **product:** Tenda W12, i24
- **version:** 3.0.0.4(2887)/3.0.0.5(3644)

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-3803 related content

Based on the provided content, specifically the GitHub issue description, here's an extraction of relevant information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The `rebootDate` parameter in the `cgiSysScheduleRebootSet` function does not have length limitations, leading to a stack overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Stack overflow vulnerability
*   Lack of input validation on the `rebootDate` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**

The stack overflow allows modification of the `$RA` register, which can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE).

**Attack vectors:**

*   Network-based attack via HTTP POST request to the `/goform/modules` endpoint.
*   Specifically targeting the `sysScheduleRebootSet` parameter with a crafted, overly long `rebootDate` value.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   Network access to the affected Tenda device.
*   Ability to send HTTP POST requests.
*   Understanding of stack overflow exploitation techniques.

**Mitigation or fix:**

The content does not provide information about a specific fix or mitigation. However, the root cause suggests that proper input validation and length checking of the `rebootDate` parameter would resolve the vulnerability.

**Affected Firmware:**

*   Tenda w12 V3.0.0.5(3644)
*   Tenda i24 V3.0.0.4(2887)

**Additional Details (more detail than official CVE description):**

The provided content includes a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit script in Python, demonstrating how to trigger the stack overflow and potentially achieve RCE. It also includes images illustrating the normal state and the overflow condition.
