The commit 3a5a6d0c2b03 (cpuset dont nest cgroup_mutex inside get_online_cpus()) made cpuset_hotplug_workfn asynchronous, This change involves calling flush_work(), which can create a multiple processes circular locking dependency that involve cgroup_mutex, potentially leading to a deadlock. To avoid deadlock. the commit 76bb5ab8f6e3 (cpuset break kernfs active protection in cpuset_write_resmask()) added kernfs_break_active_protection in the cpuset_write_resmask. This could lead to this warning. After the commit 2125c0034c5d (cgroup/cpuset Make cpuset hotplug processing synchronous), the cpuset_write_resmask no longer needs to wait the hotplug to finish, which means that concurrent hotplug and cpuset operations are no longer possible. Therefore, the deadlock doesnt exist anymore and it does not have to break active protection now. To fix this warning, just remove kernfs_break_active_protection operation in the cpuset_write_resmask.",
