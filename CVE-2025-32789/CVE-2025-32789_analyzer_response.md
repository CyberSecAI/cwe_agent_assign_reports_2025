# Raw Analyzer Response for CVE-2025-32789

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-201 | Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data | 0.75 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE: The primary weakness is that sorting by password hash allows an attacker to infer information about other user's passwords. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.75
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship considered was the parent-child relationship, particularly concerning abstraction levels. The goal was to find the most specific CWE that accurately represented the vulnerability. The retriever results suggested several Class-level CWEs related to weak authentication and credential protection, but the specific issue of leaking information through sorting led to the selection of CWE-201. The graph relationships primarily highlighted potential follow-on weaknesses (CanFollow), which were considered but not deemed primary to the initial weakness.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **insecure** implementation that allows sorting by password hash, leading to the disclosure of sensitive information (relative order of hashes), which could potentially lead to account takeover if an attacker can crack the revealed hashes.
  - Root Cause: **Insecure** sorting implementation.
  - Weakness: Information leakage through sorting by password hash.
  - Impact: Potential account takeover.

## Summary of Analysis
Initially, the analysis considered CWEs related to weak authentication and password hashing, as suggested by the retriever results. However, the core issue is the disclosure of sensitive information through the ability to sort users by their password hash. This makes CWE-201 a more accurate fit. The evidence for this is the vulnerability description stating, "users can be sorted by their password hash. This flaw allows an attacker to make assumptions about the hash values of other users stored in the password column of the user table, based on the results of the sorted list of users."

The final decision to use CWE-201 is based on its specific focus on the **insertion** of sensitive information into sent data. In this case, the "sent data" is the sorted list of users, and the sensitive information is the relative order of their password hashes. This aligns well with the CWE's description. The level of specificity is appropriate because it directly addresses the information leakage aspect of the vulnerability.
