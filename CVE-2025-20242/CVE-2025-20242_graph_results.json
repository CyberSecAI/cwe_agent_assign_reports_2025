  "query": "A vulnerability in the Cloud Connect component of Cisco Unified Contact Center Enterprise (CCE) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to read and modify data on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to a lack of proper authentication controls. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted TCP data to a specific port on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read or modify data on the affected device.",
