The **root cause** is the **insufficient data validation**, which is CWE-20.\n\nThe retriever results also list CWE-787 with a relatively high score (0.574), supporting this classification.\n\nCWE-416 (Use After Free) was considered due to its presence in the retriever results, but it does not accurately describe the vulnerability. The vulnerability is triggered by writing to an unauthorized memory location, not using memory after it has been freed.\n\nCWE-843 (Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')) was also considered, but it does not fit the description as the issue is not related to type confusion.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity.
