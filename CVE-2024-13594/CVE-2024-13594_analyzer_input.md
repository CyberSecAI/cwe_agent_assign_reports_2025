# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-13594

## Vulnerability Description
The Simple Downloads List plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to **SQL Injection** via the category attribute of the neofix_sdl shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.2 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.

Specifically, unsanitized input can be used to manipulate the query, potentially leading to unauthorized access or data modification.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthorized access or data modification.
*   **Attack vectors:** Exploitation can be achieved by passing malicious parameters to the vulnerable shortcode.
