It primarily consists of release notes for Okta Advanced Server Access, along with navigation links. It does mention a fix in the release: 1.87.1, specifically:\n\n**Issue:**\n*   The `sft-gatewayd.sample.yaml` file had an invalid quote (\") in the `ListenAddress` parameter.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n*  The root cause is a syntax error in the default configuration file (`sft-gatewayd.sample.yaml`) of the Okta Advanced Server Access gateway, where an invalid quote character was used in the `ListenAddress` parameter.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n*  A malformed configuration file can lead to parsing errors or unexpected behavior of the affected software.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n*  The specific impact is not detailed but, a misconfigured `ListenAddress` may lead to the service not starting or potentially exposing the service on unintended interfaces.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n*  Not a vulnerability that could be directly exploited, but the error may lead to issues when a user applies the sample config file without proper review.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n*   The issue appears to be a configuration error rather than a direct exploit. An attacker could not take advantage of this directly but may find it useful during the course of exploitation if they have knowledge about this configuration file and its impact on the system.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe document does not describe the vulnerability described by CVE-2024-9875. However it does mention a vulnerability of a malformed configuration file. This configuration error in the `sft-gatewayd.sample.yaml` file which contained an invalid quote in the ListenAddress parameter. This error could lead to parsing problems or unexpected behaviour of the service and has been resolved in version 1.87.1.",

CWE-266 (Incorrect Privilege Assignment) is chosen as the root cause. CWE-267 (Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions) and CWE-250 (Execution with Unnecessary Privileges) are considered as potential related weaknesses.
