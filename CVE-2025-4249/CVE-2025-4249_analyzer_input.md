## Analysis of CVE-2025-4249 Content

This content **IS RELATED** to a vulnerability report. It details a SQL injection vulnerability in Phpgurukul e-Diary Management System V1.0.

Here's a breakdown of the extracted information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the direct use of the "id" parameter in an SQL query without proper sanitization or validation. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   SQL Injection

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Unauthorized database access
*   Sensitive data leakage
*   Data tampering
*   System control
*   Service interruption

**Attack vectors:**

*   The `/manage-categories.php` file is vulnerable.
*   The "id" parameter is the entry point for the attack.
*   No login or authorization is required.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   No authentication is required, making it easily exploitable.
*   Basic understanding of SQL injection techniques.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   **Use prepared statements and parameter binding:** This separates SQL code from user input.
*   **Input validation and filtering:**  Ensure user input conforms to expected formats.
*   **Minimize database user permissions:** Use accounts with the least necessary privileges.
*   **Regular security audits:**  Proactively identify and fix vulnerabilities.

**Payload Example:**

```
GET /edms/manage-categories.php?del=1&id=1%27and%20(updatexml(1,concat(0x7e,(select+database())),1))%23 HTTP/1.1
```

**Additional Details (More than official CVE description):**

*   Specific file and parameter involved (`/manage-categories.php`, `id` parameter).
*   A proof-of-concept (POC) payload is provided.
*   A screenshot demonstrating data retrieval via the POC is included.
*   Vendor information and software link are provided.
*   The report details the vulnerability was discovered during a security review.
