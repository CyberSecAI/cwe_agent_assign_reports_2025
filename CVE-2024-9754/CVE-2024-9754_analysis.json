  "description": "Tungsten Automation Power PDF PDF File Parsing **Out-Of-Bounds Read** **Information Disclosure Vulnerability**. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Tungsten Automation Power PDF. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of PDF files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated object. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-24471.",

CWE-20 is related because **lack of proper validation** is a common cause for out-of-bounds access. CWE-125 is a base CWE, providing a good level of detail.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n\n    cwe125 -->|CAUSES| cwe20\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe125 primary\n    class cwe20 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Lack of proper validation of user-supplied data** (CWE-20)\n2.  **Weakness:** Resulting in an **Out-Of-Bounds Read** during PDF file parsing (CWE-125).\n3.  **Impact:** **Information Disclosure** and potential for arbitrary code execution if chained with other vulnerabilities.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the primary weakness, which is the **out-of-bounds read** during PDF file parsing, leading to information disclosure. The vulnerability description clearly states, \"The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated object.\" This directly points to CWE-125 as the primary CWE, with CWE-20 as a contributing factor.\n\nThe relationship graph shows CWE-125 as the primary issue, caused by CWE-20. This aligns with the description, where improper input validation leads to the out-of-bounds read.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-125 being a Base CWE, providing a detailed description of the vulnerability, and CWE-20 being a Class CWE, representing the general **improper input validation** issue.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected:* This is related to buffer overflows, but the primary issue is an out-of-bounds read, not an incorrect buffer size calculation.\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected:* While information disclosure is an impact, the root cause is the out-of-bounds read, making CWE-125 more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Selected as Primary CWE:* This perfectly matches the vulnerability description, \"The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated object.\"\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected:* While this relates to untrusted inputs, the core issue is the out-of-bounds read resulting from the **lack of validation**, making CWE-125 and CWE-20 more fitting.\n\n## CWE-788: Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads or writes to a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location after the end of the buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: The CWE entry might be misused when lower-level CWE entries might be available. It also overlaps existing CWE entries and might be deprecated in the future.\n\n*Not Selected:* This is similar to CWE-125, but CWE-125 is a more direct and preferred mapping for an out-of-bounds read.\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).

CWE-20 is related because **lack of proper validation** is a common cause for out-of-bounds access. CWE-125 is a base CWE, providing a good level of detail.mermaid\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n\n    cwe125 -->|CAUSES| cwe20\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe125 primary\n    class cwe20 secondary\n\n```\n\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Lack of proper validation of user-supplied data** (CWE-20)\n2.  **Weakness:** Resulting in an **Out-Of-Bounds Read** during PDF file parsing (CWE-125).\n3.  **Impact:** **Information Disclosure** and potential for arbitrary code execution if chained with other vulnerabilities.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the primary weakness, which is the **out-of-bounds read** during PDF file parsing, leading to information disclosure. The vulnerability description clearly states, \"The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated object.\" This directly points to CWE-125 as the primary CWE, with CWE-20 as a contributing factor.\n\nThe relationship graph shows CWE-125 as the primary issue, caused by CWE-20. This aligns with the description, where improper input validation leads to the out-of-bounds read.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-125 being a Base CWE, providing a detailed description of the vulnerability, and CWE-20 being a Class CWE, representing the general **improper input validation** issue.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected:* This is related to buffer overflows, but the primary issue is an out-of-bounds read, not an incorrect buffer size calculation.\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected:* While information disclosure is an impact, the root cause is the out-of-bounds read, making CWE-125 more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Selected as Primary CWE:* This perfectly matches the vulnerability description, \"The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated object.\"\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected:* While this relates to untrusted inputs, the core issue is the out-of-bounds read resulting from the **lack of validation**, making CWE-125 and CWE-20 more fitting.\n\n## CWE-788: Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads or writes to a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location after the end of the buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: The CWE entry might be misused when lower-level CWE entries might be available. It also overlaps existing CWE entries and might be deprecated in the future.\n\n*Not Selected:* This is similar to CWE-125, but CWE-125 is a more direct and preferred mapping for an out-of-bounds read.\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
