This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Tungsten Automation Power PDF. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of PDF files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated object. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-24471.', key_phrases={'rootcause': 'lack of proper validation of user-supplied data', 'weakness': ['Information Disclosure Vulnerability', 'Out-Of-Bounds Read'], 'impact': ['Information Disclosure', 'disclose sensitive information', 'execute arbitrary code'], 'vector': 'malicious page or file', 'attacker': 'remote attackers', 'product': 'Tungsten Automation Power PDF', 'version': '', 'component': 'PDF file parsing'}, reference_content='Based on the provided advisory, here\\'s a breakdown of the vulnerability:\\n\\n**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the improper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of PDF files within Tungsten Automation Power PDF. This lack of validation leads to a read operation beyond the boundaries of an allocated object.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\\n*   **Out-of-bounds Read:** The core issue is an out-of-bounds read, where the software attempts to access memory outside the allocated buffer.\\n*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The software doesn\\'t properly validate user-provided data when parsing PDF files.\\n\\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\\n*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can potentially disclose sensitive information due to the out-of-bounds read.\\n*   **Potential Code Execution:** The advisory mentions that this vulnerability could be leveraged in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to achieve arbitrary code execution in the context of the current process.\\n\\n**Attack Vectors:**\\n*   **Malicious PDF Files:** An attacker can craft a malicious PDF file that triggers the out-of-bounds read when opened by the vulnerable software.\\n*   **Malicious Pages:** The advisory mentions a malicious page, possibly meaning a website that attempts to force the vulnerable application to open the malicious PDF.\\n\\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\\n*   **User Interaction:** Exploitation requires user interaction. The target user must either open a malicious PDF file or visit a malicious page that causes the application to process the malicious file.\\n*   **Local Access:** The CVSS vector indicates \"AV:L\", meaning Local attack vector.\\n\\n**Additional Notes:**\\n*   The vulnerability is fixed in version 5.1 of Tungsten Automation Power PDF.\\n*   The advisory was released on October 11, 2024, and the vulnerability was reported to the vendor on June 13, 2024.\\n*   The researcher who discovered the vulnerability is Mat Powell of Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative.', similar_info={'cwe_distribution':

    "enhanced_query": "# Vulnerability Description\n\n    Tungsten Automation Power PDF PDF File Parsing **Out-Of-Bounds Read** **Information Disclosure Vulnerability**. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Tungsten Automation Power PDF. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of PDF files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated object. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-24471.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'lack of proper validation of user-supplied data'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1.
