# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-11734

## Description

A **denial of service vulnerability** was found in Keycloak that could allow an administrative user with the right to change realm settings to disrupt the service. This action is done by modifying any of the security headers and inserting newlines, which causes the Keycloak server to write to a request that has already been terminated, leading to the failure of said request.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Weakness:** denial of service vulnerability
- **Impact:** disrupt the service
- **Vector:** modifying security headers and inserting newlines
- **Attacker:** administrative user with right to change realm settings
- **Product:** Keycloak

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis

The primary CWE is CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling), which is a base-level CWE. CWE-770 is a child of CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption), which means that the vulnerability can be seen as a specific case of uncontrolled resource consumption due to missing limits or throttling when allocating resources.

```

## Vulnerability Chain

The vulnerability chain starts with an administrative user **modifying security headers and inserting newlines**, which then leads to **uncontrolled allocation of resources** because of a **lack of limits or throttling (CWE-770)**, eventually resulting in a **denial-of-service (DoS) (CWE-400)**.

## Summary of Analysis

Initially, the vulnerability description points to a **denial of service vulnerability**. Analyzing the provided information, especially the description stating that **modifying security headers and inserting newlines** causes the Keycloak server to write to a terminated request, leading to the failure of said request. This indicates a resource allocation issue where the system doesn't properly handle or limit the resources allocated for these requests, leading to a **denial of service**.

The **Retriever Results** list CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) as a potential candidate, which aligns well with the vulnerability description. CWE-770 is a base-level CWE, which is preferred. The description matches the scenario where the product allocates resources without proper limits, leading to resource exhaustion and denial of service.

CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) is considered as a secondary CWE because it represents the impact of the vulnerability which is a **denial of service**.

The final assessment is based on the evidence provided, the relationships between the CWEs, and the mapping guidance.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)

## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected*: This CWE doesn't fit the description as the vulnerability is not related to authorization bypass.

## CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product establishes a communication channel to (or from) an endpoint for privileged or protected operations, but it does not properly ensure that it is communicating with the correct endpoint.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

*Not Selected*: This CWE does not fit because the vulnerability is not about communication channel restriction.

## CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web server receives a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected*: This CWE doesn't fit the description, as the vulnerability is not about SSRF.

## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

*Not Selected*: This CWE is not applicable as the vulnerability is not about weak credentials.

## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.

*Not Selected*: Although the attack vector involves modifying security headers, it doesn't clearly involve injection in the traditional sense.

## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected*: This CWE is not applicable as the vulnerability is not about privilege definition.

## CWE-610: Externally Controlled Reference to a Resource in Another Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses an externally controlled name or reference that resolves to a resource that is outside of the intended control sphere.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate

*Not Selected*: This CWE is not related to the described vulnerability.

## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.

*Not Selected*: This CWE is not related to the described vulnerability.

## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected*: This CWE doesn't directly describe the root cause, which is more related to resource management.

## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly
