### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **command injection**
- **product:** DCME-320
- **version:** v7.4.12.90

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-51115

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a command injection vulnerability in the DCME-320 gateway's web management interface. The application takes user-controlled input in the `type` and `app` parameters without proper sanitization and uses these to construct shell commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The application constructs shell commands using user-supplied input without proper escaping or validation of special characters. Specifically, the `type` parameter influences the execution path, leading to vulnerable code in `ip_inter` (case 1) and `app_ip` (case 5). The `app` parameter is then directly injected into the command.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** User input passed via the `type` and `app` parameters is not sanitized before being used in shell commands. This allows for injection of malicious commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary shell commands on the affected device.
- **Device Control:** Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to fully control the device.
- **Data Breach:** Accessing sensitive data could be a possible outcome of gaining control of the device through command injection.
- **Denial of Service:** Attacker could cause a denial of service on the device by executing resource-intensive commands.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable endpoint `/function/audit/newstatistics/ip_inter.php`.
- **URL Parameters:** The parameters `type` and `app` in the URL are used to inject malicious commands.
- **Web Interface:** The attack is carried out by manipulating the web interface of the device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web management interface of the DCME-320 device.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the location and parameters of the vulnerable API endpoint
- **Basic understanding of shell commands:** The attacker needs to know how to craft malicious commands that the device will execute.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided proof-of-concept (POC) demonstrates a successful command injection by setting `type=5` and injecting a command into the `app` parameter:
    ```
    https://ip/function/audit/newstatistics/ip_inter.php?type=5&app=;echo 123 > 1.txt;
    ```
    This POC will create a file named "1.txt" with the content "123" on the device.
- The vulnerability exists in version `v7.4.12.90`.
- The analysis identifies two vulnerable code paths based on the `type` parameter: `ip_inter` (case 1) and `app_ip` (case 5).

The content provides more detail than a typical CVE description would, including the specific vulnerable code paths and a working POC.
