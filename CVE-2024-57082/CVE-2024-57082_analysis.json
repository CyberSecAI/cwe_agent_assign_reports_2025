Specifically, it allows an attacker to manipulate the `Object.prototype` through a crafted JSON payload.\n\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities present:\n- Prototype Pollution: The application is vulnerable to prototype pollution, allowing modification of the global prototype chain.\n\nImpact of exploitation:\n- Denial of Service (DoS): At a minimum, the vulnerability can cause a denial of service.\n- Potential for Injection-based Attacks: If the polluted property propagates to sensitive Node.js APIs (e.g., exec, eval), it could enable arbitrary command execution.\n\nAttack vectors:\n- Supply a crafted JSON payload with an `Object.prototype` setter to the `lib.createUploader` function.\n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position:\n- The attacker needs to be able to control the input provided to the `lib.createUploader` function.\n\nMitigation or fix:\nThe advisory does not specify a fix, but suggests input validation and sanitization to prevent manipulation of the prototype chain.\n\nThe content is relevant to a potential vulnerability in the `@rpldy/uploader` package. It provides more detail than a typical CVE description, including a Proof of Concept (PoC).",

CWE-1321 is a Variant of higher-level Class CWEs, providing a more specific classification. CWE-471 was considered as a potential follow-up to CWE-1321 since prototype pollution can lead to the modification of assumed-immutable data, but the evidence is not strong enough to support it as a primary or strong secondary mapping.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1321[\"CWE-1321: Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')\"]\n    cwe471[\"CWE-471: Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID)\"]\n    cwe913[\"CWE-913: Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources\"]\n    cwe915[\"CWE-915: Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Managed Code Attributes\"]\n    \n    cwe1321 -->|CHILDOF| cwe913\n    cwe1321 -->|CHILDOF| cwe915\n    cwe1321 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe471\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1321 primary\n    class cwe471 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')** (CWE-1321) due to the lack of input validation. This leads to a Denial of Service (DoS) because the attacker can manipulate the `Object.prototype` through a crafted JSON payload. While the potential exists for further exploitation such as arbitrary command execution, the description primarily focuses on the DoS impact, so the chain is relatively short.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment strongly points to CWE-1321 as the primary weakness, based on the vulnerability description and CVE reference links. The description clearly states \"**prototype pollution**\" as the root cause, and the reference links confirm this by mentioning the lack of proper input validation when handling user-supplied data, allowing attackers to manipulate the `Object.prototype`. The retriever results also list CWE-1321 with a high similarity score.\nThe decision to select CWE-1321 is based on the direct evidence from the vulnerability description and the CVE reference links, which explicitly mention \"**prototype pollution**\" as the root cause. The relationships highlight that CWE-1321 is a variant-level CWE, providing a specific classification for the vulnerability. The MITRE mapping guidance allows the usage of CWE-1321, further supporting the decision. CWE-1321 is at the optimal level of specificity because it accurately represents the weakness described in the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1321: Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component that specifies attributes that are to be initialized or updated in an object, but it does not properly control modifications of attributes of the object prototype.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
