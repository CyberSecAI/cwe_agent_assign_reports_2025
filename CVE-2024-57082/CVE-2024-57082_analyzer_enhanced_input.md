## Vulnerability Description
A **prototype pollution** in the lib.createUploader function of @rpldy/uploader v1.8.1 allows attackers to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) via supplying a crafted payload.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **prototype pollution**
- **impact:** Denial of Service (DoS)
- **vector:** crafted payload
- **attacker:** attackers
- **product:** @rpldy/uploader
- **version:** v1.8.1
- **component:** lib.createUploader function

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper input validation when handling user-supplied data in the `lib.createUploader` function. Specifically, it allows an attacker to manipulate the `Object.prototype` through a crafted JSON payload.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Prototype Pollution: The application is vulnerable to prototype pollution, allowing modification of the global prototype chain.

Impact of exploitation:
- Denial of Service (DoS): At a minimum, the vulnerability can cause a denial of service.
- Potential for Injection-based Attacks: If the polluted property propagates to sensitive Node.js APIs (e.g., exec, eval), it could enable arbitrary command execution.

Attack vectors:
- Supply a crafted JSON payload with an `Object.prototype` setter to the `lib.createUploader` function.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker needs to be able to control the input provided to the `lib.createUploader` function.

Mitigation or fix:
The advisory does not specify a fix, but suggests input validation and sanitization to prevent manipulation of the prototype chain.

The content is relevant to a potential vulnerability in the `@rpldy/uploader` package. It provides more detail than a typical CVE description, including a Proof of Concept (PoC).
