  "query": "A vulnerability has been found in D-Link DWR-M961 1.1.36 and classified as critical. This vulnerability affects unknown code of the file /boafrm/formStaticDHCP of the component Authorization Interface. The manipulation of the argument Hostname leads to stack-based buffer overflow. The attack can be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. Upgrading to version 1.1.49 is able to address this issue. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component.",
