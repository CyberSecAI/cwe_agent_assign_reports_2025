# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-45982

## Vulnerability Description
A **host header injection** vulnerability in scheduleR v0.0.18 allows attackers to obtain the password reset token via user interaction with a crafted password reset link. This allows attackers to arbitrarily reset other users passwords and compromise their accounts.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **host header injection**
- **impact:** obtain password reset token and reset other users passwords
- **vector:** crafted password reset link
- **attacker:** attackers
- **product:** scheduleR
- **version:** v0.0.18

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of proper validation of the `Host` header in the forgot password functionality of scheduleR v0.0.18. The application uses the provided `Host` header value directly when generating password reset links, instead of relying on a configured or trusted source.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Host Header Injection:** The application is vulnerable to host header injection because it uses the `Host` header from the HTTP request to construct the password reset link without sanitization or validation.
- **Insecure Password Reset Link Generation:** The application constructs the password reset link based on user-provided input (the crafted host header) rather than using a configured or trusted source.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Password Reset Token Leakage:** By manipulating the `Host` header, an attacker can cause the password reset link in the email to point to an attacker-controlled server. When the victim clicks the link, the password reset token is sent to the attacker's server, exposing it to the attacker.
- **Account Takeover:** With the stolen reset token, the attacker can then reset the victim's password and gain control of their account.
- **Phishing:** The attacker can use the attacker-controlled server to mimic the application's reset password page and steal the victim's credentials, if they attempt to re-use a password.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attack is carried out by crafting a HTTP request to the forgot password endpoint with a malicious `Host` header.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- **Existing User:** The attacker needs an email that matches an existing user in the application to trigger the reset functionality and send the email.
