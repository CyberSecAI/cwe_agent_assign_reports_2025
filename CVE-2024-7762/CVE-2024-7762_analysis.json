CWE-548 is a variant that directly addresses the issue of exposing directory listings, making it more specific than its parent classes. Additionally, there's a potential connection to CWE-862 (Missing Authorization), as the lack of authorization could be the root cause of the directory listing exposure.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe548[\"CWE-548: Exposure of Information Through Directory Listing\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n\n    cwe548 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe862 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe548\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe548 primary\n    class cwe862 secondary\n    class cwe200 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **failure to prevent uploaded files from being listed** which leads to **exposure of sensitive information through directory listing**, ultimately resulting in **unauthenticated users accessing and downloading uploaded resumes**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is primarily based on the provided evidence, which explicitly states that the plugin \"does not prevent uploaded files from being listed.\" This directly corresponds to CWE-548 (Exposure of Information Through Directory Listing). The vulnerability allows unauthenticated users to access and download resumes, indicating a clear exposure of sensitive information. The relationship analysis highlights that CWE-548 is a specific variant of information exposure, making it the most appropriate choice.\n\nCWE-862 (Missing Authorization) was also considered, as the **lack of authorization** may be the underlying cause. However, the description focuses on the directory listing itself, making CWE-548 the primary weakness. CWE-200 is a parent of CWE-548 but too general.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n##
