# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-41722

## Vulnerability Description
In the goTenna Pro ATAK Plugin there is a vulnerability that makes it possible to inject any custom message with any GID and Callsign using a software defined radio in existing goTenna mesh networks. This vulnerability can be exploited if the device is being used in an unencrypted environment or if the cryptography has already been compromised. It is advised to use encryption shared with local QR code for higher security operations.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** inject custom message with GID and Callsign
- **vector:** software defined radio
- **product:** goTenna Pro ATAK Plugin

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2024-41722:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The goTenna Pro ATAK Plugin has a weak authentication mechanism.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- It's possible to inject custom messages with any Group ID (GID) and callsign into existing goTenna mesh networks using a software-defined radio.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject arbitrary messages.
- If encryption is not used, or if the encryption has been compromised, the attacker can spoof messages and potentially disrupt communication or insert false information.
- This compromise can impact the confidentiality of the communication by injecting messages.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Exploitation requires adjacent network access.
- An attacker needs a software-defined radio to inject the malicious messages.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be within range of the goTenna mesh network.
- The attacker needs to possess a software-defined radio and knowledge to craft and inject messages.
- The vulnerability can be exploited if the device is being used in an unencrypted environment or if the cryptography has already been compromised.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in goTenna Pro ATAK Plugin versions 1.9.12 and prior.
- The advisory recommends using encryption shared via local QR code for higher security.
- This vulnerability is listed as CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication).
