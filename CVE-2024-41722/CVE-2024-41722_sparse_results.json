  "query": "In the goTenna Pro ATAK Plugin there is a vulnerability that makes it possible to inject any custom message with any GID and Callsign using a software defined radio in existing goTenna mesh networks. This vulnerability can be exploited if the device is being used in an unencrypted environment or if the cryptography has already been compromised. It is advised to use encryption shared with local QR code for higher security operations.",
