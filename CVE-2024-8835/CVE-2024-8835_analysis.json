  "description": "PDF-XChange Editor JB2 File Parsing **Out-Of-Bounds Read** **Information Disclosure Vulnerability**. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of PDF-XChange Editor. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of JB2 files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated object. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-24320.",

This allows a read past the end of an allocated object.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- Out-of-bounds read vulnerability due to insufficient data validation in the JB2 file parsing module.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- Information disclosure: An attacker can read sensitive information from the application's memory.\n- This vulnerability can be combined with other vulnerabilities to potentially achieve arbitrary code execution within the context of the current process.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- Remote exploitation: Attackers can deliver malicious JB2 files to the victim.\n- User interaction is required: The user must either visit a malicious page or open a malicious file containing the crafted JB2 data.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- The attacker needs to be able to provide the victim with a malicious JB2 file or convince them to visit a page serving such a file.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n- The vulnerability is fixed in version 10.3.1.387 of PDF-XChange Editor.\n- The vulnerability was reported to the vendor on 2024-06-06 and publicly disclosed on 2024-09-17.",

This can occur because of **Improper Input Validation** (CWE-20), where the application does not properly check the size or boundaries of the input data, leading to a read operation outside the allocated buffer. CWE-125 is a base CWE, while CWE-20 is a class CWE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    \n    cwe125 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe125 primary\n    class cwe20 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **Improper Input Validation** (CWE-20), where the application **fails to validate user-supplied data**. This **lack of validation** allows for an **Out-of-bounds Read** (CWE-125) when parsing JB2 files. The impact of this **Out-of-bounds Read** is **information disclosure**, and it could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution if combined with other vulnerabilities.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-125 **Out-of-bounds Read**, as the vulnerability description explicitly states \"PDF-XChange Editor JB2 File Parsing **Out-Of-Bounds Read** **Information Disclosure Vulnerability**\". The **root cause** is **the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which maps to CWE-20 **Improper Input Validation**.\n\nThe evidence from the vulnerability description is: \"The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated object\".\n\nCWE-125 is more specific and directly reflects the technical weakness, while CWE-20 represents the underlying cause. The hierarchical relationship (CWE-125 ChildOf CWE-20) supports this classification.\n\nOther CWEs considered but not used:\n\n*   CWE-787 **Out-of-bounds Write**: This CWE was not selected because the vulnerability is specifically an **Out-of-bounds Read**, not a write.\n*   CWE-1284 **Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input**: While input validation is a factor, CWE-20 is more general and appropriate as the **Improper Input Validation** doesn't specifically relate to quantities.\n*   CWE-122 **Heap-based Buffer Overflow**: The description mentions an **Out-of-bounds Read**, not necessarily a buffer overflow.\n*   CWE-457 **Use of Uninitialized Variable**: This is not directly related to the described vulnerability.\n*   CWE-126 **Buffer Over-read**: This is very similar to CWE-125, but CWE-125 is preferred.\n```",
