# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2025-29908
## Query
Netty QUIC codec is a QUIC codec for netty which makes use of quiche. An issue was discovered in the codec. A hash collision vulnerability (in the hash map used to manage connections) allows remote attackers to cause a considerable CPU load on the server (a Hash DoS attack) by initiating connections with colliding Source Connection IDs (SCIDs). This vulnerability is fixed in 0.0.71.Final.
