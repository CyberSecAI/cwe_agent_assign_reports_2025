# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-29908

## Vulnerability Description
Netty QUIC codec is a QUIC codec for netty which makes use of quiche. An issue was discovered in the codec. A **hash collision vulnerability** (in the hash map used to manage connections) allows remote attackers to cause a considerable CPU load on the server (a Hash DoS attack) by initiating connections with colliding Source Connection IDs (SCIDs). This vulnerability is fixed in 0.0.71.Final.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **vector:** initiating connections with colliding Source Connection IDs (SCIDs)
- **weakness:** **hash collision vulnerability**
- **product:** Netty QUIC codec
- **impact:** CPU load, DoS attack
- **attacker:** remote attackers

Here's an analysis of the provided content based on your guidelines:

**1. Content from github.com_d782ce82_20250624_210346.html (text)**

*   **Result: UNRELATED**

**2. Content from github.com_7697ed27_20250624_183136.html (stripped)**

*   **Result: RELEVANT**
*   **Extraction:**
    *   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the use of a weak hash function, specifically within the hash map used to manage connections in the QUIC protocol. This allows attackers to cause hash collisions.
    *   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Hash collision vulnerability.
    *   **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can cause a significant CPU load on the server (a Hash DoS attack) by initiating connections with colliding Source Connection IDs (SCIDs), potentially slowing the server by a factor of 300.
    *   **Attack vectors:** Initiating connections with colliding Source Connection IDs (SCIDs).
    *   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Remote attacker. The attacker needs to be able to send QUIC packets. The attacker can freely choose CIDs (connection IDs) and cause collisions under the target hash function used by a vulnerable server.
    *   **Mitigation or fix:** The commit implements a custom hash map that uses SipHash to prevent hash collisions.

**3. Content from github.com_de97bab9_20250624_183138.html (stripped)**

*   **Result: RELEVANT**
*   **Extraction:**
    *   **Root cause of vulnerability:**  A hash collision vulnerability in the hash map used to manage connections.
    *   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Hash collision vulnerability (CWE-407).
    *   **Impact of exploitation:** Remote attackers can cause a considerable CPU load on the server (a Hash DoS attack) by initiating connections with colliding Source Connection IDs (SCIDs).
    *   **Attack vectors:** Initiating connections with colliding Source Connection IDs (SCIDs).
    *   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Network
    *   **Mitigation or fix:** The vulnerability is fixed in version 0.0.71.Final
