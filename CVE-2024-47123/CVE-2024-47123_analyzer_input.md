# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-47123

## Vulnerability Description
The goTenna Pro App uses AES CTR type encryption for short, encrypted messages without any additional integrity checking mechanisms. This leaves messages malleable to an attacker that can access the message. It is recommended to continue to use encryption in the app and update to the current release for more secure operations.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **lack of message integrity checking**
- **impact:** integrity and message malleability
- **attacker:** attacker with access to message
- **product:** goTenna Pro App
