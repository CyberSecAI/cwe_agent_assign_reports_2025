# Summary

| CWE ID  | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| CWE-353 | Missing Support for Integrity Check | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-319 | Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information | 0.4 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis

The primary relationship influencing the decision is the ChildOf relationship between CWE-353 Missing Support for Integrity Check and CWE-345 Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity. While CWE-345 is broader, CWE-353 directly reflects the specific **lack of message integrity checking**. The relationship with peer CWE-354 is also relevant as it indicates other potential integrity-related issues.

## Vulnerability Chain

The vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of message integrity checking** (CWE-353). This leads to the possibility of message manipulation by an attacker, ultimately compromising the integrity of the communication. The chain is: CWE-353 -> Message Manipulation -> Compromised Communication Integrity.

## Summary of Analysis

The initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability described in the goTenna Pro App. The vulnerability description states that the app uses AES CTR encryption without integrity checks, leading to message malleability.

The **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases** section specifically mentions "**rootcause: lack of message integrity checking**". The **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** confirms this by stating: "root_cause: The goTenna Pro App uses AES CTR encryption for short messages without integrity checks" and lists "Missing Support for Integrity Check (CWE-353)" as a weakness.

Based on the evidence, CWE-353 is the most appropriate primary CWE because it directly addresses the **lack of integrity checking**.

CWE-319 was considered as a potential secondary weakness if the messages were transmitted in cleartext. However, it is stated that AES CTR *is* used, so the messages are at least encrypted before transmission, but without an Integrity check.

Therefore, CWE-353 is selected as the primary CWE at the Base level of abstraction, with a confidence score of 1.0. CWE-319 is considered as a secondary candidate with a low confidence score of 0.4

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-941: Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product creates a communication channel to initiate an outgoing request to an actor, but it does not correctly specify the intended destination for that actor.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.67
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-649: Reliance on Obfuscation or Encryption of Security-Relevant Inputs without Integrity Checking
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.66
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses obfuscation or encryption of inputs that should not be mutable by an external actor, but the product does not use integrity checks to detect if those inputs have been modified.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.66
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).

## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.66
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.66
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-451: User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.65
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The user interface (UI) does not properly represent critical information to the user, allowing the information - or its source - to be obscured or spoofed. This is often a component in phishing attacks.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.65
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
To fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non-standard, unproven, or disallowed/non-compliant cryptographic implementation.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
