  "reference_content": "CVE-2025-43955: PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval\n\nThe content is **RELEVANT** and details an Expression Injection Vulnerability in convertigo. Here's the extracted information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nConvertigo uses `TwsCachedXPathAPI` to process XPath queries. The `selectList` and `selectNode` methods within this class execute XPath queries using the commons-jxpath library without essential security configurations. This allows excessively powerful expression parsing and evaluation, including the ability to access and invoke various methods.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Expression Injection\n*   Lack of security configurations in XPath processing.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   Remote Code Execution (RCE)\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Crafting malicious XPath expressions.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   Ability to control the XPath expression used in queries.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\nThe recommended mitigation involves setting an empty function library for the `JXPathContext` to prevent function calls. The provided code snippets demonstrate the fix:\n\n```java\n\tpublic Node selectNode(Node contextNode, String xpath) {\n\t\tNode node;\n\t\ttry {\n+                       JXPathContext context = JXPathContext.newContext(contextNode);\n+                       context.setFunctions(new FunctionLibrary()); // Set empty function library to prevent calling functions\n-\t\t\tnode = (Node) JXPathContext.newContext(contextNode).selectSingleNode(xpath);\n\t\t\tnode = (Node) context.selectSingleNode(xpath);\n\t\t} catch (Exception e) {\n\t\t\tnode = null;\n\t\t}\n\t\treturn node;\n\t}\n```\n\n```java\n@SuppressWarnings(\"unchecked\")\n\tpublic List<Node> selectList(Node contextNode, String xpath) {\n\t\t@SuppressWarnings(\"rawtypes\")\n\t\tList nodes;\n\t\ttry {\n+                       JXPathContext context = JXPathContext.newContext(contextNode);\n+                       context.setFunctions(new FunctionLibrary()); // Set empty function library to prevent calling functions\n-\t\t\tnodes = JXPathContext.newContext(contextNode).selectNodes(xpath);\n\t\t\tnodes = (List) context.selectNodes(xpath);\n\t\t\tint i = 0;\n\t\t\tfor (Object node: nodes) {\n\t\t\t\tif (node instanceof Number) {\n\t\t\t\t\tNumber num = (Number) node;\n\t\t\t\t\tif (num.intValue() == num.doubleValue()) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnode = Integer.toString(num.intValue());\n\t\t\t\t\t} else {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnode = Double.toString(num.doubleValue());\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t} else if (node instanceof Boolean) {\n\t\t\t\t\tnode = node.toString();\n\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t\tif (node instanceof String) {\n\t\t\t\t\tDocument doc =  contextNode instanceof Document ? (Document)contextNode : contextNode.getOwnerDocument();\n\t\t\t\t\tnode = doc.createTextNode((String) node);\n\t\t\t\t\tnodes.set(i, node);\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\ti++;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t} catch (Exception e) {\n\t\t\tnodes = Collections.emptyList();\n\t\t}\n\t\treturn (List<Node>) nodes;\n\t}\n```\n\n**Vulnerable modules:**\n\n*   Connectors\n*   Sequences\n*   XML Mapping Engine\n\nThe content provides more detail than a typical CVE description, including code examples and specific mitigation steps.",
