## Vulnerability Description
In binary-husky/gpt_academic version <= 3.83, the plugin `CodeInterpreter` is vulnerable to code injection caused by prompt injection. The root cause is the execution of user-provided prompts that generate untrusted code without a sandbox, allowing the execution of parts of the LLM-generated code. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to achieve remote code execution (RCE) on the application backend server, potentially gaining full control of the server.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **component:** CodeInterpreter plugin
- **weakness:** **code injection, prompt injection**
- **product:** binary-husky/gpt_academic
- **impact:** ['execute LLM-generated code', 'remote code execution']
- **version:** <= 3.83
