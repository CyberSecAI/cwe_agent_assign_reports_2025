The manipulation of the argument IPv6OpMode/IPv6IPAddr/IPv6WANIPAddr/IPv6GWAddr leads to command injection. It is possible to launch the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",
