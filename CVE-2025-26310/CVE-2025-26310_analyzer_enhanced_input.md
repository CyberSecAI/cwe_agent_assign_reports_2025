## Vulnerability Description
**Multiple memory leaks** have been identified in the ABC file parsing functions (parseABC_CONSTANT_POOL and `parseABC_FILE) in util/parser.c of libming v0.4.8, which allow attackers to cause a denial of service via a crafted ABC file.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **Multiple memory leaks**
- **impact:** denial of service
- **vector:** crafted ABC file
- **attacker:** attackers
- **product:** libming
- **version:** v0.4.8
- **component:** 'parseABC_FILE'] in util/parser.c and ['parseABC_CONSTANT_POOL'

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-26310 (PLACEHOLDER) based on provided content

The provided content details a memory leak vulnerability in libming versions up to and including v0.4.8. While the CVE description is a placeholder, the content clearly relates to a vulnerability affecting the library.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of memory deallocation (using `free()`) after allocating memory for various data structures within the `parseABC_CONSTANT_POOL` and `parseABC_FILE` functions. Specifically, memory is allocated for arrays like `Integers`, `UIntegers`, `Doubles`, `Strings`, `Namespaces`, `NsSets`, `Multinames`, `Methods`, `Metadata`, `Instances`, `Classes`, `Scripts`, and `MethodBodies` using `malloc`, but is never released.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Memory Leak: Failure to free allocated memory leads to a gradual consumption of system resources.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Denial of Service (DoS): Repeated parsing of ABC files can exhaust available memory, leading to application crashes or system instability.
*   Resource Exhaustion:  The leak can degrade system performance over time.

**Attack vectors:**

*   Processing Malicious ABC Files: An attacker can craft a malicious ABC file that, when parsed by a vulnerable version of libming, triggers the memory leak.
*   File Parsing: Any application using libming to parse ABC files is potentially vulnerable.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   Ability to provide an ABC file to the vulnerable application. This could be through file upload, network communication, or other input mechanisms.
*   No special privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Mitigation or fix:**

The content does not explicitly state a fix, but the analysis implies that the vulnerability can be mitigated by adding appropriate `free()` calls to deallocate the memory allocated within the `parseABC_CONSTANT_POOL` and `parseABC_FILE` functions.

**Additional Details:**

The content provides more detail than a typical CVE description, including:

*   Specific function names (`parseABC_CONSTANT_POOL`, `parseABC_FILE`) where the leaks occur.
*   Code snippets illustrating the memory allocation without corresponding deallocation.
*   Output from AddressSanitizer (ASan) confirming the memory leaks and providing details about the allocated memory blocks.
*   A link to a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) exploit.
