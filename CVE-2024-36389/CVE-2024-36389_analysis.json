While it's generally preferred to choose a Base or Variant level CWE, the provided information is not specific enough to determine which child of CWE-330 would be the best fit. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"**use of insufficiently random values**,\" making CWE-330 a direct match. The secondary CWE selected is CWE-306, because **use of insufficiently random values** may allow Authentication Bypass.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe330[\"CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\"]\n    cwe334[\"CWE-334: Small Space of Random Values\"]\n    cwe331[\"CWE-331: Insufficient Entropy\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n\n    cwe334 -->|CHILDOF| cwe330\n    cwe331 -->|CHILDOF| cwe330\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe330 primary\n    class cwe306 secondary\n    class cwe334,cwe331 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **use of insufficiently random values** (CWE-330), which then leads to the impact of authentication bypass.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the vulnerability description and the retriever results. The description clearly states \"**use of insufficiently random values**,\" which aligns perfectly with CWE-330. The retriever results also list CWE-330 as the top candidate. However, CWE-330 is a Class-level CWE, and the guidance suggests preferring Base or Variant levels.
