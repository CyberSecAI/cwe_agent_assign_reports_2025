  "description": "Gladinet CentreStack through 16.1.10296.56315 (fixed in 16.4.10315.56368) has a **deserialization vulnerability** due to the CentreStack portals **hardcoded machineKey use**, as exploited in the wild in March 2025. This enables threat actors (who know the machineKey) to serialize a payload for server-side deserialization to achieve remote code execution. NOTE a CentreStack admin can manually delete the machineKey defined in portal\\\\web.config.",

  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-30406 Content\n\nThe provided content **is relevant** to CVE-2025-30406. It provides significantly more detail than the placeholder CVE description.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe application uses a hardcoded or improperly protected machineKey in the IIS web.config file, responsible for securing ASP.NET ViewState data.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Improper cryptographic key management.\n*   Use of a predictable or easily obtainable machineKey.\n*   Potential for ViewState deserialization attacks.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   Forging of ViewState data.\n*   Unauthorized actions.\n*   Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the web server (in some configurations).\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   An attacker obtaining or predicting the machineKey.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   Ability to obtain or predict the machineKey.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   **Update to patched version (build 16.4.10315.56368):** This version automatically generates a unique machineKey for each installation.\n*   **Rotate the machineKey:** Manually generate a new, unique machineKey in IIS Manager and update the web.config files (both in the root installation folder and the portal folder).  Instructions are provided for single-server and multi-server farm configurations.\n*   **Consult KB article:**  [https://support.centrestack.com/hc/en-us/articles/360007159054-Hardening-the-CentreStack-Cluster#h_01JQRV57T37HJFQZKBZH9NBXQP](https://support.centrestack.com/hc/en-us/articles/360007159054-Hardening-the-CentreStack-Cluster#h_01JQRV57T37HJFQZKBZH9NBXQP) for guidance on generating a unique machineKey and additional configuration considerations.\n\nThe second content snippet (from www.centrestack.com) is largely navigational and does not contain any additional vulnerability information.",

The **hardcoded key** allows attackers to serialize malicious payloads that, when deserialized, lead to remote code execution.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe502[\"CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data\"]\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    cwe798 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe502\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe502 primary\n    class cwe798 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n1.  **Root Cause:** **CWE-798 Use of Hard-coded Credentials**: The application uses a **hardcoded machineKey**.\n2.  **Weakness:** **CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data**: Attackers can exploit this **hardcoded key** to create malicious serialized payloads. The application **deserializes** these payloads without proper validation.\n3.  **Impact:** Remote Code Execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary vulnerability is **CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data**, which is directly caused by the **CWE-798 Use of Hard-coded Credentials**. The evidence provided from the CVE description and the analysis of the CVE reference links clearly indicates that the **hardcoded machineKey** allows attackers to craft malicious serialized payloads, which, when deserialized, leads to remote code execution.\n\nThe selection of **CWE-502** is based on the core issue of **deserializing untrusted data** without proper validation. The **hardcoded machineKey** is the enabler of this vulnerability, making **CWE-798** a contributing factor. Both CWEs are at the Base or Variant level of abstraction, providing sufficient specificity.\n\nThe graph relationships and retriever results support this analysis. **CWE-502** is directly related to the reported remote code execution, and **CWE-798** explains how the attack is made possible. The mitigations also confirm the analysis, as updating the application generates a unique machineKey, addressing the root cause.\n\nThe other CWEs were considered, but ultimately rejected. For example, **CWE-259 Use of Hard-coded Password** and **CWE-321 Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key** are related to **CWE-798**, but **CWE-798** is more general and accurately captures the use of **hardcoded credentials** (not specifically a password or cryptographic key). **CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)** and **CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')** are not relevant to this specific vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
