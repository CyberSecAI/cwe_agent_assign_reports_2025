## Vulnerability Description
Action Pack is a framework for handling and responding to web requests. Since 6.1.0, the application configurable Permissions-Policy is only served on responses with an HTML related Content-Type. This vulnerability is fixed in 6.1.7.8, 7.0.8.2, and 7.1.3.3.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** Permissions-Policy is only served on HTML responses
- **product:** Action Pack
- **version:** since 6.1.0

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The `Permissions-Policy` header, which is configurable in the application, was only being served on responses that had an HTML related `Content-Type`. This meant that non-HTML content types, such as `application/json` or `image/svg+xml`, were not receiving the policy.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Missing Security Header:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of the `Permissions-Policy` header on non-HTML responses, which could result in inconsistent or weakened security enforcement for those content types.
- **Inconsistent Policy Application:** The application's security policy was not being consistently applied across all relevant content types.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The impact is that the configured Permissions-Policy is not enforced for non-HTML content types which could lead to unexpected behavior or a compromise of security for non-HTML content.
- The NetApp advisory indicates that successful exploitation could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service. This suggests that depending on the application's use of non-HTML content and the policy it's trying to enforce, the lack of a `Permissions-Policy` header could have severe consequences.

**Attack Vectors:**
- This vulnerability is not directly exploited via a network request but rather by a lack of security policy enforcement when serving non-HTML content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker doesn't need any special capabilities or position to exploit this vulnerability. The vulnerability occurs when the server fails to send the `Permissions-Policy` header for non-HTML responses.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects Rails versions 6.1.0 and above.
*   Patches are available for the 6.1, 7.0, and 7.1 series of Rails.
*   The fix includes modifying the `PermissionsPolicy` middleware to apply the `Permissions-Policy` header regardless of content type.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set ‚Äì Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* üîç *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* üîç *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion ‚Äì CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### üî∏ CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ‚úÖ *‚ÄúA user created with the ‚Äòguest‚Äô role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.‚Äù*

#### üî∏ CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ‚úÖ *‚ÄúThe backup service runs as root but only needs read access.‚Äù*

#### üî∏ CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### üî∏ CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ‚úÖ *‚ÄúUser can access another user‚Äôs invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.‚Äù*

## Mapping Examples ‚Äì Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *‚ÄúUser can escalate privileges to admin.‚Äù*
> ‚ùå Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged ‚Äì only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ‚úÖ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**
