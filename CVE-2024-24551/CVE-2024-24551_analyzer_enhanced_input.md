## Vulnerability Description
A security vulnerability has been identified in Bludit, allowing authenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code through the Image API. This vulnerability arises from **improper handling of file uploads**, enabling malicious actors to upload and execute PHP files.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **improper handling of file uploads**
- **impact:** execute PHP files and execute arbitrary code
- **attacker:** authenticated attackers
- **product:** Bludit
- **component:** Image API

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-24551:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the Bludit Image API's improper handling of file uploads. While the API performs some checks on file extensions, it stores uploaded files in a temporary directory within the web root. If the uploaded file's extension is not allowed, the file is not deleted from this temporary directory. This allows an attacker to upload a PHP file, which can then be accessed and executed via the web.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Inadequate file extension validation:** The API checks for allowed image extensions but does not delete the file if the extension is not in the allowlist.
-   **Insecure temporary file storage:** Files are stored in a temporary directory within the web root which is accessible to unauthenticated users.
-   **Lack of file cleanup:** Files uploaded with disallowed extensions are not removed from the temporary directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation allows an attacker to achieve **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**. By uploading a malicious PHP file (e.g., a web shell) to the temporary directory, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server. This can lead to complete compromise of the system, including data exfiltration, malware deployment, and further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Image API:** The vulnerability is triggered through the Image API's file upload functionality.
-   **File Upload:** An attacker uploads a malicious file with a non-allowed extension.
-   **Web Access:**  The attacker then accesses the uploaded file via the web root, triggering the malicious code's execution.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to the Bludit application and have access to the API.
-  **API Token:** The attacker needs to know the API token
-   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the Bludit server and retrieve the response.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the /api/images endpoint
