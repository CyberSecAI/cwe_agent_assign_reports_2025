## Analysis of CVE-2025-5098 - Mobile Dynamix PrinterShare Mobile Print Gmail Oauth Token Disclosure

This content is **RELEVANT** to CVE-2025-5098. It provides a detailed advisory regarding a Gmail OAuth token disclosure vulnerability in the PrinterShare Mobile Print application. Here's an extraction of the relevant information:

**1. Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the insecure storage and reuse of Gmail authentication tokens within the PrinterShare application. Specifically, the OAuth token is stored in plaintext and is reintroduced in multiple activities (ActivityGmail.java and ActivityGmailConversation.java), allowing an attacker to capture and reuse it.

**2. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor:** The Gmail OAuth token, a sensitive credential, is exposed.
*   **CWE-313: Cleartext Storage in a File or on Disk:** The token is stored in plaintext within the application's memory.
*   **Insecure Activity Interaction:** The target Activity is exported as true, allowing any application with appropriate permissions to interact with it.

**3. Impact of exploitation:**

Successful exploitation allows an attacker to capture the user's Gmail authentication token and use it to access their Gmail account without proper authorization, compromising the confidentiality of the inbox.

**4. Attack vectors:**

*   An attacker can attach the device email to the application by opening the application and clicking 'Gmail', then choosing the account.
*   Using tools like Frida to hook into the application's code and intercept the token during authentication.
*   Exploiting the exported Activity to interact with the application and capture the token.

**5. Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs access to the target Android device.
*   Root access to the device is mentioned in the technical description (Android 13 aarch64 - Samsung Rooted), but it's not explicitly stated as a requirement for the exploit itself. Frida server requires root access.
*   Knowledge of Frida and Android application debugging is required to utilize the provided proof-of-concept exploit script.
*   Ability to install and run Frida client on a separate machine (Ubuntu 24.04 LTS in the example).

**6. Mitigation or fix:**

*   As of the publication date (2025-05-22), no response from the vendor was received, and no known mitigations are available to end-users.

**Additional Details (more detail than the official CVE description):**

*   **Affected Versions:** Up to version 12.15.01
*   **Platform:** Android
*   **Specific Code Locations:** The vulnerability is present in `ActivityGmail.java` and `ActivityGmailConversation.java`. Specific code snippets demonstrating the token leakage are provided.
*   **Proof of Concept:** A Frida script (`exploit.js`) is included, demonstrating how to capture the token and access Gmail inbox data.
*   **Disclosure Timeline:** Details of the vulnerability disclosure process are provided, including dates of contact attempts and public disclosure.
*   **Technical Setup:** The advisory details the specific environment used for testing (Android 13, Samsung Galaxy Tab A7 Lite, Frida client on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS).

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control

**Authentication**:
Determines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.

* Example phrases: "user must log in", "lack of login check", "bypasses login"
* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.

  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* – used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).

**Authorization**:
Determines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do. It decides access *after* identity is verified.

* Example phrases: "unauthorized access", "regular user can access admin panel", "role checks are missing"
* CWE relevance: use CWEs like 862, 863, 285 for authorization errors:

  * **CWE-862**: *Missing Authorization* – the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all.
  * **CWE-863**: *Incorrect Authorization* – the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).
  * **CWE-285**: *Improper Authorization* – general category for any flawed authorization logic or design.

**Access Control**:
A broader term that includes both authentication and authorization. Governs how resources are protected and who can access them under what conditions.

* CWE relevance:

  * **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* – top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear.
  * This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.

## Mapping Discussion – Common Misclassification Patterns

### 1. **CWE-306 vs CWE-862**:

* **306** is about lack of **authentication** (e.g., *no login required at all*).
* **862** is about lack of **authorization** *after* authentication (e.g., *admin check missing*).
* ✅ Example CWE-306: *“An unauthenticated attacker can invoke the password reset API.”*
* ✅ Example CWE-862: *“An authenticated user without admin privileges can delete any user account.”*

### 2. **CWE-285 vs CWE-284**:

* **285** is specific to authorization flaws – it's a better choice than 284 **if** the issue involves *improper or missing role checks*.
* **284** should be reserved for general access control issues when it’s unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.

---

## Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification

**Phrase like "unauthorized access" is not enough.**

* If you **cannot determine whether identity was checked**, assume it’s **authorization** and consider 862 or 863.
* If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** → CWE-306.
* If the **access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced**, but it's not due to missing checks, consider **CWE-284**.

---

## Good Mapping Examples

* ✅ **CWE-306**: “The endpoint `/admin/deleteUser` does not require any authentication.”
* ✅ **CWE-862**: “Any logged-in user can change any other user's email without being an admin.”
* ✅ **CWE-863**: “An admin check exists but incorrectly grants access to non-admin users.”
* ✅ **CWE-285**: “Application uses a static role check that fails when roles change dynamically.”
* ✅ **CWE-284**: “Inconsistent enforcement of access rules across services with unclear policy source.”

| Role check is present but flawed                           | CWE-863        |
| General or ambiguous authorization failure                 | CWE-285        |
