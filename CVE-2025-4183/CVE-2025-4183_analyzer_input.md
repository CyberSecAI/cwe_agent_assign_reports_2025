## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-4183 Content

This content **RELATES** to a vulnerability in PCMan FTP Server, specifically a remote buffer overflow. It provides a detailed exploit script and analysis, going beyond the information typically found in a CVE description.

Here's a breakdown of the extracted information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   A buffer overflow exists in the `RECV` command handling of PCMan FTP Server version 2.0.7.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Remote Buffer Overflow: The server does not properly validate the size of input received via the `RECV` command, allowing an attacker to overwrite memory regions.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   The exploit aims to gain remote code execution on the target system. The provided script uses `msfvenom` to generate a shellcode payload.

**Attack vectors:**

*   Remote: The vulnerability is exploitable remotely via the FTP protocol.
*   Specifically, sending a crafted payload to the `RECV` command.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   Network access to the target PCMan FTP Server.
*   Ability to send FTP commands.
*   Knowledge of the buffer overflow offset (2006 bytes) and the address of a `JMP ESP` instruction (0x74e32fd9).
*   Ability to craft a suitable payload (using tools like `msfvenom`).

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   The content does not explicitly mention a fix. However, the vulnerability can be mitigated by:
    *   Updating to a patched version of PCMan FTP Server.
    *   Implementing proper input validation and bounds checking in the `RECV` command handler.
    *   Disabling the `RECV` command if it is not necessary.

**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**

*   **Version Affected:** PCMan FTP Server 2.0.7
*   **Tested On:** Windows XP SP3 (Build 2600)
*   **Exploit Script:** A Perl script is provided that demonstrates the exploitation process.
*   **Offset:** 2006 bytes
*   **EIP overwrite:** 0x74e32fd9 (JMP ESP)
*   **Bad Characters:** \x00\x0a\x0d
*   **Payload Generation:** The script uses `msfvenom` to generate a Windows shellcode payload.
*   **Connection Details:** The script attempts to connect to the target on port 21.
*   **FTP commands used:** USER, PASS, RECV
*   **NOP sled:** 20 NOP instructions (\x90) are used before the shellcode.
