  "query": "A vulnerability was found in rizinorg rizin up to 0.7.4. It has been rated as critical. This issue affects the function msf_stream_directory_free in the library /librz/bin/pdb/pdb.c. The manipulation of the argument -P leads to buffer overflow. Local access is required to approach this attack. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. Upgrading to version 0.8.0 is able to address this issue. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component.",
