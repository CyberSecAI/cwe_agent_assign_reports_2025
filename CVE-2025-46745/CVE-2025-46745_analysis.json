The application **does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization** when an authenticated user without user-management permissions could view other users account information. |\n| CWE-668 | Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere | 0.7 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary CWE. The application exposes account information to an authenticated user without the appropriate permissions. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship influencing the CWE selection is that CWE-862 [Missing Authorization] is a child of CWE-284 [Improper Access Control], offering a more specific classification than its parent. Additionally, CWE-668 [Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere] is a peer that captures the broad impact of the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe668 -->|PEEROF| cwe862\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe668 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **missing authorization** checks (CWE-862), which leads to the **exposure of sensitive information** to an unauthorized user (CWE-668).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment and final conclusion are primarily based on the vulnerability description which states, \"An authenticated user without user-management permissions could view other users account information.\" This indicates a clear **lack of proper authorization** mechanisms, aligning well with CWE-862.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the final selection by highlighting the parent-child relationship between CWE-862 and CWE-284, reinforcing the choice of the more specific CWE-862.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-862 directly addresses the **missing authorization**, while CWE-668 captures the resulting **exposure of sensitive data**.
