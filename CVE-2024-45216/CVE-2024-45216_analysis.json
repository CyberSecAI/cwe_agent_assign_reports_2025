  "description": "**Improper Authentication vulnerability** in Apache Solr. Solr instances using the PKIAuthenticationPlugin, which is enabled by default when Solr Authentication is used, are vulnerable to Authentication bypass. A fake ending at the end of any Solr API URL path, will allow requests to skip Authentication while maintaining the API contract with the original URL Path. This fake ending looks like an unprotected API path, however it is stripped off internally after authentication but before API routing. This issue affects Apache Solr from 5.3.0 before 8.11.4, from 9.0.0 before 9.7.0. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 9.7.0, or 8.11.4, which fix the issue.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-45216:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\n*   Improper authentication in Apache Solr when using the `PKIAuthenticationPlugin`.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Authentication Bypass:** The vulnerability allows requests to bypass authentication by appending a \"fake ending\" to a Solr API URL path. This fake ending is designed to look like an unprotected API path.\n*   **Path Stripping:** The \"fake ending\" is stripped off internally *after* the authentication check, but *before* API routing. This allows the request to reach the intended API endpoint without proper authentication.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   An attacker can access Solr API endpoints without proper authentication, potentially gaining unauthorized access to sensitive data and operations, by appending fake path endings.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   The attack vector is through crafted HTTP requests to any Solr API URL by adding a fake path ending.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   The attacker needs network access to a vulnerable Solr instance.\n*   No specific user privileges are required since the vulnerability bypasses authentication itself.\n*   The attacker needs knowledge of how to construct a URL with a fake path ending to exploit the vulnerability\n\n**Affected Versions:**\n\n*   Apache Solr 5.3.0 before 8.11.4\n*   Apache Solr 9.0.0 before 9.7.0\n\n**Mitigation:**\n\n*   Upgrade to Apache Solr version 8.11.4 or 9.7.0.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n*   The `PKIAuthenticationPlugin` is enabled by default when Solr authentication is used.\n*   This is considered a **critical** severity vulnerability\n*   The vulnerability is tracked as SOLR-17417 in the Apache Jira.",

CWE-289 and CWE-863 are secondary candidates. CWE-289 is related to bypassing authentication using alternate names, which aligns with the \"fake ending\" aspect of the vulnerability. CWE-863 represents a broader class of authorization issues. The relationship analysis supports selecting CWE-306 as the primary cause due to the **missing authentication** issue, with CWE-289 and CWE-863 potentially providing additional context.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe289[\"CWE-289: Authentication Bypass by Alternate Name\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n\n    cwe289 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1390\n    cwe863 -->|PEEROF| cwe289\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe306 primary\n    class cwe289,cwe863 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authentication** check for certain API paths due to the \"fake ending\" trick. This leads to authentication bypass, allowing unauthorized access to Solr API endpoints.\n  - Root Cause: **CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function**\n  - Mechanism: Fake URL endings leading to bypassed authentication.\n  - Impact: Unauthorized access to Solr API endpoints.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis strongly points to **CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function** as the primary CWE. The \"fake ending\" allows requests to bypass authentication, directly matching the CWE description. The evidence includes the vulnerability description stating \"**Improper Authentication vulnerability**\" and the CVE reference summary highlighting that requests can \"skip Authentication.\" The guidance on authentication vs. authorization clearly indicates that when no identity validation is performed, CWE-306 is the appropriate choice.\n\nCWE-289 Authentication Bypass by Alternate Name was considered because the vulnerability uses a \"fake ending\" in the URL to bypass authentication. This aligns with the concept of using an alternate name to circumvent authentication. However, CWE-306 is a more direct representation of the root cause which is **missing authentication**.\n\nCWE-863 Incorrect Authorization was also considered, but the primary issue is the lack of authentication, not an incorrect authorization check after authentication.\n\nTherefore, **CWE-306** is selected as the primary CWE due to the **missing authentication** check, while CWE-289 and CWE-863 are secondary candidates that provide additional context. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-306 being a base-level CWE directly addressing the root cause.",
