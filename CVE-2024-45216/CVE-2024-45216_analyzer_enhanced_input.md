## Vulnerability Description
**Improper Authentication vulnerability** in Apache Solr. Solr instances using the PKIAuthenticationPlugin, which is enabled by default when Solr Authentication is used, are vulnerable to Authentication bypass. A fake ending at the end of any Solr API URL path, will allow requests to skip Authentication while maintaining the API contract with the original URL Path. This fake ending looks like an unprotected API path, however it is stripped off internally after authentication but before API routing. This issue affects Apache Solr from 5.3.0 before 8.11.4, from 9.0.0 before 9.7.0. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 9.7.0, or 8.11.4, which fix the issue.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **Improper Authentication vulnerability**
- **impact:** authentication bypass
- **vector:** fake ending at the end of any Solr API URL path
- **product:** Apache Solr
- **version:** 5.3.0 to 8.11.4 and 9.0.0 to 9.7.0

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-45216:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Improper authentication in Apache Solr when using the `PKIAuthenticationPlugin`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** The vulnerability allows requests to bypass authentication by appending a "fake ending" to a Solr API URL path. This fake ending is designed to look like an unprotected API path.
*   **Path Stripping:** The "fake ending" is stripped off internally *after* the authentication check, but *before* API routing. This allows the request to reach the intended API endpoint without proper authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can access Solr API endpoints without proper authentication, potentially gaining unauthorized access to sensitive data and operations, by appending fake path endings.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through crafted HTTP requests to any Solr API URL by adding a fake path ending.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs network access to a vulnerable Solr instance.
*   No specific user privileges are required since the vulnerability bypasses authentication itself.
*   The attacker needs knowledge of how to construct a URL with a fake path ending to exploit the vulnerability

**Affected Versions:**

*   Apache Solr 5.3.0 before 8.11.4
*   Apache Solr 9.0.0 before 9.7.0

**Mitigation:**

*   Upgrade to Apache Solr version 8.11.4 or 9.7.0.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The `PKIAuthenticationPlugin` is enabled by default when Solr authentication is used.
*   This is considered a **critical** severity vulnerability
*   The vulnerability is tracked as SOLR-17417 in the Apache Jira.

- **CVE-2004-0847:** Bypass of authentication for files using "\" (backslash) or "%5C" (encoded backslash).




## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or "zeroize" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.

### Extended Description


When resources are released, they can be made available for reuse. For example, after memory is de-allocated, an operating system may make the memory available to another process, or disk space may be reallocated when a file is deleted. As removing information requires time and additional resources, operating systems do not usually clear the previously written information.


Even when the resource is reused by the same process, this weakness can arise when new data is not as large as the old data, which leaves portions of the old data still available. Equivalent errors can occur in other situations where the length of data is variable but the associated data structure is not. If memory is not cleared after use, the information may be read by less trustworthy parties when the memory is reallocated.


This weakness can apply in hardware, such as when a device or system switches between power, sleep, or debug states during normal operation, or when execution changes to different users or privilege levels.


### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-459
ChildOf -> CWE-212
CanPrecede -> CWE-201

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** There is a close association between CWE-226 and CWE-212. The difference is partially that of perspective. CWE-226 is geared towards the final stage of the resource lifecycle, in which the resource is deleted, eliminated, expired, or otherwise released for reuse. Technically, this involves a transfer to a different control sphere, in which the original contents of the resource are no longer relevant. CWE-212, however, is intended for sensitive data in resources that are intentionally shared with others, so they are still active. This distinction is useful from the perspective of the CWE research view (CWE-1000).

**[Maintenance]** This entry needs modification to clarify the differences with CWE-212. The description also combines two problems that are distinct from the CWE research perspective: the inadvertent transfer of information to another sphere, and improper initialization/shutdown. Some of the associated taxonomy mappings reflect these different uses.

**[Research Gap]** This is frequently found for network packets, but it can also exist in local memory allocation, files, etc.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2019-3733:** Cryptography library does not clear heap memory before release
- **CVE-2003-0001:** Ethernet NIC drivers do not pad frames with null bytes, leading to infoleak from malformed packets.
- **CVE-2003-0291:** router does not clear information from DHCP packets that have been previously used




## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.

### Extended Description


Attackers may be able to bypass weak authentication faster and/or with less effort than expected.


### Alternative Terms
None

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-30034:** Chain: Web UI for a Python RPC framework does not use regex anchors to validate user login emails (CWE-777), potentially allowing bypass of OAuth (CWE-1390).
- **CVE-2022-35248:** Chat application skips validation when Central Authentication Service (CAS) is enabled, effectively removing the second factor from two-factor authentication
- **CVE-2021-3116:** Chain: Python-based HTTP Proxy server uses the wrong boolean operators (CWE-480) causing an incorrect comparison (CWE-697) that identifies an authN failure if all three conditions are met instead of only one, allowing bypass of the proxy authentication (CWE-1390)




## CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The web server receives a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
XSPA: Cross Site Port Attack
SSRF: Server-Side Request Forgery

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-441
ChildOf -> CWE-610

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** CWE-918 (SSRF) and CWE-611 (XXE) are closely related, because they both involve web-related technologies and can launch outbound requests to unexpected destinations. However, XXE can be performed client-side, or in other contexts in which the software is not acting directly as a server, so the "Server" portion of the SSRF acronym does not necessarily apply.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2023-32786:** Chain: LLM integration framework has prompt injection (CWE-1427) that allows an attacker to force the service to retrieve data from an arbitrary URL, essentially providing SSRF (CWE-918) and potentially injecting content into downstream tasks.
- **CVE-2021-26855:** Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in mail server, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2021-21973:** Server Side Request Forgery in cloud platform, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.




## CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the product does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.

### Extended Description


Many file operations are intended to take place within a restricted directory. By using special elements such as ".." and "/" separators, attackers can escape outside of the restricted location to access files or directories that are elsewhere on the system. One of the most common special elements is the "../" sequence, which in most modern operating systems is interpreted as the parent directory of the current location. This is referred to as relative path traversal. Path traversal also covers the use of absolute pathnames such as "/usr/local/bin" to access unexpected files. This is referred to as absolute path traversal.


### Alternative Terms
Directory traversal
Path traversal: "Path traversal" is preferred over "directory traversal," but both terms are attack-focused.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-706
ChildOf -> CWE-706
ChildOf -> CWE-668

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Other]** In many programming languages, the injection of a null byte (the 0 or NUL) may allow an attacker to truncate a generated filename to apply to a wider range of files. For example, the product may add ".txt" to any pathname, thus limiting the attacker to text files, but a null injection may effectively remove this restriction.

**[Relationship]** Pathname equivalence can be regarded as a type of canonicalization error.

**[Relationship]** Some pathname equivalence issues are not directly related to directory traversal, rather are used to bypass security-relevant checks for whether a file/directory can be accessed by the attacker (e.g. a trailing "/" on a filename could bypass access rules that don't expect a trailing /, causing a server to provide the file when it normally would not).

**[Terminology]** 

Like other weaknesses, terminology is often based on the types of manipulations used, instead of the underlying weaknesses. Some people use "directory traversal" only to refer to the injection of ".." and equivalent sequences whose specific meaning is to traverse directories.


Other variants like "absolute pathname" and "drive letter" have the *effect* of directory traversal, but some people may not call it such, since it doesn't involve ".." or equivalent.


**[Research Gap]** Many variants of path traversal attacks are probably under-studied with respect to root cause. CWE-790 and CWE-182 begin to cover part of this gap.

**[Research Gap]** 

Incomplete diagnosis or reporting of vulnerabilities can make it difficult to know which variant is affected. For example, a researcher might say that "..\" is vulnerable, but not test "../" which may also be vulnerable.


Any combination of directory separators ("/", "\", etc.) and numbers of "." (e.g. "....") can produce unique variants; for example, the "//../" variant is not listed (CVE-2004-0325). See this entry's children and lower-level descendants.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2024-37032:** Large language model (LLM) management tool does not validate the format of a digest value (CWE-1287) from a private, untrusted model registry, enabling relative path traversal (CWE-23), a.k.a. Probllama
- **CVE-2024-4315:** Chain: API for text generation using Large Language Models (LLMs) does not include the "\" Windows folder separator in its denylist (CWE-184) when attempting to prevent Local File Inclusion via path traversal (CWE-22), allowing deletion of arbitrary files on Windows systems.
- **CVE-2022-45918:** Chain: a learning management tool debugger uses external input to locate previous session logs (CWE-73) and does not properly validate the given path (CWE-20), allowing for filesystem path traversal using "../" sequences (CWE-24)
