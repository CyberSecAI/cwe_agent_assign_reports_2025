Since the vulnerability description indicates a problem with **access permission verification**, I considered these child CWEs more specific and relevant than the generic CWE-284. I chose CWE-862 as the primary CWE because the description focuses on a **missing access permission verification**, suggesting the authorization mechanism might be entirely absent rather than just incorrectly implemented.

The description highlights a **missing** or **improper** check leading to potential service confidentiality impact. Given the evidence, I selected CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) as the primary CWE. The retriever results listed several authorization-related CWEs like CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) and CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization), which were considered but deemed less accurate because the root cause is a **missing** verification, not an incorrect one. The complete CWE specifications and the relationship analysis with parent CWEs like CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) further supported this decision. The provided guidance on privileges vs. permissions helped narrow down the options, focusing on authorization-related issues.
