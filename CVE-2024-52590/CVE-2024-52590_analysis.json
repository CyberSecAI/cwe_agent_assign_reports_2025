  "description": "Misskey is an open source, federated social media platform. In affected versions **missing validation in `ApRequestService.signedGet`** allows an attacker to create fake user profiles that appear to be from a different instance than the one where they actually exist. These profiles can be used to impersonate existing users from the target instance. Vulnerable Misskey instances will accept spoofed users as valid, allowing an attacker to impersonate users on another instance. Attackers have full control of the spoofed user and can post, renote, or otherwise interact like a real account. This issue has been addressed in version 2024.11.0-alpha.3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",

While CWE-285 is a high-level class, the information provided doesn't give enough information to go to a more specific child. CWE-290 and CWE-639 were also considered, but deemed secondary because they are more specific types of authorization bypasses.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe290[\"CWE-290: Authentication Bypass by Spoofing\"]\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n\n    cwe290 -->|PEEROF| cwe639\n    cwe290 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe639 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe285 primary\n    class cwe290,cwe639 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing validation** in `ApRequestService.signedGet`, leading to **improper authorization**. This allows an attacker to create fake user profiles, impersonate users, and interact as a real account.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on the **missing validation** aspect as the root cause. The primary CWE selected is CWE-285 (**Improper Authorization**), because there is **missing validation** in `ApRequestService.signedGet`. From the vulnerability description: \"In affected versions **missing validation in `ApRequestService.signedGet`** allows an attacker to create fake user profiles that appear to be from a different instance than the one where they actually exist. These profiles can be used to impersonate existing users from the target instance.\"\n\nCWE-290 (**Authentication Bypass by Spoofing**) was considered because the attacker is creating fake profiles and impersonating users, which is a form of spoofing. However, the root cause is the **missing validation**, not necessarily a flaw in the authentication scheme itself.\n\nCWE-639 (**Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key**) was considered because the attacker is essentially modifying user profiles to gain access. However, this is a consequence of the **missing validation**, not the primary weakness.\n\nCWE-285 is a Class-level CWE, and the guidance discourages its use if more specific CWEs are available. However, based on the available evidence, a more specific CWE cannot be selected.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-294: Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA capture-replay flaw exists when the design of the product makes it possible for a malicious user to sniff network traffic and bypass authentication by replaying it to the server in question to the same effect as the original message (or with minor changes).\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-290: Authentication Bypass by Spoofing\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThis attack-focused weakness is caused by incorrectly implemented authentication schemes that are subject to spoofing attacks.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product requires authentication, but the product has an alternate path or channel that does not require authentication.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-941: Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product creates a communication channel to initiate an outgoing request to an actor, but it does not correctly specify the intended destination for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-451: User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe user interface (UI) does not properly represent critical information to the user, allowing the information - or its source - to be obscured or spoofed.
