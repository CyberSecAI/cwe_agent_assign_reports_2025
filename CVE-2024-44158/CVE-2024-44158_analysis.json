CWE-497, Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere, could be considered as the impact, where sensitive information is exposed because it wasn't properly removed.\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe212[\"CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\"]\n    cwe497[\"CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\"]\n    \n    cwe497 -->|RESULTED_FROM| cwe212\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe212 primary\n    class cwe497 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is as follows:\n1.  The application fails to properly remove or redact sensitive information. (**ROOT CAUSE**: CWE-212)\n2.  This results in the exposure of sensitive system information to an unauthorized control sphere. (Impact: CWE-497)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is the **improper removal of sensitive information**, which directly leads to the exposure of user data. This is supported by the description stating the vulnerability was addressed with \"improved redaction of sensitive information\". The retriever results and the vulnerability description both support selecting CWE-212 as the primary CWE. CWE-497 describes the impact of this **improper removal**.
