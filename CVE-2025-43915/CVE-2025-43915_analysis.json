Verification:**\n\nThe content directly addresses CVE-2025-43915, detailing a resource exhaustion vulnerability in Linkerd proxies.\n\n**2. Extracted Information:**\n\n*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Linkerd proxies track metrics for inbound and outbound HTTP requests, including `authority` and `hostname` labels. A large number of unique hostnames in these labels can lead to high cardinality of metrics data, consuming excessive proxy memory.\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Resource exhaustion due to unbounded metric cardinality. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in the tracking of `authority` and `hostname` labels in Prometheus metrics.\n*   **Impact of exploitation:**  Proxy memory consumption, overwhelmed metrics ingestion infrastructure, and increased costs for third-party metrics ingestors.\n*   **Attack vectors:**  Malicious URLs crafted to increase the number of unique hostnames processed by the Linkerd proxy. This is particularly relevant for proxies exposed to the internet or handling traffic from untrusted sources.\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Linkerd proxy with a large and varying number of hostnames. No specific privileges are required.\n*   **Mitigation or fix:**\n    *   Prevent Linkerd proxies from being exposed to HTTP requests with an unbounded number of unique hostnames (e.g., filtering requests before they reach the proxy).\n    *   Update to:\n        *   edge-25.2.1 or later\n        *   Buoyant Enterprise for Linkerd releases 2.16.5, 2.17.2, 2.18.0, or later.\n*   **CWE:** CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\n*   **CVSS v3.1 Vector:** AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:L/E:P/RL:O/RC:C\n*   **CVSS Temporal Score:** 5.2\n\n**3. Additional Notes:**\n\n*   The documentation provides more detail than the CVE description alone, specifically outlining the affected labels (`authority` and `hostname`) and the versions impacted.\n*   The content clearly identifies which Linkerd releases are vulnerable and provides specific upgrade recommendations.\n*   The documentation also explains *why* this is a problem (high cardinality metrics) and *how* it can be exploited (malicious URLs).\n*   The website content also provides links to related resources like whitepapers and webinars.",
