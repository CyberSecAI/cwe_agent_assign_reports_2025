  "description": "A vulnerability was found in PHPGurukul Vehicle Parking Management System 1.13. It has been classified as critical. This affects an unknown part of the file /admin/view-incomingvehicle-detail.php. The manipulation of the argument viewid leads to **sql injection**. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.",

No login or authorization is required to exploit this vulnerability.\n*   **Payloads:** The content provides several example payloads, including boolean-based blind, time-based blind, and UNION query payloads.\n*   **Mitigation or fix:** The suggested repair is to employ prepared statements and parameter binding, conduct input validation and filtering, and minimize database user permissions.\n\n**More Detail than CVE Description:**\nThis content provides a detailed explanation of the vulnerability, including the vulnerable file, parameter, and payloads. It also includes an example request packet and screenshots of a tool (sqlmap) being used to exploit the vulnerability. The CVE description is a placeholder, so this content provides much more detail.\n```",

There were no child or parent relationships that significantly altered the selection, as CWE-89 at the Base level is the most specific and appropriate classification.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe89 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain consists of a single step: **improper neutralization** leading directly to **SQL injection**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified **SQL Injection** as the primary **weakness**, which directly corresponds to CWE-89. The evidence from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary clearly states that the **/admin/view-incomingvehicle-detail.php** file has an **SQL injection** vulnerability due to insufficient validation of the \"viewid\" parameter. This aligns perfectly with the CWE-89 description, which involves constructing an SQL command using externally-influenced input without proper neutralization. The suggested mitigation of employing prepared statements and parameter binding further validates this classification.\n\nThe retriever results also strongly support this mapping, with CWE-89 having the highest score. The mapping guidance for CWE-89 indicates that its usage is \"Allowed\" and it is at the Base level of abstraction, making it an appropriate choice.\n\nOther CWEs were considered but ultimately deemed less relevant. For example, CWE-79 (Cross-site Scripting) was considered, but the vulnerability specifically involves **SQL injection**, not the improper neutralization of input for web page generation. Similarly, CWE-434 (Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type) and CWE-1336 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine) were not applicable because the vulnerability does not involve file uploads or template engine usage.\n\nThe final decision is based on the direct evidence of **SQL injection** in the vulnerability description and CVE reference, as well as the strong support from the retriever results and mapping guidance for CWE-89.",
