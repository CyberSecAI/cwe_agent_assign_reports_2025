## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component. Without sufficient removal or quoting of SQL syntax in user-controllable inputs, the generated SQL query can cause those inputs to be interpreted as SQL instead of ordinary user data.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
SQL injection: a common attack-oriented phrase
SQLi: a common abbreviation for "SQL injection"

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-943
ChildOf -> CWE-74

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**

### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** SQL injection can be resultant from special character mismanagement, MAID, or denylist/allowlist problems. It can be primary to authentication errors.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2023-32530:** SQL injection in security product dashboard using crafted certificate fields
- **CVE-2021-42258:** SQL injection in time and billing software, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2021-27101:** SQL injection in file-transfer system via a crafted Host header, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.




## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

### Extended Description


Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:


  1. Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.

  1. The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.

  1. During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.

  1. A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.

  1. Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.

  1. This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.

There are three main kinds of XSS:

  -  **Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent)**  - The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.

  -  **Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent)**  - The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs. 

  -  **Type 0: DOM-Based XSS**  - In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible. 

Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as "drive-by hacking."

In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.


### Alternative Terms
XSS: A common abbreviation for Cross-Site Scripting.
HTML Injection: Used as a synonym of stored (Type 2) XSS.
CSS: In the early years after initial discovery of XSS, "CSS" was a commonly-used acronym. However, this would cause confusion with "Cascading Style Sheets," so usage of this acronym has declined significantly.

**Reasons:**

### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** 

There can be a close relationship between XSS and CSRF (CWE-352). An attacker might use CSRF in order to trick the victim into submitting requests to the server in which the requests contain an XSS payload. A well-known example of this was the Samy worm on MySpace [REF-956]. The worm used XSS to insert malicious HTML sequences into a user's profile and add the attacker as a MySpace friend. MySpace friends of that victim would then execute the payload to modify their own profiles, causing the worm to propagate exponentially. Since the victims did not intentionally insert the malicious script themselves, CSRF was a root cause.


**[Applicable Platform]** 

XSS flaws are very common in web applications, since they require a great deal of developer discipline to avoid them.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-25926:** Python Library Manager did not sufficiently neutralize a user-supplied search term, allowing reflected XSS.
- **CVE-2021-25963:** Python-based e-commerce platform did not escape returned content on error pages, allowing for reflected Cross-Site Scripting attacks.
- **CVE-2021-1879:** Universal XSS in mobile operating system, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.




## CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function
**Abstraction:** Base

## CWE-287: Improper Authentication
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
When an actor claims to have a given identity, the product does not prove or insufficiently proves that the claim is correct.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
authentification: An alternate term is "authentification", which appears to be most commonly used by people from non-English-speaking countries.
AuthN: "AuthN" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authentication" within the web application security community. It is also distinct from "AuthZ," which is an abbreviation of "authorization." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.
AuthC: "AuthC" is used as an abbreviation of "authentication," but it appears to used less frequently than "AuthN."

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-284

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** This CWE entry might be misused when lower-level CWE entries are likely to be applicable. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
**Comments:** Consider children or descendants, beginning with CWE-1390: Weak Authentication or CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse
**Suggested Alternatives:**
- CWE-1390: Weak Authentication
- CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This can be resultant from SQL injection vulnerabilities and other issues.

**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-35248:** Chat application skips validation when Central Authentication Service (CAS) is enabled, effectively removing the second factor from two-factor authentication
- **CVE-2022-36436:** Python-based authentication proxy does not enforce password authentication during the initial handshake, allowing the client to bypass authentication by specifying a 'None' authentication type.
- **CVE-2022-30034:** Chain: Web UI for a Python RPC framework does not use regex anchors to validate user login emails (CWE-777), potentially allowing bypass of OAuth (CWE-1390).




## CWE-285: Improper Authorization
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.

### Extended Description


Assuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.


When access control checks are not applied consistently - or not at all - users are able to access data or perform actions that they should not be allowed to perform. This can lead to a wide range of problems, including information exposures, denial of service, and arbitrary code execution.


### Alternative Terms
AuthZ: "AuthZ" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authorization" within the web application security community. It is distinct from "AuthN" (or, sometimes, "AuthC") which is an abbreviation of "authentication." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.

### Relationships

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-285 is high-level and lower-level CWEs can frequently be used instead. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
**Comments:** Look at CWE-285's children and consider mapping to CWEs such as CWE-862: Missing Authorization, CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization, CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource, or others.
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction
**Suggested Alternatives:**
- CWE-862: Missing Authorization
- CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization
- CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-24730:** Go-based continuous deployment product does not check that a user has certain privileges to update or create an app, allowing adversaries to read sensitive repository information
- **CVE-2009-3168:** Web application does not restrict access to admin scripts, allowing authenticated users to reset administrative passwords.
- **CVE-2009-2960:** Web application does not restrict access to admin scripts, allowing authenticated users to modify passwords of other users.




## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.

### Extended Description


There are many different kinds of mistakes that introduce information exposures. The severity of the error can range widely, depending on the context in which the product operates, the type of sensitive information that is revealed, and the benefits it may provide to an attacker. Some kinds of sensitive information include:


  - private, personal information, such as personal messages, financial data, health records, geographic location, or contact details

  - system status and environment, such as the operating system and installed packages

  - business secrets and intellectual property

  - network status and configuration

  - the product's own code or internal state

  - metadata, e.g. logging of connections or message headers

  - indirect information, such as a discrepancy between two internal operations that can be observed by an outsider

Information might be sensitive to different parties, each of which may have their own expectations for whether the information should be protected. These parties include:

  - the product's own users

  - people or organizations whose information is created or used by the product, even if they are not direct product users

  - the product's administrators, including the admins of the system(s) and/or networks on which the product operates

  - the developer

Information exposures can occur in different ways:

  - the code  **explicitly inserts**  sensitive information into resources or messages that are intentionally made accessible to unauthorized actors, but should not contain the information - i.e., the information should have been "scrubbed" or "sanitized"

  - a different weakness or mistake  **indirectly inserts**  the sensitive information into resources, such as a web script error revealing the full system path of the program.

  - the code manages resources that intentionally contain sensitive information, but the resources are  **unintentionally made accessible**  to unauthorized actors. In this case, the information exposure is resultant - i.e., a different weakness enabled the access to the information in the first place.

It is common practice to describe any loss of confidentiality as an "information exposure," but this can lead to overuse of CWE-200 in CWE mapping. From the CWE perspective, loss of confidentiality is a technical impact that can arise from dozens of different weaknesses, such as insecure file permissions or out-of-bounds read. CWE-200 and its lower-level descendants are intended to cover the mistakes that occur in behaviors that explicitly manage, store, transfer, or cleanse sensitive information.

### Alternative Terms
Information Disclosure: This term is frequently used in vulnerability advisories to describe a consequence or technical impact, for any vulnerability that has a loss of confidentiality. Often, CWE-200 can be misused to represent the loss of confidentiality, even when the mistake - i.e., the weakness - is not directly related to the mishandling of the information itself, such as an out-of-bounds read that accesses sensitive memory contents; here, the out-of-bounds read is the primary weakness, not the disclosure of the memory. In addition, this phrase is also used frequently in policies and legal documents, but it does not refer to any disclosure of security-relevant information.
Information Leak: This is a frequently used term, however the "leak" term has multiple uses within security. In some cases it deals with the accidental exposure of information from a different weakness, but in other cases (such as "memory leak"), this deals with improper tracking of resources, which can lead to exhaustion. As a result, CWE is actively avoiding usage of the "leak" term.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-668

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-200 is commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error. As of CWE 4.9, over 400 CWE entries can lead to a loss of confidentiality. Other options are often available. [REF-1287].
**Comments:** If an error or mistake causes information to be disclosed, then use the CWE ID for that error. Consider starting with improper authorization (CWE-285), insecure permissions (CWE-732), improper authentication (CWE-287), etc. Also consider children such as Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data (CWE-201), Observable Discrepancy (CWE-203), Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory (CWE-538), or others.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** As a result of mapping analysis in the 2020 Top 25 and more recent versions, this weakness is under review, since it is frequently misused in mapping to cover many problems that lead to loss of confidentiality. See Mapping Notes, Extended Description, and Alternate Terms.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-31162:** Rust library leaks Oauth client details in application debug logs
- **CVE-2021-25476:** Digital Rights Management (DRM) capability for mobile platform leaks pointer information, simplifying ASLR bypass
- **CVE-2001-1483:** Enumeration of valid usernames based on inconsistent responses




## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Denylist / Deny List: This is used by CWE and CAPEC instead of other commonly-used terms. Its counterpart is allowlist.
Blocklist / Block List: This is often used by security tools such as firewalls, email or web gateways, proxies, etc.
Blacklist / Black List: This term is frequently used, but usage has been declining as organizations have started to adopt other terms.

ChildOf -> CWE-693
ChildOf -> CWE-1023
CanPrecede -> CWE-79
CanPrecede -> CWE-78
CanPrecede -> CWE-434
CanPrecede -> CWE-98

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** 

Multiple interpretation errors can indirectly introduce inputs that should be disallowed. For example, a list of dangerous shell metacharacters might not include a metacharacter that only has meaning in one particular shell, not all of them; or a check for XSS manipulations might ignore an unusual construct that is supported by one web browser, but not others.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2024-4315:** Chain: API for text generation using Large Language Models (LLMs) does not include the "\" Windows folder separator in its denylist (CWE-184) when attempting to prevent Local File Inclusion via path traversal (CWE-22), allowing deletion of arbitrary files on Windows systems.
- **CVE-2008-2309:** product uses a denylist to identify potentially dangerous content, allowing attacker to bypass a warning
- **CVE-2005-2782:** PHP remote file inclusion in web application that filters "http" and "https" URLs, but not "ftp".




## CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm or protocol.

### Extended Description


Cryptographic algorithms are the methods by which data is scrambled to prevent observation or influence by unauthorized actors. Insecure cryptography can be exploited to expose sensitive information, modify data in unexpected ways, spoof identities of other users or devices, or other impacts.


It is very difficult to produce a secure algorithm, and even high-profile algorithms by accomplished cryptographic experts have been broken. Well-known techniques exist to break or weaken various kinds of cryptography. Accordingly, there are a small number of well-understood and heavily studied algorithms that should be used by most products. Using a non-standard or known-insecure algorithm is dangerous because a determined adversary may be able to break the algorithm and compromise whatever data has been protected.


Since the state of cryptography advances so rapidly, it is common for an algorithm to be considered "unsafe" even if it was once thought to be strong. This can happen when new attacks are discovered, or if computing power increases so much that the cryptographic algorithm no longer provides the amount of protection that was originally thought.


For a number of reasons, this weakness is even more challenging to manage with hardware deployment of cryptographic algorithms as opposed to software implementation. First, if a flaw is discovered with hardware-implemented cryptography, the flaw cannot be fixed in most cases without a recall of the product, because hardware is not easily replaceable like software. Second, because the hardware product is expected to work for years, the adversary's computing power will only increase over time.


### Alternative Terms

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** Since CWE 4.4, various cryptography-related entries, including CWE-327 and CWE-1240, have been slated for extensive research, analysis, and community consultation to define consistent terminology, improve relationships, and reduce overlap or duplication. As of CWE 4.6, this work is still ongoing.

**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-30273:** SCADA-based protocol supports a legacy encryption mode that uses Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA) in ECB mode, which leaks patterns in messages and cannot protect integrity
- **CVE-2022-30320:** Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) uses a protocol with a cryptographically insecure hashing algorithm for passwords.
- **CVE-2008-3775:** Product uses "ROT-25" to obfuscate the password in the registry.




## CWE-1336: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses a template engine to insert or process externally-influenced input, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements or syntax that can be interpreted as template expressions or other code directives when processed by the engine.

### Extended Description


Many web applications use template engines that allow developers to insert externally-influenced values into free text or messages in order to generate a full web page, document, message, etc. Such engines include Twig, Jinja2, Pug, Java Server Pages, FreeMarker, Velocity, ColdFusion, Smarty, and many others - including PHP itself. Some CMS (Content Management Systems) also use templates.


Template engines often have their own custom command or expression language. If an attacker can influence input into a template before it is processed, then the attacker can invoke arbitrary expressions, i.e. perform injection attacks. For example, in some template languages, an attacker could inject the expression "{{7*7}}" and determine if the output returns "49" instead. The syntax varies depending on the language.


In some cases, XSS-style attacks can work, which can obscure the root cause if the developer does not closely investigate the root cause of the error.


Template engines can be used on the server or client, so both "sides" could be affected by injection. The mechanisms of attack or the affected technologies might be different, but the mistake is fundamentally the same.


### Alternative Terms
Server-Side Template Injection / SSTI: This term is used for injection into template engines being used by a server.
Client-Side Template Injection / CSTI: This term is used for injection into template engines being used by a client.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-94

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Since expression languages are often used in templating languages, there may be some overlap with CWE-917 (Expression Language Injection). XSS (CWE-79) is also co-located with template injection.

**[Maintenance]** The interrelationships and differences between CWE-917 and CWE-1336 need to be further clarified.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2024-34359:** Chain: Python bindings for LLM library do not use a sandboxed environment when parsing a template and constructing a prompt, allowing jinja2 Server Side Template Injection and code execution - one variant of a "prompt injection" attack.
- **CVE-2017-16783:** server-side template injection in content management server
- **CVE-2020-9437:** authentication / identity management product has client-side template injection
