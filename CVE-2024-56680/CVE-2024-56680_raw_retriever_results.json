  "query": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved media intel/ipu6 do not handle interrupts when device is disabled Some IPU6 devices have shared interrupts. We need to handle properly case when interrupt is triggered from other device on shared irq line and IPU6 itself disabled. In such case we get 0xffffffff from ISR_STATUS register and handle all irqs cases, for what we are not not prepared and usually hang the whole system. To avoid the issue use pm_runtime_get_if_active() to check if the device is enabled and prevent suspending it when we handle irq until the end of irq. Additionally use synchronize_irq() in suspend",
