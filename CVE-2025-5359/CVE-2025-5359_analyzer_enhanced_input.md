## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The content relates to CVE-2025-5359. Here's the extracted information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   A SQL injection vulnerability was found in the '/hms/appointment-history.php' file of the 'Online Hospital Management System' project. The reason for this issue is that attackers inject malicious code from the parameter 'id' and use it directly in SQL queries without the need for appropriate cleaning or validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   SQL injection

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Attackers can exploit this SQL injection vulnerability to achieve unauthorized database access, sensitive data leakage, data tampering, comprehensive system control, and even service interruption.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The 'id' parameter in `/hms/appointment-history.php` is vulnerable.
*   No login or authorization is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to craft and send malicious SQL queries through the 'id' parameter. No authentication is required.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   Use prepared statements and parameter binding.
*   Input validation and filtering.
*   Minimize database user permissions.
*   Regular security audits.

**Payload Example:**

```
Parameter: id (GET)
    Type: time-based blind
    Title: MySQL >= 5.0.12 AND time-based blind (query SLEEP)
    Payload: id=8' AND (SELECT 2739 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))Ovbe) AND 'SvXf'='SvXf&cancel=update
```
