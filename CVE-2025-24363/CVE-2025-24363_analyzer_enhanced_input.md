## Vulnerability Description
The HL7 FHIR IG publisher is a tool to take a set of inputs and create a standard FHIR IG. Prior to version 1.8.9, in CI contexts, the IG Publisher CLI uses git commands to determine the URL of the originating repo. If the repo was cloned, or otherwise set to use a repo that uses a **username and credential based URL**, the entire URL will be included in the built Implementation Guide, exposing username and credential. This does not impact users that clone public repos without credentials, such as those using the auto-ig-build continuous integration infrastructure. This problem has been patched in release 1.8.9. Some workarounds are available. Users should ensure the IG repo they are publishing does not have username or credentials included in the `origin` URL. Running the command `git remote origin url` should return a URL that contains no username, password, or token or users should run the IG Publisher CLI with the `-repo` parameter and specify a URL that contains no username, password, or token.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **product:** HL7 FHIR IG publisher
- **version:** prior to version 1.8.9

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## CVE-2025-24363 Analysis

The provided content is directly related to CVE-2025-24363. It details a vulnerability in the HL7 FHIR IG Publisher, specifically regarding the potential exposure of GitHub credentials.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The IG Publisher CLI uses git commands to determine the repository URL. If the repository was cloned using a URL containing a username and credential (e.g., `https://username:password@github.com/org/repo`), this entire URL, including the credentials, was included in the generated Implementation Guide (IG) and stored in database metadata.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Credential Exposure:** Storing credentials in plain text within the IG and database.
*   **Insecure Git URL Handling:**  The application doesn't sanitize or redact credentials from the Git repository URL.

**Impact of exploitation:**

Exposure of GitHub usernames and passwords/tokens, allowing unauthorized access to the repository.

**Attack vectors:**

*   CI/CD pipelines using repositories cloned with credential-based URLs.
*   Any scenario where the IG Publisher CLI processes a repository with credentials in the `origin` URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   Access to the generated Implementation Guide (IG) or the database where metadata is stored.
*   No specific privileges are required to *exploit* the vulnerability, only to *access* the exposed credentials.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   **Update to version 1.8.9 or later:** This version includes a patch to prevent the inclusion of credentials in the IG and database.
*   **Workaround 1:** Ensure the IG repository's `origin` URL does not contain usernames or credentials. Use `git remote origin url` to verify.
*   **Workaround 2:** Use the `-repo` parameter with the IG Publisher CLI and specify a URL without credentials.

**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**

*   The release notes specifically mention a bug fix related to removing credentials from repo source URLs in both JSON and database files.
*   The commit message associated with the fix (`7e77066`) confirms the purpose of the change.
*   The CVSS score is provided as Moderate (4.2/10) with a breakdown of the base metrics: AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by pat-ryan-health.
