This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of PDF-XChange Editor. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of PDF files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-24553.', key_phrases={'rootcause': 'lack of proper validation of user-supplied data', 'weakness': ['Information Disclosure Vulnerability', 'Out-Of-Bounds Read'], 'impact': ['Information Disclosure', 'disclose sensitive information', 'execute arbitrary code'], 'vector': 'malicious page or file', 'attacker': 'remote attackers', 'product': 'PDF-XChange Editor', 'version': '', 'component': 'PDF File Parsing'}, reference_content=\"Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\\n\\n*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of PDF files. This leads to a read operation that goes beyond the bounds of an allocated buffer.\\n*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The core weakness is an out-of-bounds read vulnerability due to insufficient input validation in the PDF file parsing logic.\\n*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to disclose sensitive information. It is also mentioned that this vulnerability can be leveraged with other vulnerabilities to achieve arbitrary code execution within the context of the current process.\\n*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector involves a malicious PDF file or a malicious web page that triggers the vulnerable PDF parsing functionality in PDF-XChange Editor. User interaction is required, as the target must either open the malicious PDF file or visit a malicious page.\\n*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious PDF file or host a malicious page that can be accessed by the user.\\n\\n**Summary:**\\nThe vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read in PDF-XChange Editor due to insufficient input validation when parsing PDF files. This can lead to information disclosure and potentially be chained with other vulnerabilities to achieve code execution. An attacker needs to entice a victim into opening a specially crafted PDF or visit a malicious webpage.\", similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {95: {'cwe_counts': defaultdict(<class 'int'>, {'CWE-125':

    "enhanced_query": "# Vulnerability Description\n\n    PDF-XChange Editor PDF File Parsing **Out-Of-Bounds Read** **Information Disclosure Vulnerability**. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of PDF-XChange Editor. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of PDF files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-24553.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'lack of proper validation of user-supplied data'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1.
