  "description": "PDF-XChange Editor PDF File Parsing **Out-Of-Bounds Read** **Information Disclosure Vulnerability**. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of PDF-XChange Editor. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of PDF files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-24553.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of PDF files. This leads to a read operation that goes beyond the bounds of an allocated buffer.\n*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The core weakness is an out-of-bounds read vulnerability due to insufficient input validation in the PDF file parsing logic.\n*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to disclose sensitive information. It is also mentioned that this vulnerability can be leveraged with other vulnerabilities to achieve arbitrary code execution within the context of the current process.\n*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector involves a malicious PDF file or a malicious web page that triggers the vulnerable PDF parsing functionality in PDF-XChange Editor. User interaction is required, as the target must either open the malicious PDF file or visit a malicious page.\n*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious PDF file or host a malicious page that can be accessed by the user.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read in PDF-XChange Editor due to insufficient input validation when parsing PDF files. This can lead to information disclosure and potentially be chained with other vulnerabilities to achieve code execution. An attacker needs to entice a victim into opening a specially crafted PDF or visit a malicious webpage.",

The **ROOTCAUSE** is **CWE-20: Improper Input Validation**, which allows the out-of-bounds read to occur.\n\nThe evidence supports these mappings with high confidence. The retriever results also listed both CWEs as highly relevant.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-788: Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads or writes to a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location after the end of the buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: The CWE entry might be misused when lower-level CWE entries might be available. It also overlaps existing CWE entries and might be deprecated in the future.\n\n*Not Used:* This is similar to CWE-125 but less specific. The description explicitly mentions reading *or* writing, while this vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read.\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Used:* This is not the root cause. The issue is a lack of validation on user-supplied data.\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Used:* This describes the impact but not the root cause.\n\n## CWE-129: Improper Validation of Array Index\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses untrusted input when calculating or using an array index, but the product does not validate or incorrectly validates the index to ensure the index references a valid position within the array.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Used:* While related to input validation, it focuses specifically on array indices.
