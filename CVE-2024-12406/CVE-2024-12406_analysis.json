  "description": "The Library Management System Manage e-Digital Books Library plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the owt7_borrow_books_id parameter in all versions up to, and including, 3.0.0 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-12406:\n\n**1. Verification:**\n   - The provided Wordfence content explicitly mentions **CVE-2024-12406** and describes a SQL Injection vulnerability in the \"Library Management System\" WordPress plugin, matching the CVE ID. Therefore the content is relevant.\n\n**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n   - The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input (`owt7_borrow_books_id` parameter) combined with a lack of proper preparation of the SQL query.\n\n**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n    - **SQL Injection:** The plugin directly incorporates user-supplied data into a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.\n\n**4. Impact of Exploitation:**\n   - **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can inject malicious SQL code, potentially extracting sensitive information from the database.\n\n**5. Attack Vectors:**\n    - **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is exploited via a specially crafted HTTP request targeting the vulnerable parameter (`owt7_borrow_books_id`).\n\n**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n    - **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least \"Subscriber\" level privileges.\n    - **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the WordPress site to send malicious requests.\n\n**Additional Notes**\n   - The provided code snippet from the plugin's `class-library-management-system-admin.php` file includes a section (lines 1874-1945) that handles the \"owt7_lms_return_book\" action. This section seems to be the vulnerable location, as it uses the `$_REQUEST['owt7_borrow_books_id']` parameter. This parameter is used in line 1881 for a select statement, which can be manipulated using the sql injection. The code snippet provides additional context which supports the information given by Wordfence.\n   - The Wordfence article states that there is no patch available for the plugin, and recommends mitigating the risk by uninstalling the plugin.\n\nThis analysis provides more detail than a standard CVE description, including the vulnerable parameter, user role requirements, and a link to the affected source code line.",
