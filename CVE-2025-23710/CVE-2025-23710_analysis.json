The impact of this attack is that it allows for stored XSS (CWE-79).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    \n    cwe79 <--|CANFOLLOW| cwe352\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe352 primary\n    class cwe79 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of CSRF protection** (CWE-352), which then leads to the ability to inject malicious code, resulting in Stored **XSS** (CWE-79).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states a **lack of CSRF protection**, leading to Stored **XSS**. The CVE reference summary confirms the **root cause** as a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability. The presence of a CSRF vulnerability allows for higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication, in this case, leading to stored XSS. Therefore, the primary CWE is CWE-352. The resulting **XSS** is a consequence of the **lack of CSRF protection** and is classified as CWE-79.
