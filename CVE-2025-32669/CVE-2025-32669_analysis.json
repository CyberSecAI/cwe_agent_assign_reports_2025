In this case, the CSRF vulnerability leads to Stored XSS (CWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')]).\nThe graph shows that CWE-352 [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)] can follow CWE-1275 [Sensitive Cookie with Improper SameSite Attribute] and requires CWE-346 [Origin Validation Error].\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe1275[\"CWE-1275: Sensitive Cookie with Improper SameSite Attribute\"]\n    cwe346[\"CWE-346: Origin Validation Error\"]\n\n    cwe352 -->|CAN_LEAD_TO| cwe79\n    cwe1275 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe352\n    cwe346 -->|REQUIRES| cwe352\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe352 primary\n    class cwe79 secondary\n    class cwe1275,cwe346 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** vulnerability (CWE-352 [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)]).
