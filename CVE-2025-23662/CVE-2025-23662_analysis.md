# Analysis for CVE-2025-23662

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-352 | Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) | 0.9 | Compound | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-79 | Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') | 0.8 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship considered is that **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**, CWE-352, can lead to other vulnerabilities such as **Cross-site Scripting (XSS)**, CWE-79. The CSRF attack forces a user to perform actions they did not intend to, and if the application does not properly neutralize input, it can result in stored XSS. CWE-352 is a compound weakness, while CWE-79 is a base weakness.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with a **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** vulnerability, CWE-352. This allows an attacker to force a user to perform unwanted actions. If the application then fails to properly neutralize input, this leads to **Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')**, CWE-79, resulting in Stored XSS.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis identified **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**, CWE-352, as the primary root cause, which aligns with the vulnerability description that explicitly mentions CSRF. The secondary weakness is **Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')**, CWE-79, as the CSRF allows for the injection of malicious scripts.

The evidence for CWE-352 is strong, as the description mentions a "**Cross-Site Request Forgery** (CSRF) vulnerability". The evidence for CWE-79, while not explicitly stated as a root cause, is implied by the fact that the CSRF leads to Stored XSS, indicating that input neutralization is not being properly handled.

The graph relationships show that CSRF can precede XSS, further supporting the inclusion of both CWEs. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-352 being a compound weakness, and CWE-79 being a base weakness.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
**Abstraction Level**: Compound
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.



## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as "<", ">", and "&" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.67
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
