The integer overflow leads to an incorrect buffer size calculation, resulting in the out-of-bounds write. CWE-190 is the root cause (Base level) and CWE-787 is a consequence (Base level).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe190[\"CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n\n    cwe190 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe787\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe190 primary\n    class cwe787 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **integer overflow** (CWE-190), leading to an incorrect buffer size calculation and then an **out-of-bounds write** (CWE-787), resulting in potential escalation of privilege.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states an **integer overflow** leading to an **out of bounds write**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that \"A size overflow check was missing before allocating SkMask data\", and the \"Integer overflow leading to heap overflow\". This evidence strongly supports CWE-190 as the primary root cause, which can lead to CWE-787.\n\nThe Retriever Results also list CWE-190 with a high score, further reinforcing this assessment. The provided mapping guidance allows for CWE-190.\n\nThe description matches CWE-190's characteristics as the **integer overflow** is the calculation error that causes a value to become smaller than expected. This leads to an undersized buffer allocation, which is followed by an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787). CWE-787 directly results from the **integer overflow** because the overflow results in writing beyond the allocated buffer, which corrupts the heap and can lead to privilege escalation.\n\nCWE-128 (Wrap-around Error) was considered as an alternative, since it is a peer of CWE-190, but CWE-190 is more descriptive. Other candidates were not specific enough, were higher level Classes, or did not apply to this specific vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
