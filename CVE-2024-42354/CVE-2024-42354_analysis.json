  "description": "Shopware is an open commerce platform. The store-API works with regular entities and not expose all fields for the public API fields need to be marked as ApiAware in the EntityDefinition. So only ApiAware fields of the EntityDefinition will be encoded to the final JSON. Prior to versions 6.6.5.1 and 6.5.8.13, the processing of the Criteria did not considered ManyToMany associations and so they were not considered properly and the protections didnt get used. This issue cannot be reproduced with the default entities by Shopware, but can be triggered with extensions. Update to Shopware 6.6.5.1 or 6.5.8.13 to receive a patch. For older versions of 6.2, 6.3, and 6.4, corresponding security measures are also available via a plugin.",

While more specific base-level CWEs exist under it, the provided information doesn't pinpoint the exact mechanism of authorization failure, making the class-level CWE the most appropriate. CWE-200, \"Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor,\" is considered a secondary candidate as it represents the impact of the authorization failure. CWE-425, \"Direct Request ('Forced Browsing'),\" is another potential candidate as it relates to bypassing authorization checks on restricted resources.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe425[\"CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\"]\n\n    cwe425 -->|CHILDOF| cwe863\n    cwe200 -->|IMPACT| cwe863\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe200,cwe425 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper processing of ManyToMany associations**, leading to **incorrect authorization**, and ultimately resulting in the **exposure of sensitive information**.\n\nInitial Flaw: **Improper processing of ManyToMany associations** in store-API criteria.\n|\nLeads to: Incorrect Authorization (CWE-863) due to bypassed `ApiAware` field protections.\n|\nResults in: Exposure of Sensitive Information (CWE-200) through the store-API.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis indicates that the root cause is related to **improper processing of ManyToMany associations** in the Shopware store-API, as stated in the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\". The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" also highlights that \"The store-API was not properly considering ManyToMany associations when processing criteria, leading to potential exposure of non-ApiAware fields.\" This **rootcause** leads to an authorization bypass because the intended protections for `ApiAware` fields are not applied correctly. This bypass, in turn, leads to the exposure of sensitive information.\n\nCWE-863, \"Incorrect Authorization,\" is chosen as the primary CWE because it directly reflects the core issue of the vulnerability. The system is intended to authorize access based on the `ApiAware` designation, but this authorization process fails due to the **improper processing of ManyToMany associations**. The retriever results also list CWE-863 as the top candidate.\n\nCWE-200, \"Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor,\" is a secondary consideration because it represents the impact of the vulnerability rather than the **rootcause**. While the vulnerability ultimately leads to information exposure, the underlying problem is the authorization failure. The mapping guidance for CWE-200 discourages its use as a primary CWE when a more specific cause is identifiable.\n\nCWE-425, \"Direct Request ('Forced Browsing'),\" is considered because the vulnerability can be seen as a failure to adequately enforce authorization on restricted resources (the `ApiAware` fields). However, the **rootcause** is more precisely described by the **improper processing** that leads to the authorization failure captured by CWE-863.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at an appropriate level of specificity. CWE-863 is a class-level CWE, but it's the most accurate representation of the authorization problem given the available information. More specific base-level CWEs under CWE-863 might exist, but the vulnerability description lacks the detail needed to pinpoint the exact authorization mechanism that is failing.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product generates an error message that includes sensitive information about its environment, users, or associated data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Used:* This CWE doesn't fit the vulnerability description, as the issue is not about error messages.\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Secondary Candidate:* As mentioned above, this is a candidate since the store-API doesn't adequately enforce authorization of `ApiAware` fields.\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Used:* This CWE doesn't fit the vulnerability description, as the issue is not about user-controlled keys.\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Used:* This CWE is too broad, as it is not about sensitive system information, rather it is about sensitive information due to authorization bypass of store-API entities.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
