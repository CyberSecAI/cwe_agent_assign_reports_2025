## Vulnerability Description
tgt (aka Linux target framework) before 1.0.93 attempts to achieve entropy by calling rand without srand. The PRNG seed is always 1, and thus the sequence of challenges is always identical.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **uses rand() without srand()**
- **impact:** predictable sequence of challenges
- **product:** tgt (Linux target framework)
- **version:** before 1.0.93

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-45751:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The iSCSI target daemon in the Linux target framework (tgt) uses the `rand()` function without proper seeding (`srand()`) to generate CHAP authentication challenges. This results in a predictable sequence of "random" numbers, as `rand()` defaults to the equivalent of `srand(1)`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Use of Cryptographically Weak PRNG (CWE-338):**  The vulnerability stems from the use of a non-cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator (`rand()`) for generating CHAP challenges. The predictable nature of the generated challenges makes the system vulnerable to replay attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **CHAP authentication bypass:** An attacker can record network traffic between the iSCSI target and initiator and use previously observed challenges and responses to bypass CHAP authentication.
- **Full user privileges:** Successfully bypassing CHAP authentication gives the attacker full user privileges, allowing them to modify the iSCSI target at will within the user privileges.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Network traffic monitoring:** The attacker needs to be able to monitor or record network traffic between the iSCSI target and initiator.
- **Replay Attack:** The attacker replays a captured CHAP authentication exchange after the service or server has restarted to gain unauthorized access.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Network access:** The attacker must have network access to the communication channel between the iSCSI target and initiator.
- **Traffic capture:** The attacker must be able to capture and record the network traffic containing the CHAP authentication exchange.
- **Replay capability:** The attacker needs to be able to replay the recorded authentication sequence.
