The SOFA Hessian protocol uses a blacklist mechanism to restrict **deserialization** of potentially dangerous classes for security protection. But there is a gadget chain that can **bypass the SOFA Hessian blacklist protection mechanism**, and this gadget chain only relies on JDK and does not rely on any third-party components. This issue is fixed by an update to the blacklist, users can upgrade to sofahessian version 3.5.5 to avoid this issue.

This chain relies only on the JDK and not any third-party libraries.\\n- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Inadequate blacklist protection mechanism for deserialization, allowing bypass via a

    "enhanced_query": "# Vulnerability Description\n\n    sofa-hessian is an internal improved version of Hessian3/4 powered by Ant Group CO., Ltd. The SOFA Hessian protocol uses a blacklist mechanism to restrict **deserialization** of potentially dangerous classes for security protection. But there is a gadget chain that can **bypass the SOFA Hessian blacklist protection mechanism**, and this gadget chain only relies on JDK and does not rely on any third-party components. This issue is fixed by an update to the blacklist, users can upgrade to sofahessian version 3.5.5 to avoid this issue. Users unable to upgrade may maintain a blacklist themselves in the directory `external/serialize.blacklist`.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## WEAKNESS: 'bypass the SOFA Hessian blacklist protection mechanism'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this WEAKNESS:\n\n### 1.
