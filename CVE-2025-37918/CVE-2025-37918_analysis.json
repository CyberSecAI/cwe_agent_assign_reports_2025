The other CWEs listed in the retriever results are either too general (Class level) or not directly supported by the description.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe476[\"CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference\"]\n    cwe754[\"CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions\"]\n    \n    cwe476 -->|CHILDOF| cwe754\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe476 primary\n    class cwe754 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward: a **NULL pointer dereference** in the `skb_dequeue()` function leads to a system crash. The root cause is the **NULL pointer dereference** itself (CWE-476).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states \"**NULL pointer dereference** in skb_dequeue()\". The primary CWE is therefore CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference). This aligns with the retriever results, where CWE-476 is the top-ranked CWE. The description directly points to the root cause, leaving little room for ambiguity. The selection is at the base level of abstraction, which is appropriate for a root cause. Other CWEs were considered but not selected because they do not directly address the root cause described in the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe
