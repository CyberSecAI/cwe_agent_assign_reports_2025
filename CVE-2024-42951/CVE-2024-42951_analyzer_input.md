## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `decodePwd` function within the `fromWizardHandle` function is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow. The function copies data from a user-controlled input `mit_pptpusrpw` into a local buffer without sufficient bounds checking, which could allow an attacker to overwrite stack data.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution on the affected device.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered via an HTTP POST request to the `/goform/WizardHandle` endpoint with specific parameters, including the `mit_pptpusrpw` parameter that contains the overflow payload.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable device, requiring network access to the device."
