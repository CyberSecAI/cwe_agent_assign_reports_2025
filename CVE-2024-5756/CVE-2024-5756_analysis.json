  "description": "The Email Subscribers by Icegram Express - Email Marketing, Newsletters, Automation for WordPress & WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to **time-based SQL Injection** via the db parameter in all versions up to, and including, 5.7.23 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-5756:\n\n**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**\n\nThe provided content explicitly mentions CVE-2024-5756 and describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the \"Email Subscribers by Icegram Express\" WordPress plugin. This confirms the relevance of the content to the specified CVE.\n\n**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\nThe root cause of the vulnerability is insufficient input sanitization and lack of proper preparation in an SQL query. Specifically, the `db` parameter in the plugin is not properly escaped before being used in a SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.\n\n**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is an unauthenticated time-based SQL injection. The plugin fails to sanitize the `db` parameter, allowing malicious SQL code to be inserted and executed.\n\n**4. Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Sensitive Data Extraction:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows attackers to extract sensitive information from the WordPress database, including potentially user data, admin credentials, and other confidential information.\n*   **Complete System Compromise:** With the ability to execute arbitrary SQL commands, attackers can potentially modify or delete data and potentially escalate to take complete control of the WordPress website.\n\n**5. Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Unauthenticated HTTP Requests:** The vulnerability is accessible to unauthenticated attackers, making exploitation easier. Attackers can send crafted HTTP requests containing malicious SQL code in the `db` parameter to trigger the vulnerability.\n*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** The `db` parameter is the direct injection point, making the attack vector clear.\n\n**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the target WordPress site.\n*   **No Authentication:** The attacker does not need any authentication to exploit the vulnerability. They can directly send malicious requests to the vulnerable endpoint.\n*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker must know the name of the vulnerable parameter (`db`) to exploit this.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n*   **Affected Versions:** The vulnerability affects all versions of the \"Email Subscribers by Icegram Express\" plugin up to and including 5.7.23.\n*   **Patched Version:** The vulnerability is patched in version 5.7.24 and later.\n*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a critical CVSS score of 9.8.\n*   **Time-Based SQL Injection:** The Wordfence article describes the vulnerability as time-based, meaning attackers can use time delays to confirm and extract data from the database.\n*   **Code Change:** The provided Trac changeset shows that the vulnerable code was using `implode( ',', ~~$ids~~ )` to create an id string, and it was changed to use `implode( ',', array_map( 'absint', $ids ) )`, which is a fix for SQL injection, ensuring that IDs are integers.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nCVE-2024-5756 is a critical SQL injection vulnerability in the \"Email Subscribers by Icegram Express\" WordPress plugin. It allows unauthenticated attackers to inject malicious SQL code via the `db` parameter, leading to potential data breaches and complete system compromise. It is crucial to update to the patched version (5.7.24 or later) to mitigate this risk.",
