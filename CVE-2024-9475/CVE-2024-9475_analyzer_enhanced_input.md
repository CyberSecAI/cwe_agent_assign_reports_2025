## Vulnerability Description
The Poll Maker - Versus Polls, Anonymous Polls, Image Polls plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to generic SQL Injection via the order_by parameter in all versions up to, and including, 5.4.6 due to **insufficient escaping** on the user-supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **insufficient escaping**
- **weakness:** **SQL injection**
- **impact:** extract sensitive information from the database
- **attacker:** authenticated attackers with admin privileges
- **product:** Poll Maker - Versus Polls
- **version:** up to and including 5.4.6
- **component:** order_by parameter

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization and escaping of the `order_by` parameter within the `class-poll-maker-each-results-poll-list-table.php` file of the Poll Maker plugin. Specifically, the `esc_sql()` function is used, which is not sufficient to prevent SQL injection in this context.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The plugin is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `order_by` parameter. The lack of proper sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to extract sensitive data from the database by appending additional SQL queries.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The `order_by` parameter, passed through an HTTP request, is the attack vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated as an administrator or have higher privileges to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional details:**

* The vulnerable code is located within the `get_results` function of the `Pma_Each_Results_List_Table` class.
* The `order_by` parameter is used to dynamically construct the SQL query's `ORDER BY` clause.
* The vulnerability exists in all versions of the Poll Maker plugin up to and including 5.4.6.
* The vulnerability has been patched in version 5.4.7.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set ‚Äì Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* üîç *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* üîç *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion ‚Äì CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### üî∏ CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ‚úÖ *‚ÄúA user created with the ‚Äòguest‚Äô role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.‚Äù*

#### üî∏ CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ‚úÖ *‚ÄúThe backup service runs as root but only needs read access.‚Äù*

#### üî∏ CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### üî∏ CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ‚úÖ *‚ÄúUser can access another user‚Äôs invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.‚Äù*

## Mapping Examples ‚Äì Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *‚ÄúUser can escalate privileges to admin.‚Äù*
> ‚ùå Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged ‚Äì only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ‚úÖ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**
