  "query": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved HID pidff Fix null pointer dereference in pidff_find_fields This function triggered a null pointer dereference if used to search for a report that isnt implemented on the device. This happened both for optional and required reports alike. The same logic was applied to pidff_find_special_field and although pidff_init_fields should return an error earlier if one of the required reports is missing, future modifications could change this logic and resurface this possible null pointer dereference again.
