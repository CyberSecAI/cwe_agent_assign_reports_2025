  "description": "MyDumper is a MySQL Logical Backup Tool. The MySQL C client library (libmysqlclient) allows authenticated remote actors to read arbitrary files from client systems via a crafted server response to **LOAD LOCAL INFILE query**, leading to sensitive information disclosure when clients connect to untrusted MySQL servers without explicitly disabling the local infile capability. Mydumper has the local infile option enabled by default and does not have an option to disable it. This can lead to an unexpected arbitrary file read if the Mydumper tool connects to an untrusted server. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.18.2-8.",

The GitHub advisory explicitly mentions the CVE ID and details a vulnerability in mydumper related to the MySQL client library. The Debian security announcement also references the CVE ID and confirms a security update for mydumper.\n\n**2. Extracted Information:**\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe root cause is a vulnerability in the MySQL C client library (libmysqlclient) that allows authenticated remote actors to read arbitrary files from client systems via a crafted server response to a `LOAD LOCAL INFILE` query.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   The MySQL C client library is vulnerable to arbitrary file read.\n*   Mydumper has the `local_infile` option enabled by default and lacks a mechanism to disable it.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   Sensitive information disclosure.\n*   Arbitrary file read from the client system.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   A crafted server response to a `LOAD LOCAL INFILE` query.\n*   Connecting Mydumper to an untrusted MySQL server.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   Authenticated remote actor (access to the MySQL server).\n*   Ability to craft a malicious server response.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   Upgrade mydumper to version 0.10.1-1+deb11u1 (Debian 11 bullseye).\n*   The GitHub advisory suggests introducing a `--local-infile` option to mydumper, similar to the MySQL client, to allow disabling the feature.\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   **Proof-of-Concept:** The GitHub advisory provides a detailed proof-of-concept demonstrating the vulnerability using Docker and a MySQL server with the `local_infile` option enabled and a query rewriter plugin.\n*   **CVSS Score:** The GitHub advisory includes a CVSS v3 score of 6.8 (Moderate).\n*   **CVSS Metrics:** Detailed breakdown of CVSS v3 base metrics (Attack Vector, Attack Complexity, Privileges Required, User Interaction, Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability).\n*   **References:** A link to a Medium article detailing the attack chain is provided.\n*   **Debian Specifics:** The Debian announcement specifies the affected version (0.10.1-1+deb11u1) and the Debian bug number (#1102002).\n*   **PGP Signature:** The Debian announcement includes a PGP signature for verification.",

It has child CWEs that are more specific, but the provided information doesn't give enough detail to choose a specific child. CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) could be a related weakness, as the crafted server response is a form of malicious input. It is a class-level CWE, and a specific child could be a better fit if more information was available. CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) is also a possibility as the client connects to an untrusted server. The graph shows that CWE-306 is a child of CWE-287 (Improper Authentication), which is a class that is discouraged, so sticking with CWE-306 seems appropriate.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Design or Implementation\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    \n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe20,cwe306 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a crafted server response containing the **LOAD LOCAL INFILE query**. The Mydumper tool connects to an untrusted server without proper authentication or input validation, and then reads arbitrary files due to the **weakness** in the MySQL client library leading to sensitive information disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary assessment is based on the vulnerability description and CVE reference summary. The key evidence is that the MySQL client library allows authenticated remote actors to read arbitrary files from client systems via a crafted server response to **LOAD LOCAL INFILE query**, leading to sensitive information disclosure when clients connect to untrusted MySQL servers. The Mydumper tool has the local infile option enabled by default and does not have an option to disable it. This can lead to an unexpected arbitrary file read if the Mydumper tool connects to an untrusted server.\n\nI am overriding the retriever results which suggested CWE-863, CWE-770, CWE-923, CWE-306, CWE-347, CWE-862, CWE-287, CWE-201, CWE-619, and CWE-322 because CWE-200 more accurately captures the overall vulnerability. While some of the other CWEs are related, they do not fully describe the root cause and impact of the vulnerability.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity based on the available information.
