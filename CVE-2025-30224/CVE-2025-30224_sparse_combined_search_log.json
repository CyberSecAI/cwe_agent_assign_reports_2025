  "query": "MyDumper is a MySQL Logical Backup Tool. The MySQL C client library (libmysqlclient) allows authenticated remote actors to read arbitrary files from client systems via a crafted server response to LOAD LOCAL INFILE query, leading to sensitive information disclosure when clients connect to untrusted MySQL servers without explicitly disabling the local infile capability. Mydumper has the local infile option enabled by default and does not have an option to disable it. This can lead to an unexpected arbitrary file read if the Mydumper tool connects to an untrusted server. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.18.2-8.",
