## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Arbitrary Authenticated File Upload Leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE)

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper file type validation in the file upload functionality of the Codeastro Hospital Management System (HMS). The application doesn't verify if the uploaded file is an image or a different file type like a PHP script.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Insecure File Upload:** The system allows users to upload files without proper validation.
*   **Lack of File Type Checks:** The code doesn't verify the file extension or MIME type before saving the file.
*   **Direct Storage in Web Root:** Uploaded files are saved within the web root directory, making them accessible through the web server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Attackers can upload and execute arbitrary PHP code on the server.
*   **System Compromise:** A successful exploit could lead to complete compromise of the server and potentially other connected systems.
*   **Data Breach:** Attackers could potentially access sensitive system information and patient data.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Depending on the attacker's access level, they might be able to escalate privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **File Upload Endpoint:** The vulnerable endpoint is `/his_doc_update-account.php`.
*   **Malicious File Upload:** The attacker uploads a malicious PHP file (e.g., `code.php`) containing executable code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user (e.g., a doctor or employee).
*   **Web Access:** The attacker needs access to the application's web interface.
*   **Ability to Upload Files:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the file upload functionality.

**More Detail than the CVE Description:**
The provided content includes:
*   Specific vulnerable code snippet: The `move_uploaded_file` function is used without proper validation.
*   Detailed Proof of Concept (PoC): It provides step-by-step instructions on how to exploit the vulnerability, including the malicious PHP payload and the request used for file upload.
*   Mitigation advice: It suggests concrete solutions like restricting allowed file types, renaming uploaded files, storing files outside the web root, and using MIME type validation.
*   Example secure code: The document provides an example of how file uploads should be handled to prevent the vulnerability
