Given the description explicitly mentions \"**improper authorization**\", and the guidance suggests using more specific CWEs when possible, CWE-863 was selected as the primary CWE because it represents a more specific form of authorization failure.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe285 -->|ParentOf| cwe863\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe285 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain consists of a single point:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Improper authorization** (CWE-863)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The description clearly states \"**improper authorization**,\" which immediately suggests CWEs related to authorization issues.\n\nThe Retriever Results listed CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) and CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) as potential candidates. The \"Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance\" section provides valuable context for differentiating between authentication and authorization failures. Since the description focuses on authorization, CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) was ruled out.\n\nThe decision to select CWE-863 over CWE-285 was based on the guidance to choose the most specific CWE available. CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) implies that an authorization check is performed, but it's done incorrectly, which aligns with the \"**improper authorization**\" description. CWE-285 is a broader category.\n\nThe final decision is based on the available evidence and the principle of selecting the most specific and relevant CWE. The confidence level is high due to the clear statement of \"**improper authorization**\" in the vulnerability description.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
