This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Tungsten Automation Power PDF. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the handling of Annotation objects. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.

This leads to an out-of-bounds read.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\\n- Out-of-bounds read: The application reads data beyond the allocated buffer due to insufficient validation of user-provided data related to annotation objects.\\n\\n**Impact of exploitation:**\\n- Information disclosure: An attacker can potentially read sensitive information from the application's memory.\\n- Code Execution (potential):  The advisory mentions that this vulnerability can be used in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.\\n\\n**Attack vectors:**\\n- Malicious file: The target user must open a malicious PDF file containing specially crafted annotation objects.\\n- Malicious page:  The target user must visit a malicious page.\\n\\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\\n- The attacker needs to create a malicious PDF file or a webpage with malicious content that includes crafted annotation data.\\n- The attacker needs to convince the target user to open the malicious PDF file or visit the malicious page.\\n- The attacker can be a remote attacker, no specific position required.\\n- User interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability.\", similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {95: {'cwe_counts': defaultdict(<class 'int'>, {'CWE-125': 8}), 'total_samples': 10, 'distribution':

    "enhanced_query": "# Vulnerability Description\n\n    Tungsten Automation Power PDF AcroForm Annotation **Out-Of-Bounds Read** **Information Disclosure Vulnerability**. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Tungsten Automation Power PDF. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the handling of Annotation objects. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-24474.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'lack of proper validation of user-supplied data'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1.
