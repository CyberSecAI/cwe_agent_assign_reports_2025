Here's an extraction of the relevant information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability is due to the execution of the `EVSearcher.bat` file, where the password is passed in plain text on the command line.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **CWE-214:** Invocation of Process Using Visible Sensitive Information - Passing sensitive information (passwords) as command-line arguments.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nExposure of Arctera Enterprise Vault credentials to tools capturing system activity (e.g., Sysmon, Process Monitor) if those tools are installed on the eDiscovery Platform server.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   An attacker with administrator privileges on the eDiscovery Platform Windows server can view system logs (Sysmon or ProcMon) to extract the plaintext password.\n*   The vulnerability only impacts implementations configured to collect from the Arctera Enterprise Vault application.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   Administrator privileges on the eDiscovery Platform Windows server.\n*   Sysmon or Process Monitor (ProcMon) tools must be installed on the server.\n*   The eDiscovery Platform must be configured to collect from Arctera Enterprise Vault.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   Upgrade to Arctera eDiscovery Platform version 10.3.2 or later.  The update is available at: <https://www.veritas.com/support/en_US/downloads/update.UPD235828>\n*   General download center: <https://www.veritas.com/support/en_US/downloads>\n\n**Affected Versions:**\n\nArctera/Veritas eDiscovery Platform versions: 10.3.1, 10.3, 10.2.7, 10.2.6, 10.2.5, 10.2.4, 10.2.3, 10.2.2, 10.2.1, 10.2. Earlier unsupported versions may be affected as well.\n\n**Severity:**\n\nMEDIUM\n\n**CVSS v3.1 Base Score:** 6.0 (AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N)",

The password is passed as a command line argument. |\n| CWE-312 | Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary candidate. The password is being stored in cleartext, but the primary issue is how it is being used. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-214, which has a parent CWE of CWE-497 (Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere). CWE-214 also has a peer relationship with itself, indicating that it can be both the cause and the result in some scenarios. It is a base level CWE. CWE-312 is a child of CWE-311 (Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data), and it has children like CWE-313 (Cleartext Storage in a File or on Disk).

The vulnerability description key phrases call out the **cleartext password on command line** directly. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also indicates the root cause is due to the execution of the `EVSearcher.bat` file, where the password is passed in plain text on the command line. The vulnerability present is CWE-214.\n\nThe retriever results list CWE-214 as the top candidate with a score of 0.155. It is a base level CWE, and the usage is ALLOWED. CWE-312 is also a candidate, but the primary issue is how the password is used. CWE-214 is a better fit.\n\nCWE-311 was considered but not used because it is a class level CWE, and there are more specific children available.\nCWE-319 was considered but not used because the sensitive information is not being transmitted, but rather stored and then used in a command line argument.\nCWE-306 was considered but not used because authentication is present, but the password is exposed on the command line.\nCWE-522 was considered but not used because it is a class level CWE.\n\nCWE-214 is the best fit because it directly addresses the **invocation of process using visible sensitive information**.",
