# Vulnerability Description

    There is an insufficient **input validation vulnerability** in the Warehouse component of Absolute Secure Access prior to 13.06. Attackers with system administrator permissions can impair the availability of certain elements of the Secure Access administrative UI by writing invalid data to the warehouse over the network. There is no loss of warehouse integrity or confidentiality, the security scope is unchanged. Loss of availability is high.
