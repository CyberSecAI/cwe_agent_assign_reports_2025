  "query": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved netfilter ipset fix region locking in hash types Region locking introduced in v5.6-rc4 contained three macros to handle the region locks ahash_bucket_start(), ahash_bucket_end() which gave back the start and end hash bucket values belonging to a given region lock and ahash_region() which should give back the region lock belonging to a given hash bucket. The latter was incorrect which can lead to a race condition between the garbage collector and adding new elements when a hash type of set is defined with timeouts.",
