# Raw Analyzer Response for CVE-2025-30222

# Summary

| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-200 | Information Exposure [CWE-200: Information Exposure] | 0.9 | Class | Allowed | Primary CWE: The vulnerability results in the exposure of environment variables, directly aligning with the characteristics of Information Exposure. |
| CWE-150 | Improper Neutralization of Escape, Meta, or Control Sequences [CWE-150: Improper Neutralization of Escape, Meta, or Control Sequences] | 0.7 | Variant | Allowed | Secondary Candidate: The **incorrect escaping** of the percent character is a form of **improper neutralization** of a special element. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis

The primary relationship is that CWE-150 is a potential cause for CWE-200. The **improper neutralization** can lead to the **exposure of sensitive information**.

## Vulnerability Chain

The vulnerability chain starts with the **improper neutralization** of the percent character (CWE-150), leading to the **exposure of environment variables** (CWE-200).

## Summary of Analysis

The primary weakness is **information exposure** (CWE-200) because the vulnerability allows an attacker to read environment variables. The root cause is the **incorrect escaping** of the percent character, which can be mapped to **improper neutralization** (CWE-150).

The decision to select CWE-200 as the primary weakness is based on the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which lists CWE-200 as a present vulnerability. The vulnerability description also states that the impact is potential environment variable exposure, which directly aligns with the definition of CWE-200.

CWE-150 is included as a secondary candidate because the root cause of the **information exposure** is the **improper handling** of the percent character when escaping shell arguments. The **incorrect escaping** can be considered as a form of **improper neutralization** of a special element (%).

Relevant CWE Information:
# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-150: Improper Neutralization of Escape, Meta, or Control Sequences
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as escape, meta, or control character sequences when they are sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

CWE-79, CWE-93, CWE-116, CWE-117, CWE-138, CWE-156, CWE-178, CWE-184, CWE-212, CWE-497, CWE-498, CWE-499, CWE-863, CWE-88, CWE-942, CWE-1333, and CWE-226 were considered but not used because they did not accurately describe the root cause or impact of the vulnerability. The primary impact is **information exposure**, and the root cause is the **improper escaping** of the percent character, making CWE-200 and CWE-150 the most appropriate mappings.
