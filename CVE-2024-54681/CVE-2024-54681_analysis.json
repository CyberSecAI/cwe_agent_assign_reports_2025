The files are exposed to an attacker with full access. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-552, which is a Base level CWE. CWE-668 is a Class-level CWE and a parent of CWE-552.

An attacker with full access could use these files to compromise the translations. The key phrase is \"**bash files in private directory**\".\n\nCWE-552 (Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties) is the most appropriate CWE because it describes the root cause of the vulnerability: the bash files are accessible to an attacker who already has full access to the mobile platform. This aligns directly with the CWE description, which states that \"The product makes files or directories accessible to unauthorized actors, even though they should not be.\" The **impact** is that the attacker can compromise the translations.\n\nCWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere) is a Class level CWE that is too general. The retriever lists the usage as discouraged.\n\nBased on the evidence, CWE-552 is the optimal level of specificity.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n**CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties**\nThe product makes files or directories accessible to unauthorized actors, even though they should not be.",
