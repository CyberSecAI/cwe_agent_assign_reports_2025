It has a hierarchical relationship with CWE-407 (ChildOf), which is a Class level CWE. Since the description specifically mentions regular expression complexity, CWE-1333 is a more specific and appropriate choice than its parent.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1333[\"CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\"]\n    cwe407[\"CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity\"]\n    \n    cwe1333 -->|CHILDOF| cwe407\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1333 primary\n    class cwe407 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **inefficient regular expression complexity** (CWE-1333). An attacker can manipulate the \"Name\" argument to trigger this inefficiency, leading to excessive CPU consumption. The chain consists of:\n1.  **Root Cause:** CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\n2.  **Impact:** Excessive CPU consumption, potentially leading to denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that the manipulation of the argument \"Name\" leads to **inefficient regular expression complexity**. This aligns perfectly with CWE-1333 (Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity). The retriever results also list CWE-1333 as the top candidate. The evidence is strong and directly supports the selection of CWE-1333 as the primary CWE. The provided evidence is: \"The manipulation of the argument Name leads to **inefficient regular expression complexity**\". The other CWEs were not selected because they did not align as directly with the described root cause. For example, CWE-407 is a more general case of algorithmic complexity, while CWE-1333 is specific to regular expressions, fitting the description more precisely. The selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly addresses the root cause described in the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-178: Improper Handling of Case Sensitivity\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly account for differences in case sensitivity when accessing or determining the properties of a resource, leading to inconsistent results.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
