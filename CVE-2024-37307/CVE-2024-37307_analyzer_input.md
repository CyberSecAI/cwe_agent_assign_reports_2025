# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-37307

## Vulnerability Description
Cilium is a networking, observability, and security solution with an eBPF-based dataplane. Starting in version 1.13.0 and prior to versions 1.13.7, 1.14.12, and 1.15.6, the output of `cilium-bugtool` **can contain sensitive data** when the tool is run (with the `--envoy-dump` flag set) against Cilium deployments with the Envoy proxy enabled. Users of the TLS inspection, Ingress with TLS termination, Gateway API with TLS termination, and Kafka network policies with API key filtering features are affected. The sensitive data includes the CA certificate, certificate chain, and private key used by Cilium HTTP Network Policies, and when using Ingress/Gateway API and the API keys used in Kafka-related network policy. `cilium-bugtool` is a debugging tool that is typically invoked manually and does not run during the normal operation of a Cilium cluster. This issue has been patched in Cilium v1.15.6, v1.14.12, and v1.13.17. There is no workaround to this issue.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **can contain sensitive data**
- **impact:** expose CA certificate, certificate chain, private key; expose API keys
- **vector:** run with --envoy-dump flag
- **product:** Cilium
- **version:** 1.13.0 to 1.13.6, 1.14.0 to 1.14.11, 1.15.0 to 1.15.5
- **component:** cilium-bugtool

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-37307:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `cilium-bugtool`, when used with the `--envoy-dump` flag, was not sanitizing sensitive data present in Envoy's configuration dump.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Sensitive data exposure in the output of `cilium-bugtool`.
- Lack of proper sanitization of configuration data before being included in the bugtool output.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Leakage of TLS private keys, CA certificates, and certificate chains used by Cilium HTTP Network Policies, Ingress/Gateway API.
- Exposure of API keys used in Kafka network policies.
- This information could be used by attackers to impersonate services, decrypt communications, or gain unauthorized access.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access to a system running `cilium-bugtool` with the `--envoy-dump` flag set.
- An attacker would need to execute the `cilium-bugtool` command.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to have high privileges to execute `cilium-bugtool`.
- The attacker needs to be able to execute the tool locally or have access to the output of the tool when executed remotely.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
- The vulnerability affects Cilium versions 1.13.0 to 1.13.16, 1.14.0 to 1.14.11, and 1.15.0 to 1.15.5 inclusive.
- Patched versions are 1.13.17, 1.14.12, and 1.15.6.
- The issue stems from the `cilium-bugtool` not masking sensitive information from Envoy config dumps, including TLS certificates and Kafka API keys.
- The fix includes adding a post-processing masking function that redacts the sensitive fields (`api_key`, `trusted_ca`, `certificate_chain`, `private_key`) from the Envoy config dump.
- The vulnerability is rated as high severity with a CVSS score of 7.9.
- The attack vector is local, with low attack complexity and high privileges required.
