The case is, in [_ux_host_class_pima_read](https://github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/blob/master/common/usbx_host_classes/src/ux_host_class_pima_read.c), there is data length from device response, returned in the very first packet, and read by [L165 code](https://github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/blob/082fd9db09a3669eca3358f10b8837a5c1635c0b/common/usbx_host_classes/src/ux_host_class_pima_read.c#L165), as header_length. Then in [L178 code](https://github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/blob/082fd9db09a3669eca3358f10b8837a5c1635c0b/common/usbx_host_classes/src/ux_host_class_pima_read.c#L178), there is a \u201cif\u201d branch, which check the expression of \u201c(header_length - UX_HOST_CLASS_PIMA_DATA_HEADER_SIZE) > data_length\u201d where if header_length is smaller than UX_HOST_CLASS_PIMA_DATA_HEADER_SIZE, calculation could overflow and then [L182 code](https://github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/blob/082fd9db09a3669eca3358f10b8837a5c1635c0b/common/usbx_host_classes/src/ux_host_class_pima_read.c#L182) the calculation of data_length is also overflow, this way the later [while loop start from L192](https://github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/blob/082fd9db09a3669eca3358f10b8837a5c1635c0b/common/usbx_host_classes/src/ux_host_class_pima_read.c#L192) can move data_pointer to unexpected address and cause write buffer overflow.

NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2020-11736.\n\n- CVE-2021-21272: ORAS is open source software which enables a way to push OCI Artifacts to OCI Conformant registries. ORAS is both a CLI for initial testing and a Go Module. In ORAS from version 0.4.0 and before version 0.9.0, there is a \"zip-slip\" vulnerability. The directory support feature allows the downloaded gzipped tarballs to be automatically extracted to the user-specified directory where the tarball can have symbolic links and hard links. A well-crafted tarball or tarballs allow malicious artifact providers linking, writing, or overwriting specific files on the host filesystem outside of the user-specified directory unexpectedly with the same permissions as the user who runs `oras pull`. Users of the affected versions are impacted if they are `oras` CLI users who runs `oras pull`, or if they are Go programs, which invoke `github.com/deislabs/oras/pkg/content.FileStore`. The problem has been fixed in version 0.9.0. For `oras` CLI users, there is no workarounds other than pulling from a trusted artifact provider. For `oras` package users, the workaround is to not use `github.com/deislabs/oras/pkg/content.FileStore`, and use other content stores instead, or pull from a trusted artifact provider.\n\n- CVE-2021-28650: autoar-extractor.c in GNOME gnome-autoar before 0.3.1, as used by GNOME Shell, Nautilus, and other software, allows Directory Traversal during extraction because it lacks a check of whether a file's parent is a symlink in certain complex situations. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2020-36241.\n\n- CVE-2021-32518: A vulnerability in share_link in QSAN Storage Manager allows remote attackers to create a symbolic link then access arbitrary files. The referred vulnerability has been solved with the updated version of QSAN Storage Manager v3.3.3.\n\n- CVE-2021-32803: The npm package \"tar\" (aka node-tar) before versions 6.1.2, 5.0.7, 4.4.15, and 3.2.3 has an arbitrary File Creation/Overwrite vulnerability via insufficient symlink protection. `node-tar` aims to guarantee that any file whose location would be modified by a symbolic link is not extracted. This is, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary `stat` calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are created. This logic was insufficient when extracting tar files that contained both a directory and a symlink with the same name as the directory. This order of operations resulted in the directory being created and added to the `node-tar` directory cache. When a directory is present in the directory cache, subsequent calls to mkdir for that directory are skipped. However, this is also where `node-tar` checks for symlinks occur. By first creating a directory, and then replacing that directory with a symlink, it was thus possible to bypass `node-tar` symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar file to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary files into that location, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite. This issue was addressed in releases 3.2.3, 4.4.15, 5.0.7 and 6.1.2.\n\n- CVE-2021-32825: bblfshd is an open source self-hosted server for source code parsing. In bblfshd before commit 4265465b9b6fb5663c30ee43806126012066aad4 there is a \"zipslip\" vulnerability. The unsafe handling of symbolic links in an unpacking routine may enable attackers to read and/or write to arbitrary locations outside the designated target folder. This issue may lead to arbitrary file write (with same permissions as the program running the unpack operation) if the attacker can control the archive file. Additionally, if the attacker has read access to the unpacked files, he may be able to read arbitrary system files the parent process has permissions to read. For more details including a PoC see the referenced GHSL-2020-258.\n\n- CVE-2021-36286: Dell SupportAssist Client Consumer versions 3.9.13.0 and any versions prior to 3.9.13.0 contain an arbitrary file deletion vulnerability that can be exploited by using the Windows feature of NTFS called Symbolic links. Symbolic links can be created by any(non-privileged) user under some object directories, but by themselves are not sufficient to successfully escalate privileges. However, combining them with a different object, such as the NTFS junction point allows for the exploitation. Support assist clean files functionality do not distinguish junction points from the physical folder and proceeds to clean the target of the junction that allows nonprivileged users to create junction points and delete arbitrary files on the system which can be accessed only by the admin.\n\n- CVE-2021-38511: An issue was discovered in the tar crate before 0.4.36 for Rust. When symlinks are present in a TAR archive, extraction can create arbitrary directories via .. traversal.\n\n- CVE-2021-29136: Open Container Initiative umoci before 0.4.7 allows attackers to overwrite arbitrary host paths via a crafted image that causes symlink traversal when \"umoci unpack\" or \"umoci raw unpack\" is used.\n\n- CVE-2020-27833: A Zip Slip vulnerability was found in the oc binary in openshift-clients where an arbitrary file write is achieved by using a specially crafted raw container image (.tar file) which contains symbolic links. The vulnerability is limited to the command `oc image extract`. If a symbolic link is first created pointing within the tarball, this allows further symbolic links to bypass the existing path check. This flaw allows the tarball to create links outside the tarball's parent directory, allowing for executables or configuration files to be overwritten, resulting in arbitrary code execution. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability. Versions up to and including openshift-clients-4.7.0-202104250659.p0.git.95881af are affected.\n\n- CVE-2020-27697: Trend Micro Security 2020 (Consumer) contains a vulnerability in the installer package that could be exploited by placing a malicious DLL in a non-protected location with high privileges (symlink attack) which can lead to obtaining administrative privileges during the installation of the product.\n\n- CVE-2020-4717: A vulnerability exists in IBM SPSS Modeler Subscription Installer that allows a user with create symbolic link permission to write arbitrary file in another protected path during product installation.

It affects multi-user setups in which \u2019guix-daemon\u2019 runs locally. The attack consists in having an unprivileged user spawn a build process, for instance with `guix build`, that makes its build directory world-writable. The user then creates a hardlink to a root-owned file such as /etc/shadow in that build directory. If the user passed the --keep-failed option and the build eventually fails, the daemon changes ownership of the whole build tree, including the hardlink, to the user. At that point, the user has write access to the target file. Versions after and including v0.11.0-3298-g2608e40988, and versions prior to v1.2.0-75109-g94f0312546 are vulnerable.\n\n- CVE-2020-28007: Exim 4 before 4.94.2 allows Execution with Unnecessary Privileges.

This vulnerability may potentially allow any local user to access system functionality and configuration information that should only be available to a privileged user. Affects versions 8.0.0.0 through 8.1.3.1 of AVPU.\n\n- CVE-2021-21290: Netty is an open-source, asynchronous event-driven network application framework for rapid development of maintainable high performance protocol servers & clients. In Netty before version 4.1.59.Final there is a vulnerability on Unix-like systems involving an insecure temp file. When netty's multipart decoders are used local information disclosure can occur via the local system temporary directory if temporary storing uploads on the disk is enabled. On unix-like systems, the temporary directory is shared between all user. As such, writing to this directory using APIs that do not explicitly set the file/directory permissions can lead to information disclosure. Of note, this does not impact modern MacOS Operating Systems. The method \"File.createTempFile\" on unix-like systems creates a random file, but, by default will create this file with the permissions \"-rw-r--r--\". Thus, if sensitive information is written to this file, other local users can read this information. This is the case in netty's \"AbstractDiskHttpData\" is vulnerable. This has been fixed in version 4.1.59.Final. As a workaround, one may specify your own \"java.io.tmpdir\" when you start the JVM or use \"DefaultHttpDataFactory.setBaseDir(...)\" to set the directory to something that is only readable by the current user.\n\n- CVE-2022-45935: Usage of temporary files with insecure permissions by the Apache James server allows an attacker with local access to access private user data in transit.

It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The identifier of this vulnerability is VDB-216988.\n\n- CVE-2021-22572: On unix-like systems, the system temporary directory is shared between all users on that system. The root cause is File.createTempFile creates files in the the system temporary directory with world readable permissions. Any sensitive information written to theses files is visible to all other local users on unix-like systems. We recommend upgrading past commit https://github.com/google/data-transfer-project/pull/969\n\n- CVE-2022-24823: Netty is an open-source, asynchronous event-driven network application framework. The package `io.netty:netty-codec-http` prior to version 4.1.77.Final contains an insufficient fix for CVE-2021-21290. When Netty's multipart decoders are used local information disclosure can occur via the local system temporary directory if temporary storing uploads on the disk is enabled. This only impacts applications running on Java version 6 and lower. Additionally, this vulnerability impacts code running on Unix-like systems, and very old versions of Mac OSX and Windows as they all share the system temporary directory between all users. Version 4.1.77.Final contains a patch for this vulnerability. As a workaround, specify one's own `java.io.tmpdir` when starting the JVM or use DefaultHttpDataFactory.setBaseDir(...) to set the directory to something that is only readable by the current user.\n\n- CVE-2022-24411: Dell PowerScale OneFS 8.2.2 and above contain an elevation of privilege vulnerability.

Modules for TCP syslog reception have a potential heap buffer overflow when octet-counted framing is used. This can result in a segfault or some other malfunction. As of our understanding, this vulnerability can not be used for remote code execution. But there may still be a slight chance for experts to do that. The bug occurs when the octet count is read. While there is a check for the maximum number of octets, digits are written to a heap buffer even when the octet count is over the maximum, This can be used to overrun the memory buffer. However, once the sequence of digits stop, no additional characters can be added to the buffer. In our opinion, this makes remote exploits impossible or at least highly complex. Octet-counted framing is one of two potential framing modes. It is relatively uncommon, but enabled by default on receivers. Modules `imtcp`, `imptcp`, `imgssapi`, and `imhttp` are used for regular syslog message reception. It is best practice not to directly expose them to the public. When this practice is followed, the risk is considerably lower. Module `imdiag` is a diagnostics module primarily intended for testbench runs. We do not expect it to be present on any production installation. Octet-counted framing is not very common. Usually, it needs to be specifically enabled at senders. If users do not need it, they can turn it off for the most important modules. This will mitigate the vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2022-25727: Memory Corruption in modem due to improper length check while copying into memory in Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Voice & Music\n\n- CVE-2022-25793: A Stack-based Buffer Overflow Vulnerability in Autodesk 3ds Max 2022, 2021, and 2020 may lead to code execution through the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer when parsing ActionScript Byte Code files.

Azure RTOS USBX implementation of host support for USB CDC ECM includes an integer underflow and a buffer overflow in the `_ux_host_class_cdc_ecm_mac_address_get` function which may be potentially exploited to achieve remote code execution or denial of service. Setting mac address string descriptor length to a `0` or `1` allows an attacker to introduce an integer underflow followed (string_length) by a buffer overflow of the `cdc_ecm -> ux_host_class_cdc_ecm_node_id` array. This may allow one to redirect the code execution flow or introduce a denial of service. The fix has been included in USBX release [6.1.12](https://github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/releases/tag/v6.1.12_rel). Improved mac address string descriptor length validation to check for unexpectedly small values may be used as a workaround.\n\n- CVE-2022-36620: D-link DIR-816 A2_v1.10CNB04, DIR-878 DIR_878_FW1.30B08.img is vulnerable to Buffer Overflow via /goform/addRouting.\n\n- CVE-2022-37134: D-link DIR-816 A2_v1.10CNB04.img is vulnerable to Buffer Overflow via /goform/form2Wan.cgi.

Prior to version 0.10.2, the heap initialization methods were missing a minimum size check for the given heap size argument. This could lead to out-of-bound writes when a heap was initialized with a size smaller than `3 * size_of::<usize>` because of metadata write operations. This vulnerability impacts all the initialization functions on the `Heap` and `LockedHeap` types, including `Heap::new`, `Heap::init`, `Heap::init_from_slice`, and `LockedHeap::new`. It also affects multiple uses of the `Heap::extend` method. Version 0.10.2 contains a patch for the issue. As a workaround, ensure that the heap is only initialized with a size larger than `3 * size_of::<usize>` and that the `Heap::extend` method is only called with sizes larger than `2 * size_of::<usize>()`. Also, ensure that the total heap size is (and stays) a multiple of `2 * size_of::<usize>()`.\n\n- CVE-2022-36938: DexLoader function get_stringidx_fromdex() in Redex prior to commit 3b44c64 can load an out of bound address when loading the string index table, potentially allowing remote code execution during processing of a 3rd party Android APK file.\n\n- CVE-2021-1058: NVIDIA vGPU software contains a vulnerability in the guest kernel mode driver and vGPU plugin, in which an input data size is not validated, which may lead to tampering of data or denial of service.

We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2021-37677: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions the shape inference code for `tf.raw_ops.Dequantize` has a vulnerability that could trigger a denial of service via a segfault if an attacker provides invalid arguments. The shape inference [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/460e000de3a83278fb00b61a16d161b1964f15f4/tensorflow/core/ops/array_ops.cc#L2999-L3014) uses `axis` to select between two different values for `minmax_rank` which is then used to retrieve tensor dimensions. However, code assumes that `axis` can be either `-1` or a value greater than `-1`, with no validation for the other values. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit da857cfa0fde8f79ad0afdbc94e88b5d4bbec764. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2021-39193: Frontier is Substrate's Ethereum compatibility layer. Prior to commit number 0b962f218f0cdd796dadfe26c3f09e68f7861b26, a bug in `pallet-ethereum` can cause invalid transactions to be included in the Ethereum block state in `pallet-ethereum` due to not validating the input data size. Any invalid transactions included this way have no possibility to alter the internal Ethereum or Substrate state. The transaction will appear to have be included, but is of no effect as it is rejected by the EVM engine. The impact is further limited by Substrate extrinsic size constraints. A patch is available in commit number 0b962f218f0cdd796dadfe26c3f09e68f7861b26. There are no workarounds aside from applying the patch.\n\n- CVE-2021-39690: In setDisplayPadding of WallpaperManagerService.java, there is a possible way to cause a persistent DoS due to improper input validation.

This crash affects the availability of the software and dependent downstream components.\n\n- CVE-2022-23580: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. During shape inference, TensorFlow can allocate a large vector based on a value from a tensor controlled by the user. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2022-29202: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, the implementation of `tf.ragged.constant` does not fully validate the input arguments. This results in a denial of service by consuming all available memory. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-36078: Binary provides encoding/decoding in Borsh and other formats. The vulnerability is a memory allocation vulnerability that can be exploited to allocate slices in memory with (arbitrary) excessive size value, which can either exhaust available memory or crash the whole program. When using `github.com/gagliardetto/binary` to parse unchecked (or wrong type of) data from untrusted sources of input (e.g. the blockchain) into slices, it's possible to allocate memory with excessive size. When `dec.Decode(&val)` method is used to parse data into a structure that is or contains slices of values, the length of the slice was previously read directly from the data itself without any checks on the size of it, and then a slice was allocated. This could lead to an overflow and an allocation of memory with excessive size value. Users should upgrade to `v0.7.1` or higher. A workaround is not to rely on the `dec.Decode(&val)` function to parse the data, but to use a custom `UnmarshalWithDecoder()` method that reads and checks the length of any slice.\n\n- CVE-2022-37311: OX App Suite through 7.10.6 has Uncontrolled Resource Consumption via a large location request parameter to the redirect servlet.\n\n- CVE-2022-37312: OX App Suite through 7.10.6 has Uncontrolled Resource Consumption via a large request body containing a redirect URL to the deferrer servlet.\n\n- CVE-2022-39294: conduit-hyper integrates a conduit application with the hyper server. Prior to version 0.4.2, `conduit-hyper` did not check any limit on a request's length before calling [`hyper::body::to_bytes`](https://docs.rs/hyper/latest/hyper/body/fn.to_bytes.html). An attacker could send a malicious request with an abnormally large `Content-Length`, which could lead to a panic if memory allocation failed for that request. In version 0.4.2, `conduit-hyper` sets an internal limit of 128 MiB per request, otherwise returning status 400 (\"Bad Request\"). This crate is part of the implementation of Rust's [crates.io](https://crates.io/), but that service is not affected due to its existing cloud infrastructure, which already drops such malicious requests. Even with the new limit in place, `conduit-hyper` is not recommended for production use, nor to directly serve the public Internet.\n\n- CVE-2022-4111: Unrestricted file size limit can lead to DoS in tooljet/tooljet <1.27 by allowing a logged in attacker to upload profile pictures over 2MB. \n\n- CVE-2022-41968: Nextcloud Server is an open source personal cloud server. Prior to versions 23.0.10 and 24.0.5, calendar name lengths are not validated before writing to a database. As a result, an attacker can send unnecessary amounts of data against the database. Version 23.0.10 and 24.0.5 contain patches for the issue. No known workarounds are available.\n\n- CVE-2022-20488: In NotificationChannel of NotificationChannel.java, there is a possible failure to persist permissions settings due to resource exhaustion. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed.

This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-10 Android-11 Android-12 Android-12L Android-13Android ID: A-242703556\n\n- CVE-2022-20691: A vulnerability in the Cisco Discovery Protocol functionality of Cisco ATA 190 Series Adaptive Telephone Adapter firmware could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a DoS condition of an affected device. This vulnerability is due to missing length validation of certain Cisco Discovery Protocol packet header fields. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted Cisco Discovery Protocol packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to exhaust available memory and cause the service to restart. Cisco has released firmware updates that address this vulnerability. \n\n- CVE-2022-21208: The package node-opcua before 2.74.0 are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) due to a missing limitation on the number of received chunks - per single session or in total for all concurrent sessions. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending an unlimited number of huge chunks (e.g. 2GB each) without sending the Final closing chunk.\n\n- CVE-2022-29212: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, certain TFLite models that were created using TFLite model converter would crash when loaded in the TFLite interpreter. The culprit is that during quantization the scale of values could be greater than 1 but code was always assuming sub-unit scaling. Thus, since code was calling `QuantizeMultiplierSmallerThanOneExp`, the `TFLITE_CHECK_LT` assertion would trigger and abort the process. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-29196: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.Conv3DBackpropFilterV2` does not fully validate the input arguments. This results in a `CHECK`-failure which can be used to trigger a denial of service attack. The code does not validate that the `filter_sizes` argument is a vector. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-29200: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.LSTMBlockCell` does not fully validate the input arguments. This results in a `CHECK`-failure which can be used to trigger a denial of service attack. The code does not validate the ranks of any of the arguments to this API call. This results in `CHECK`-failures when the elements of the tensor are accessed. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-20 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-20 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-789 (CanPrecede)",

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have a valid account on an affected device. The vulnerability exists because the affected software incorrectly runs the SFTP user service at the privilege level of the account that was running when the ConfD built-in Secure Shell (SSH) server for CLI was enabled. If the ConfD built-in SSH server was not enabled, the device is not affected by this vulnerability. An attacker with low-level privileges could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to an affected device and issuing a series of commands at the SFTP interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to elevate privileges to the level of the account under which ConfD is running, which is commonly root. Note: Any user who can authenticate to the built-in SSH server may exploit this vulnerability. By default, all ConfD users have this access if the server is enabled.

These inconsistencies are particularly pronounced if you are transitioning from one non-root user to another.

These inconsistencies are particularly pronounced if you are transitioning from one non-root user to another. Signal handlers and spawned processes run at the privilege of the owning process, so if a process is running as root when a signal fires or a sub-process is executed, the signal handler or sub-process will operate with root privileges.\n",

The case is, in [_ux_host_class_pima_read](https://github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/blob/master/common/usbx_host_classes/src/ux_host_class_pima_read.c), there is data length from device response, returned in the very first packet, and read by [L165 code](https://github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/blob/082fd9db09a3669eca3358f10b8837a5c1635c0b/common/usbx_host_classes/src/ux_host_class_pima_read.c#L165), as header_length. Then in [L178 code](https://github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/blob/082fd9db09a3669eca3358f10b8837a5c1635c0b/common/usbx_host_classes/src/ux_host_class_pima_read.c#L178), there is a \u201cif\u201d branch, which check the expression of \u201c(header_length - UX_HOST_CLASS_PIMA_DATA_HEADER_SIZE) > data_length\u201d where if header_length is smaller than UX_HOST_CLASS_PIMA_DATA_HEADER_SIZE, calculation could overflow and then [L182 code](https://github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/blob/082fd9db09a3669eca3358f10b8837a5c1635c0b/common/usbx_host_classes/src/ux_host_class_pima_read.c#L182) the calculation of data_length is also overflow, this way the later [while loop start from L192](https://github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/blob/082fd9db09a3669eca3358f10b8837a5c1635c0b/common/usbx_host_classes/src/ux_host_class_pima_read.c#L192) can move data_pointer to unexpected address and cause write buffer overflow. The fix has been included in USBX release [6.1.12](https://github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/releases/tag/v6.1.12_rel). The following can be used as a workaround: Add check of `header_length`: 1. It must be greater than `UX_HOST_CLASS_PIMA_DATA_HEADER_SIZE`. 1. It should be greater or equal to the current returned data length (`transfer_request -> ux_transfer_request_actual_length`).\n\n- CVE-2022-4338: An integer underflow in Organization Specific TLV was found in various versions of OpenvSwitch.\n\n- CVE-2021-31956: Windows NTFS Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2022-22715: Named Pipe File System Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-682 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-682 (ChildOf)",

NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2020-11736.\n\n- CVE-2021-21272: ORAS is open source software which enables a way to push OCI Artifacts to OCI Conformant registries. ORAS is both a CLI for initial testing and a Go Module. In ORAS from version 0.4.0 and before version 0.9.0, there is a \"zip-slip\" vulnerability. The directory support feature allows the downloaded gzipped tarballs to be automatically extracted to the user-specified directory where the tarball can have symbolic links and hard links. A well-crafted tarball or tarballs allow malicious artifact providers linking, writing, or overwriting specific files on the host filesystem outside of the user-specified directory unexpectedly with the same permissions as the user who runs `oras pull`. Users of the affected versions are impacted if they are `oras` CLI users who runs `oras pull`, or if they are Go programs, which invoke `github.com/deislabs/oras/pkg/content.FileStore`. The problem has been fixed in version 0.9.0. For `oras` CLI users, there is no workarounds other than pulling from a trusted artifact provider. For `oras` package users, the workaround is to not use `github.com/deislabs/oras/pkg/content.FileStore`, and use other content stores instead, or pull from a trusted artifact provider.\n\n- CVE-2021-28650: autoar-extractor.c in GNOME gnome-autoar before 0.3.1, as used by GNOME Shell, Nautilus, and other software, allows Directory Traversal during extraction because it lacks a check of whether a file's parent is a symlink in certain complex situations. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2020-36241.\n\n- CVE-2021-32518: A vulnerability in share_link in QSAN Storage Manager allows remote attackers to create a symbolic link then access arbitrary files. The referred vulnerability has been solved with the updated version of QSAN Storage Manager v3.3.3.\n\n- CVE-2021-32803: The npm package \"tar\" (aka node-tar) before versions 6.1.2, 5.0.7, 4.4.15, and 3.2.3 has an arbitrary File Creation/Overwrite vulnerability via insufficient symlink protection. `node-tar` aims to guarantee that any file whose location would be modified by a symbolic link is not extracted. This is, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary `stat` calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are created. This logic was insufficient when extracting tar files that contained both a directory and a symlink with the same name as the directory. This order of operations resulted in the directory being created and added to the `node-tar` directory cache. When a directory is present in the directory cache, subsequent calls to mkdir for that directory are skipped. However, this is also where `node-tar` checks for symlinks occur. By first creating a directory, and then replacing that directory with a symlink, it was thus possible to bypass `node-tar` symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar file to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary files into that location, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite. This issue was addressed in releases 3.2.3, 4.4.15, 5.0.7 and 6.1.2.\n\n- CVE-2021-32825: bblfshd is an open source self-hosted server for source code parsing. In bblfshd before commit 4265465b9b6fb5663c30ee43806126012066aad4 there is a \"zipslip\" vulnerability. The unsafe handling of symbolic links in an unpacking routine may enable attackers to read and/or write to arbitrary locations outside the designated target folder. This issue may lead to arbitrary file write (with same permissions as the program running the unpack operation) if the attacker can control the archive file. Additionally, if the attacker has read access to the unpacked files, he may be able to read arbitrary system files the parent process has permissions to read. For more details including a PoC see the referenced GHSL-2020-258.\n\n- CVE-2021-36286: Dell SupportAssist Client Consumer versions 3.9.13.0 and any versions prior to 3.9.13.0 contain an arbitrary file deletion vulnerability that can be exploited by using the Windows feature of NTFS called Symbolic links. Symbolic links can be created by any(non-privileged) user under some object directories, but by themselves are not sufficient to successfully escalate privileges. However, combining them with a different object, such as the NTFS junction point allows for the exploitation. Support assist clean files functionality do not distinguish junction points from the physical folder and proceeds to clean the target of the junction that allows nonprivileged users to create junction points and delete arbitrary files on the system which can be accessed only by the admin.\n\n- CVE-2021-38511: An issue was discovered in the tar crate before 0.4.36 for Rust. When symlinks are present in a TAR archive, extraction can create arbitrary directories via .. traversal.\n\n- CVE-2021-29136: Open Container Initiative umoci before 0.4.7 allows attackers to overwrite arbitrary host paths via a crafted image that causes symlink traversal when \"umoci unpack\" or \"umoci raw unpack\" is used.\n\n- CVE-2020-27833: A Zip Slip vulnerability was found in the oc binary in openshift-clients where an arbitrary file write is achieved by using a specially crafted raw container image (.tar file) which contains symbolic links. The vulnerability is limited to the command `oc image extract`. If a symbolic link is first created pointing within the tarball, this allows further symbolic links to bypass the existing path check. This flaw allows the tarball to create links outside the tarball's parent directory, allowing for executables or configuration files to be overwritten, resulting in arbitrary code execution. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability. Versions up to and including openshift-clients-4.7.0-202104250659.p0.git.95881af are affected.\n\n- CVE-2020-27697: Trend Micro Security 2020 (Consumer) contains a vulnerability in the installer package that could be exploited by placing a malicious DLL in a non-protected location with high privileges (symlink attack) which can lead to obtaining administrative privileges during the installation of the product.\n\n- CVE-2020-4717: A vulnerability exists in IBM SPSS Modeler Subscription Installer that allows a user with create symbolic link permission to write arbitrary file in another protected path during product installation. IBM X-Force ID: 187727.\n\n- CVE-2021-23239: The sudoedit personality of Sudo before 1.9.5 may allow a local unprivileged user to perform arbitrary directory-existence tests by winning a sudo_edit.c race condition in replacing a user-controlled directory by a symlink to an arbitrary path.\n\n- CVE-2021-32508: Absolute Path Traversal vulnerability in FileStreaming in QSAN Storage Manager allows remote authenticated attackers access arbitrary files by injecting the Symbolic Link following the Url path parameter. The referred vulnerability has been solved with the updated version of QSAN Storage Manager v3.3.3.\n\n- CVE-2021-32509: Absolute Path Traversal vulnerability in FileviewDoc in QSAN Storage Manager allows remote authenticated attackers access arbitrary files by injecting the Symbolic Link following the Url path parameter.

It affects multi-user setups in which \u2019guix-daemon\u2019 runs locally. The attack consists in having an unprivileged user spawn a build process, for instance with `guix build`, that makes its build directory world-writable. The user then creates a hardlink to a root-owned file such as /etc/shadow in that build directory. If the user passed the --keep-failed option and the build eventually fails, the daemon changes ownership of the whole build tree, including the hardlink, to the user. At that point, the user has write access to the target file. Versions after and including v0.11.0-3298-g2608e40988, and versions prior to v1.2.0-75109-g94f0312546 are vulnerable.\n\n- CVE-2020-28007: Exim 4 before 4.94.2 allows Execution with Unnecessary Privileges.

This vulnerability may potentially allow any local user to access system functionality and configuration information that should only be available to a privileged user. Affects versions 8.0.0.0 through 8.1.3.1 of AVPU.\n\n- CVE-2021-21290: Netty is an open-source, asynchronous event-driven network application framework for rapid development of maintainable high performance protocol servers & clients. In Netty before version 4.1.59.Final there is a vulnerability on Unix-like systems involving an insecure temp file. When netty's multipart decoders are used local information disclosure can occur via the local system temporary directory if temporary storing uploads on the disk is enabled. On unix-like systems, the temporary directory is shared between all user. As such, writing to this directory using APIs that do not explicitly set the file/directory permissions can lead to information disclosure. Of note, this does not impact modern MacOS Operating Systems. The method \"File.createTempFile\" on unix-like systems creates a random file, but, by default will create this file with the permissions \"-rw-r--r--\". Thus, if sensitive information is written to this file, other local users can read this information. This is the case in netty's \"AbstractDiskHttpData\" is vulnerable. This has been fixed in version 4.1.59.Final. As a workaround, one may specify your own \"java.io.tmpdir\" when you start the JVM or use \"DefaultHttpDataFactory.setBaseDir(...)\" to set the directory to something that is only readable by the current user.\n\n- CVE-2022-45935: Usage of temporary files with insecure permissions by the Apache James server allows an attacker with local access to access private user data in transit. Vulnerable components includes the SMTP stack and IMAP APPEND command. This issue affects Apache James server version 3.7.2 and prior versions.\n\n- CVE-2022-4817: A vulnerability was found in centic9 jgit-cookbook. It has been declared as problematic. This vulnerability affects unknown code. The manipulation leads to insecure temporary file. The attack can be initiated remotely. The name of the patch is b8cb29b43dc704708d598c60ac1881db7cf8e9c3. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The identifier of this vulnerability is VDB-216988.\n\n- CVE-2021-22572: On unix-like systems, the system temporary directory is shared between all users on that system. The root cause is File.createTempFile creates files in the the system temporary directory with world readable permissions. Any sensitive information written to theses files is visible to all other local users on unix-like systems. We recommend upgrading past commit https://github.com/google/data-transfer-project/pull/969\n\n- CVE-2022-24823: Netty is an open-source, asynchronous event-driven network application framework. The package `io.netty:netty-codec-http` prior to version 4.1.77.Final contains an insufficient fix for CVE-2021-21290. When Netty's multipart decoders are used local information disclosure can occur via the local system temporary directory if temporary storing uploads on the disk is enabled. This only impacts applications running on Java version 6 and lower. Additionally, this vulnerability impacts code running on Unix-like systems, and very old versions of Mac OSX and Windows as they all share the system temporary directory between all users. Version 4.1.77.Final contains a patch for this vulnerability. As a workaround, specify one's own `java.io.tmpdir` when starting the JVM or use DefaultHttpDataFactory.setBaseDir(...) to set the directory to something that is only readable by the current user.\n\n- CVE-2022-24411: Dell PowerScale OneFS 8.2.2 and above contain an elevation of privilege vulnerability. A local attacker with ISI_PRIV_LOGIN_SSH and/or ISI_PRIV_LOGIN_CONSOLE could potentially exploit this vulnerability, leading to elevation of privilege.

In Syncthing before version 1.15.0, the relay server `strelaysrv` can be caused to crash and exit by sending a relay message with a negative length field. Similarly, Syncthing itself can crash for the same reason if given a malformed message from a malicious relay server when attempting to join the relay. Relay joins are essentially random (from a subset of low latency relays) and Syncthing will by default restart when crashing, at which point it's likely to pick another non-malicious relay.

Modules for TCP syslog reception have a potential heap buffer overflow when octet-counted framing is used. This can result in a segfault or some other malfunction. As of our understanding, this vulnerability can not be used for remote code execution. But there may still be a slight chance for experts to do that. The bug occurs when the octet count is read. While there is a check for the maximum number of octets, digits are written to a heap buffer even when the octet count is over the maximum, This can be used to overrun the memory buffer. However, once the sequence of digits stop, no additional characters can be added to the buffer. In our opinion, this makes remote exploits impossible or at least highly complex. Octet-counted framing is one of two potential framing modes. It is relatively uncommon, but enabled by default on receivers. Modules `imtcp`, `imptcp`, `imgssapi`, and `imhttp` are used for regular syslog message reception. It is best practice not to directly expose them to the public. When this practice is followed, the risk is considerably lower. Module `imdiag` is a diagnostics module primarily intended for testbench runs. We do not expect it to be present on any production installation. Octet-counted framing is not very common. Usually, it needs to be specifically enabled at senders. If users do not need it, they can turn it off for the most important modules. This will mitigate the vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2022-25727: Memory Corruption in modem due to improper length check while copying into memory in Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Voice & Music\n\n- CVE-2022-25793: A Stack-based Buffer Overflow Vulnerability in Autodesk 3ds Max 2022, 2021, and 2020 may lead to code execution through the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer when parsing ActionScript Byte Code files.

Azure RTOS USBX implementation of host support for USB CDC ECM includes an integer underflow and a buffer overflow in the `_ux_host_class_cdc_ecm_mac_address_get` function which may be potentially exploited to achieve remote code execution or denial of service. Setting mac address string descriptor length to a `0` or `1` allows an attacker to introduce an integer underflow followed (string_length) by a buffer overflow of the `cdc_ecm -> ux_host_class_cdc_ecm_node_id` array. This may allow one to redirect the code execution flow or introduce a denial of service. The fix has been included in USBX release [6.1.12](https://github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/releases/tag/v6.1.12_rel). Improved mac address string descriptor length validation to check for unexpectedly small values may be used as a workaround.\n\n- CVE-2022-36620: D-link DIR-816 A2_v1.10CNB04, DIR-878 DIR_878_FW1.30B08.img is vulnerable to Buffer Overflow via /goform/addRouting.\n\n- CVE-2022-37134: D-link DIR-816 A2_v1.10CNB04.img is vulnerable to Buffer Overflow via /goform/form2Wan.cgi.

Prior to version 0.10.2, the heap initialization methods were missing a minimum size check for the given heap size argument. This could lead to out-of-bound writes when a heap was initialized with a size smaller than `3 * size_of::<usize>` because of metadata write operations. This vulnerability impacts all the initialization functions on the `Heap` and `LockedHeap` types, including `Heap::new`, `Heap::init`, `Heap::init_from_slice`, and `LockedHeap::new`. It also affects multiple uses of the `Heap::extend` method. Version 0.10.2 contains a patch for the issue. As a workaround, ensure that the heap is only initialized with a size larger than `3 * size_of::<usize>` and that the `Heap::extend` method is only called with sizes larger than `2 * size_of::<usize>()`. Also, ensure that the total heap size is (and stays) a multiple of `2 * size_of::<usize>()`.\n\n- CVE-2022-36938: DexLoader function get_stringidx_fromdex() in Redex prior to commit 3b44c64 can load an out of bound address when loading the string index table, potentially allowing remote code execution during processing of a 3rd party Android APK file.\n\n- CVE-2021-1058: NVIDIA vGPU software contains a vulnerability in the guest kernel mode driver and vGPU plugin, in which an input data size is not validated, which may lead to tampering of data or denial of service.

Prior to commit number 0b962f218f0cdd796dadfe26c3f09e68f7861b26, a bug in `pallet-ethereum` can cause invalid transactions to be included in the Ethereum block state in `pallet-ethereum` due to not validating the input data size. Any invalid transactions included this way have no possibility to alter the internal Ethereum or Substrate state. The transaction will appear to have be included, but is of no effect as it is rejected by the EVM engine. The impact is further limited by Substrate extrinsic size constraints. A patch is available in commit number 0b962f218f0cdd796dadfe26c3f09e68f7861b26. There are no workarounds aside from applying the patch.\n\n- CVE-2021-39690: In setDisplayPadding of WallpaperManagerService.java, there is a possible way to cause a persistent DoS due to improper input validation.

This crash affects the availability of the software and dependent downstream components.\n\n- CVE-2022-23580: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. During shape inference, TensorFlow can allocate a large vector based on a value from a tensor controlled by the user. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2022-29202: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, the implementation of `tf.ragged.constant` does not fully validate the input arguments. This results in a denial of service by consuming all available memory. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-36078: Binary provides encoding/decoding in Borsh and other formats. The vulnerability is a memory allocation vulnerability that can be exploited to allocate slices in memory with (arbitrary) excessive size value, which can either exhaust available memory or crash the whole program. When using `github.com/gagliardetto/binary` to parse unchecked (or wrong type of) data from untrusted sources of input (e.g. the blockchain) into slices, it's possible to allocate memory with excessive size. When `dec.Decode(&val)` method is used to parse data into a structure that is or contains slices of values, the length of the slice was previously read directly from the data itself without any checks on the size of it, and then a slice was allocated. This could lead to an overflow and an allocation of memory with excessive size value. Users should upgrade to `v0.7.1` or higher. A workaround is not to rely on the `dec.Decode(&val)` function to parse the data, but to use a custom `UnmarshalWithDecoder()` method that reads and checks the length of any slice.\n\n- CVE-2022-37311: OX App Suite through 7.10.6 has Uncontrolled Resource Consumption via a large location request parameter to the redirect servlet.\n\n- CVE-2022-37312: OX App Suite through 7.10.6 has Uncontrolled Resource Consumption via a large request body containing a redirect URL to the deferrer servlet.\n\n- CVE-2022-39294: conduit-hyper integrates a conduit application with the hyper server. Prior to version 0.4.2, `conduit-hyper` did not check any limit on a request's length before calling [`hyper::body::to_bytes`](https://docs.rs/hyper/latest/hyper/body/fn.to_bytes.html). An attacker could send a malicious request with an abnormally large `Content-Length`, which could lead to a panic if memory allocation failed for that request. In version 0.4.2, `conduit-hyper` sets an internal limit of 128 MiB per request, otherwise returning status 400 (\"Bad Request\"). This crate is part of the implementation of Rust's [crates.io](https://crates.io/), but that service is not affected due to its existing cloud infrastructure, which already drops such malicious requests. Even with the new limit in place, `conduit-hyper` is not recommended for production use, nor to directly serve the public Internet.\n\n- CVE-2022-4111: Unrestricted file size limit can lead to DoS in tooljet/tooljet <1.27 by allowing a logged in attacker to upload profile pictures over 2MB. \n\n- CVE-2022-41968: Nextcloud Server is an open source personal cloud server. Prior to versions 23.0.10 and 24.0.5, calendar name lengths are not validated before writing to a database. As a result, an attacker can send unnecessary amounts of data against the database. Version 23.0.10 and 24.0.5 contain patches for the issue. No known workarounds are available.\n\n- CVE-2022-20488: In NotificationChannel of NotificationChannel.java, there is a possible failure to persist permissions settings due to resource exhaustion. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-10 Android-11 Android-12 Android-12L Android-13Android ID: A-242703217\n\n- CVE-2022-20491: In NotificationChannel of NotificationChannel.java, there is a possible failure to persist permissions settings due to resource exhaustion. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-10 Android-11 Android-12 Android-12L Android-13Android ID: A-242703556\n\n- CVE-2022-20691: A vulnerability in the Cisco Discovery Protocol functionality of Cisco ATA 190 Series Adaptive Telephone Adapter firmware could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a DoS condition of an affected device. This vulnerability is due to missing length validation of certain Cisco Discovery Protocol packet header fields. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted Cisco Discovery Protocol packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to exhaust available memory and cause the service to restart. Cisco has released firmware updates that address this vulnerability. \n\n- CVE-2022-21208: The package node-opcua before 2.74.0 are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) due to a missing limitation on the number of received chunks - per single session or in total for all concurrent sessions. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending an unlimited number of huge chunks (e.g. 2GB each) without sending the Final closing chunk.\n\n- CVE-2022-29212: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, certain TFLite models that were created using TFLite model converter would crash when loaded in the TFLite interpreter. The culprit is that during quantization the scale of values could be greater than 1 but code was always assuming sub-unit scaling. Thus, since code was calling `QuantizeMultiplierSmallerThanOneExp`, the `TFLITE_CHECK_LT` assertion would trigger and abort the process. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-29196: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.Conv3DBackpropFilterV2` does not fully validate the input arguments. This results in a `CHECK`-failure which can be used to trigger a denial of service attack. The code does not validate that the `filter_sizes` argument is a vector. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-29200: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.LSTMBlockCell` does not fully validate the input arguments. This results in a `CHECK`-failure which can be used to trigger a denial of service attack. The code does not validate the ranks of any of the arguments to this API call. This results in `CHECK`-failures when the elements of the tensor are accessed. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-20 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-20 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-789 (CanPrecede)",

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have a valid account on an affected device. The vulnerability exists because the affected software incorrectly runs the SFTP user service at the privilege level of the account that was running when the ConfD built-in Secure Shell (SSH) server for CLI was enabled. If the ConfD built-in SSH server was not enabled, the device is not affected by this vulnerability. An attacker with low-level privileges could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to an affected device and issuing a series of commands at the SFTP interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to elevate privileges to the level of the account under which ConfD is running, which is commonly root. Note: Any user who can authenticate to the built-in SSH server may exploit this vulnerability. By default, all ConfD users have this access if the server is enabled.

However, there are cases of bad subtraction in which unsigned integers are involved, so it's not always a signedness issue.\n\n\n\"Integer underflow\" is occasionally used to describe array index errors in which the index is negative.\n\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-682\nChildOf -> CWE-682\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2004-0816:** Integer underflow in firewall via malformed packet.\n- **CVE-2004-1002:** Integer underflow by packet with invalid length.\n- **CVE-2005-0199:** Long input causes incorrect length calculation.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\ninsecure temporary file: Some people use the phrase \"insecure temporary file\" when referring to a link following weakness, but other weaknesses can produce insecure temporary files without any symlink involvement at all.\nZip Slip: \"Zip slip\" is an attack that uses file archives (e.g., ZIP, tar, rar, etc.) that contain filenames with path traversal sequences that cause the files to be written outside of the directory under which the archive is expected to be extracted [REF-1282]. It is most commonly used for relative path traversal (CWE-23) and link following (CWE-59).\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-706\nChildOf -> CWE-706\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Theoretical]** \n\nLink following vulnerabilities are Multi-factor Vulnerabilities (MFV). They are the combination of multiple elements: file or directory permissions, filename predictability, race conditions, and in some cases, a design limitation in which there is no mechanism for performing atomic file creation operations.\n\n\nSome potential factors are race conditions, permissions, and predictability.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-1999-1386:** Some versions of Perl follow symbolic links when running with the -e option, which allows local users to overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack.\n- **CVE-2000-1178:** Text editor follows symbolic links when creating a rescue copy during an abnormal exit, which allows local users to overwrite the files of other users.\n- **CVE-2004-0217:** Antivirus update allows local users to create or append to arbitrary files via a symlink attack on a logfile.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-127: Buffer Under-read\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations prior to the targeted buffer.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis typically occurs when the pointer or its index is decremented to a position before the buffer, when pointer arithmetic results in a position before the beginning of the valid memory location, or when a negative index is used. This may result in exposure of sensitive information or possibly a crash.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-125\nChildOf -> CWE-786\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Research Gap]** Under-studied.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-40985:** HTML conversion package has a buffer under-read, allowing a crash\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-378: Creation of Temporary File With Insecure Permissions\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nOpening temporary files without appropriate measures or controls can leave the file, its contents and any function that it impacts vulnerable to attack.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-377\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-24823:** A network application framework uses the Java function createTempFile(), which will create a file that is readable by other local users of the system\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-1313: Hardware Allows Activation of Test or Debug Logic at Runtime\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nDuring runtime, the hardware allows for test or debug logic (feature) to be activated, which allows for changing the state of the hardware. This feature can alter the intended behavior of the system and allow for alteration and leakage of sensitive data by an adversary.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nAn adversary can take advantage of test or debug logic that is made accessible through the hardware during normal operation to modify the intended behavior of the system. For example, an accessible Test/debug mode may allow read/write access to any system data. Using error injection (a common test/debug feature) during a transmit/receive operation on a bus, data may be modified to produce an unintended message. Similarly, confidentiality could be compromised by such features allowing access to secrets.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-33150:** Hardware processor allows activation of test or debug logic at runtime.\n- **CVE-2021-0146:** Processor allows the activation of test or debug logic at runtime, allowing escalation of privileges\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-250: Execution with Unnecessary Privileges\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product performs an operation at a privilege level that is higher than the minimum level required, which creates new weaknesses or amplifies the consequences of other weaknesses.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nNew weaknesses can be exposed because running with extra privileges, such as root or Administrator, can disable the normal security checks being performed by the operating system or surrounding environment. Other pre-existing weaknesses can turn into security vulnerabilities if they occur while operating at raised privileges.\n\n\nPrivilege management functions can behave in some less-than-obvious ways, and they have different quirks on different platforms. These inconsistencies are particularly pronounced if you are transitioning from one non-root user to another. Signal handlers and spawned processes run at the privilege of the owning process, so if a process is running as root when a signal fires or a sub-process is executed, the signal handler or sub-process will operate with root privileges.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-269\nChildOf -> CWE-657\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** There is a close association with CWE-653 (Insufficient Separation of Privileges). CWE-653 is about providing separate components for each privilege; CWE-250 is about ensuring that each component has the least amount of privileges possible.\n\n**[Maintenance]** CWE-271, CWE-272, and CWE-250 are all closely related and possibly overlapping. CWE-271 is probably better suited as a category. Both CWE-272 and CWE-250 are in active use by the community. The \"least privilege\" phrase has multiple interpretations.\n\n**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the \"Mapping CWE to 62443\" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2007-4217:** FTP client program on a certain OS runs with setuid privileges and has a buffer overflow. Most clients do not need extra privileges, so an overflow is not a vulnerability for those clients.\n- **CVE-2008-1877:** Program runs with privileges and calls another program with the same privileges, which allows read of arbitrary files.\n- **CVE-2007-5159:** OS incorrectly installs a program with setuid privileges, allowing users to gain privileges.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-363: Race Condition Enabling Link Following\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product checks the status of a file or directory before accessing it, which produces a race condition in which the file can be replaced with a link before the access is performed, causing the product to access the wrong file.\n\n### Extended Description\nWhile developers might expect that there is a very narrow time window between the time of check and time of use, there is still a race condition. An attacker could cause the product to slow down (e.g. with memory consumption), causing the time window to become larger. Alternately, in some situations, the attacker could win the race by performing a large number of attacks.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-367\nCanPrecede -> CWE-59\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This is already covered by the \"Link Following\" weakness (CWE-59). It is included here because so many people associate race conditions with link problems; however, not all link following issues involve race conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nSpecified quantities include size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, and others. Code may rely on specified quantities to allocate resources, perform calculations, control iteration, etc. When the quantity is not properly validated, then attackers can specify malicious quantities to cause excessive resource allocation, trigger unexpected failures, enable buffer overflows, etc.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-20\nChildOf -> CWE-20\nCanPrecede -> CWE-789\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** This entry is still under development and will continue to see updates and content improvements.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).\n- **CVE-2008-1440:** lack of validation of length field leads to infinite loop\n- **CVE-2008-2374:** lack of validation of string length fields allows memory consumption or buffer over-read\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-912: Hidden Functionality\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product contains functionality that is not documented, not part of the specification, and not accessible through an interface or command sequence that is obvious to the product's users or administrators.\n\n### Extended Description\nHidden functionality can take many forms, such as intentionally malicious code, \"Easter Eggs\" that contain extraneous functionality such as games, developer-friendly shortcuts that reduce maintenance or support costs such as hard-coded accounts, etc. From a security perspective, even when the functionality is not intentionally malicious or damaging, it can increase the product's attack surface and expose additional weaknesses beyond what is already exposed by the intended functionality. Even if it is not easily accessible, the hidden functionality could be useful for attacks that modify the control flow of the application.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-684\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-31260:** Chain: a digital asset management program has an undisclosed backdoor in the legacy version of a PHP script (CWE-912) that could allow an unauthenticated user to export metadata (CWE-306)\n- **CVE-2022-3203:** A wireless access point manual specifies that the only method of configuration is via web interface (CWE-1059), but there is an undisclosed telnet server that was activated by default (CWE-912).\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-269\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-286\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-1999-1193:** untrusted user placed in unix \"wheel\" group\n- **CVE-2005-2741:** Product allows users to grant themselves certain rights that can be used to escalate privileges.\n- **CVE-2005-2496:** Product uses group ID of a user instead of the group, causing it to run with different privileges.

There is an integer underflow and out-of-bounds write during the loading of a bgzip block.\n\n- CVE-2021-28362: An issue was discovered in Contiki through 3.0. When sending an ICMPv6 error message because of invalid extension header options in an incoming IPv6 packet, there is an attempt to remove the RPL extension headers. Because the packet length and the extension header length are unchecked (with respect to the available data) at this stage, and these variables are susceptible to integer underflow, it is possible to construct an invalid extension header that will cause memory corruption issues and lead to a Denial-of-Service condition. This is related to rpl-ext-header.c.\n\n- CVE-2021-3321: Integer Underflow in Zephyr in IEEE 802154 Fragment Reassembly Header Removal. Zephyr versions >= >=2.4.0 contain Integer Overflow to Buffer Overflow (CWE-680). For more information, see https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/security/advisories/GHSA-w44j-66g7-xw99\n\n- CVE-2021-31178: Microsoft Office Information Disclosure Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-4066: Integer underflow in ANGLE in Google Chrome prior to 96.0.4664.93 allowed a remote attacker to potentially exploit heap corruption via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2022-0185: A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the legacy_parse_param function in the Filesystem Context functionality of the Linux kernel verified the supplied parameters length. An unprivileged (in case of unprivileged user namespaces enabled, otherwise needs namespaced CAP_SYS_ADMIN privilege) local user able to open a filesystem that does not support the Filesystem Context API (and thus fallbacks to legacy handling) could use this flaw to escalate their privileges on the system.\n\n- CVE-2022-0544: An integer underflow in the DDS loader of Blender leads to an out-of-bounds read, possibly allowing an attacker to read sensitive data using a crafted DDS image file. This flaw affects Blender versions prior to 2.83.19, 2.93.8 and 3.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-20073: In preloader (usb), there is a possible out of bounds write due to a integer underflow. This could lead to local escalation of privilege, for an attacker who has physical access to the device, with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is needed for exploitation. Patch ID: ALPS06160841; Issue ID: ALPS06160841.\n\n- CVE-2022-20393: In extract3GPPGlobalDescriptions of TextDescriptions.cpp, there is a possible out of bounds read due to an integer overflow. This could lead to local information disclosure from the media server with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-11 Android-12 Android-12LAndroid ID: A-233735886\n\n- CVE-2022-20483: In several functions that parse avrc response in avrc_pars_ct.cc and related files, there are possible out of bounds reads due to integer overflows. This could lead to remote information disclosure with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-10 Android-11 Android-12 Android-12L Android-13Android ID: A-242459126\n\n- CVE-2022-20516: In rw_t3t_act_handle_check_ndef_rsp of rw_t3t.cc, there is a possible out of bounds read due to an integer overflow. This could lead to remote information disclosure with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-13Android ID: A-224002331\n\n- CVE-2022-23613: xrdp is an open source remote desktop protocol (RDP) server. In affected versions an integer underflow leading to a heap overflow in the sesman server allows any unauthenticated attacker which is able to locally access a sesman server to execute code as root. This vulnerability has been patched in version 0.9.18.1 and above. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-39293: Azure RTOS USBX is a high-performance USB host, device, and on-the-go (OTG) embedded stack, that is fully integrated with Azure RTOS ThreadX. The case is, in [_ux_host_class_pima_read](https://github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/blob/master/common/usbx_host_classes/src/ux_host_class_pima_read.c), there is data length from device response, returned in the very first packet, and read by [L165 code](https://github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/blob/082fd9db09a3669eca3358f10b8837a5c1635c0b/common/usbx_host_classes/src/ux_host_class_pima_read.c#L165), as header_length. Then in [L178 code](https://github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/blob/082fd9db09a3669eca3358f10b8837a5c1635c0b/common/usbx_host_classes/src/ux_host_class_pima_read.c#L178), there is a \u201cif\u201d branch, which check the expression of \u201c(header_length - UX_HOST_CLASS_PIMA_DATA_HEADER_SIZE) > data_length\u201d where if header_length is smaller than UX_HOST_CLASS_PIMA_DATA_HEADER_SIZE, calculation could overflow and then [L182 code](https://github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/blob/082fd9db09a3669eca3358f10b8837a5c1635c0b/common/usbx_host_classes/src/ux_host_class_pima_read.c#L182) the calculation of data_length is also overflow, this way the later [while loop start from L192](https://github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/blob/082fd9db09a3669eca3358f10b8837a5c1635c0b/common/usbx_host_classes/src/ux_host_class_pima_read.c#L192) can move data_pointer to unexpected address and cause write buffer overflow. The fix has been included in USBX release [6.1.12](https://github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/releases/tag/v6.1.12_rel). The following can be used as a workaround: Add check of `header_length`: 1. It must be greater than `UX_HOST_CLASS_PIMA_DATA_HEADER_SIZE`. 1. It should be greater or equal to the current returned data length (`transfer_request -> ux_transfer_request_actual_length`).\n\n- CVE-2022-4338: An integer underflow in Organization Specific TLV was found in various versions of OpenvSwitch.\n\n- CVE-2021-31956: Windows NTFS Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2022-22715: Named Pipe File System Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-682 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-682 (ChildOf)",

NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2020-11736.\n\n- CVE-2021-21272: ORAS is open source software which enables a way to push OCI Artifacts to OCI Conformant registries. ORAS is both a CLI for initial testing and a Go Module. In ORAS from version 0.4.0 and before version 0.9.0, there is a \"zip-slip\" vulnerability. The directory support feature allows the downloaded gzipped tarballs to be automatically extracted to the user-specified directory where the tarball can have symbolic links and hard links. A well-crafted tarball or tarballs allow malicious artifact providers linking, writing, or overwriting specific files on the host filesystem outside of the user-specified directory unexpectedly with the same permissions as the user who runs `oras pull`. Users of the affected versions are impacted if they are `oras` CLI users who runs `oras pull`, or if they are Go programs, which invoke `github.com/deislabs/oras/pkg/content.FileStore`. The problem has been fixed in version 0.9.0. For `oras` CLI users, there is no workarounds other than pulling from a trusted artifact provider. For `oras` package users, the workaround is to not use `github.com/deislabs/oras/pkg/content.FileStore`, and use other content stores instead, or pull from a trusted artifact provider.\n\n- CVE-2021-28650: autoar-extractor.c in GNOME gnome-autoar before 0.3.1, as used by GNOME Shell, Nautilus, and other software, allows Directory Traversal during extraction because it lacks a check of whether a file's parent is a symlink in certain complex situations. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2020-36241.\n\n- CVE-2021-32518: A vulnerability in share_link in QSAN Storage Manager allows remote attackers to create a symbolic link then access arbitrary files. The referred vulnerability has been solved with the updated version of QSAN Storage Manager v3.3.3.\n\n- CVE-2021-32803: The npm package \"tar\" (aka node-tar) before versions 6.1.2, 5.0.7, 4.4.15, and 3.2.3 has an arbitrary File Creation/Overwrite vulnerability via insufficient symlink protection. `node-tar` aims to guarantee that any file whose location would be modified by a symbolic link is not extracted. This is, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary `stat` calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are created. This logic was insufficient when extracting tar files that contained both a directory and a symlink with the same name as the directory. This order of operations resulted in the directory being created and added to the `node-tar` directory cache. When a directory is present in the directory cache, subsequent calls to mkdir for that directory are skipped. However, this is also where `node-tar` checks for symlinks occur. By first creating a directory, and then replacing that directory with a symlink, it was thus possible to bypass `node-tar` symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar file to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary files into that location, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite. This issue was addressed in releases 3.2.3, 4.4.15, 5.0.7 and 6.1.2.\n\n- CVE-2021-32825: bblfshd is an open source self-hosted server for source code parsing. In bblfshd before commit 4265465b9b6fb5663c30ee43806126012066aad4 there is a \"zipslip\" vulnerability. The unsafe handling of symbolic links in an unpacking routine may enable attackers to read and/or write to arbitrary locations outside the designated target folder. This issue may lead to arbitrary file write (with same permissions as the program running the unpack operation) if the attacker can control the archive file. Additionally, if the attacker has read access to the unpacked files, he may be able to read arbitrary system files the parent process has permissions to read. For more details including a PoC see the referenced GHSL-2020-258.\n\n- CVE-2021-36286: Dell SupportAssist Client Consumer versions 3.9.13.0 and any versions prior to 3.9.13.0 contain an arbitrary file deletion vulnerability that can be exploited by using the Windows feature of NTFS called Symbolic links. Symbolic links can be created by any(non-privileged) user under some object directories, but by themselves are not sufficient to successfully escalate privileges. However, combining them with a different object, such as the NTFS junction point allows for the exploitation. Support assist clean files functionality do not distinguish junction points from the physical folder and proceeds to clean the target of the junction that allows nonprivileged users to create junction points and delete arbitrary files on the system which can be accessed only by the admin.\n\n- CVE-2021-38511: An issue was discovered in the tar crate before 0.4.36 for Rust. When symlinks are present in a TAR archive, extraction can create arbitrary directories via .. traversal.\n\n- CVE-2021-29136: Open Container Initiative umoci before 0.4.7 allows attackers to overwrite arbitrary host paths via a crafted image that causes symlink traversal when \"umoci unpack\" or \"umoci raw unpack\" is used.\n\n- CVE-2020-27833: A Zip Slip vulnerability was found in the oc binary in openshift-clients where an arbitrary file write is achieved by using a specially crafted raw container image (.tar file) which contains symbolic links. The vulnerability is limited to the command `oc image extract`. If a symbolic link is first created pointing within the tarball, this allows further symbolic links to bypass the existing path check. This flaw allows the tarball to create links outside the tarball's parent directory, allowing for executables or configuration files to be overwritten, resulting in arbitrary code execution. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability. Versions up to and including openshift-clients-4.7.0-202104250659.p0.git.95881af are affected.\n\n- CVE-2020-27697: Trend Micro Security 2020 (Consumer) contains a vulnerability in the installer package that could be exploited by placing a malicious DLL in a non-protected location with high privileges (symlink attack) which can lead to obtaining administrative privileges during the installation of the product.\n\n- CVE-2020-4717: A vulnerability exists in IBM SPSS Modeler Subscription Installer that allows a user with create symbolic link permission to write arbitrary file in another protected path during product installation. IBM X-Force ID: 187727.\n\n- CVE-2021-23239: The sudoedit personality of Sudo before 1.9.5 may allow a local unprivileged user to perform arbitrary directory-existence tests by winning a sudo_edit.c race condition in replacing a user-controlled directory by a symlink to an arbitrary path.\n\n- CVE-2021-32508: Absolute Path Traversal vulnerability in FileStreaming in QSAN Storage Manager allows remote authenticated attackers access arbitrary files by injecting the Symbolic Link following the Url path parameter. The referred vulnerability has been solved with the updated version of QSAN Storage Manager v3.3.3.\n\n- CVE-2021-32509: Absolute Path Traversal vulnerability in FileviewDoc in QSAN Storage Manager allows remote authenticated attackers access arbitrary files by injecting the Symbolic Link following the Url path parameter.

It affects multi-user setups in which \u2019guix-daemon\u2019 runs locally. The attack consists in having an unprivileged user spawn a build process, for instance with `guix build`, that makes its build directory world-writable. The user then creates a hardlink to a root-owned file such as /etc/shadow in that build directory. If the user passed the --keep-failed option and the build eventually fails, the daemon changes ownership of the whole build tree, including the hardlink, to the user. At that point, the user has write access to the target file. Versions after and including v0.11.0-3298-g2608e40988, and versions prior to v1.2.0-75109-g94f0312546 are vulnerable.\n\n- CVE-2020-28007: Exim 4 before 4.94.2 allows Execution with Unnecessary Privileges. Because Exim operates as root in the log directory (owned by a non-root user), a symlink or hard link attack allows overwriting critical root-owned files anywhere on the filesystem.\n\n- CVE-2021-22488: There is an Unauthorized file access vulnerability in Huawei Smartphone.Successful exploitation of this vulnerability by modifying soft links may tamper with the files restored from backups.\n\n- CVE-2021-23872: Privilege Escalation vulnerability in the File Lock component of McAfee Total Protection (MTP) prior to 16.0.32 allows a local user to gain elevated privileges by manipulating a symbolic link in the IOCTL interface.\n\n- CVE-2021-23873: Privilege Escalation vulnerability in McAfee Total Protection (MTP) prior to 16.0.30 allows a local user to gain elevated privileges and perform arbitrary file deletion as the SYSTEM user potentially causing Denial of Service via manipulating Junction link, after enumerating certain files, at a specific time.\n\n- CVE-2021-34408: The Zoom Client for Meetings for Windows in all versions before version 5.3.2 writes log files to a user writable directory as a privileged user during the installation or update of the client.

This vulnerability may potentially allow any local user to access system functionality and configuration information that should only be available to a privileged user. Affects versions 8.0.0.0 through 8.1.3.1 of AVPU.\n\n- CVE-2021-21290: Netty is an open-source, asynchronous event-driven network application framework for rapid development of maintainable high performance protocol servers & clients. In Netty before version 4.1.59.Final there is a vulnerability on Unix-like systems involving an insecure temp file. When netty's multipart decoders are used local information disclosure can occur via the local system temporary directory if temporary storing uploads on the disk is enabled. On unix-like systems, the temporary directory is shared between all user. As such, writing to this directory using APIs that do not explicitly set the file/directory permissions can lead to information disclosure. Of note, this does not impact modern MacOS Operating Systems. The method \"File.createTempFile\" on unix-like systems creates a random file, but, by default will create this file with the permissions \"-rw-r--r--\". Thus, if sensitive information is written to this file, other local users can read this information. This is the case in netty's \"AbstractDiskHttpData\" is vulnerable. This has been fixed in version 4.1.59.Final. As a workaround, one may specify your own \"java.io.tmpdir\" when you start the JVM or use \"DefaultHttpDataFactory.setBaseDir(...)\" to set the directory to something that is only readable by the current user.\n\n- CVE-2022-45935: Usage of temporary files with insecure permissions by the Apache James server allows an attacker with local access to access private user data in transit. Vulnerable components includes the SMTP stack and IMAP APPEND command. This issue affects Apache James server version 3.7.2 and prior versions.\n\n- CVE-2022-4817: A vulnerability was found in centic9 jgit-cookbook. It has been declared as problematic. This vulnerability affects unknown code. The manipulation leads to insecure temporary file. The attack can be initiated remotely. The name of the patch is b8cb29b43dc704708d598c60ac1881db7cf8e9c3. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The identifier of this vulnerability is VDB-216988.\n\n- CVE-2021-22572: On unix-like systems, the system temporary directory is shared between all users on that system. The root cause is File.createTempFile creates files in the the system temporary directory with world readable permissions. Any sensitive information written to theses files is visible to all other local users on unix-like systems. We recommend upgrading past commit https://github.com/google/data-transfer-project/pull/969\n\n- CVE-2022-24823: Netty is an open-source, asynchronous event-driven network application framework. The package `io.netty:netty-codec-http` prior to version 4.1.77.Final contains an insufficient fix for CVE-2021-21290. When Netty's multipart decoders are used local information disclosure can occur via the local system temporary directory if temporary storing uploads on the disk is enabled. This only impacts applications running on Java version 6 and lower. Additionally, this vulnerability impacts code running on Unix-like systems, and very old versions of Mac OSX and Windows as they all share the system temporary directory between all users. Version 4.1.77.Final contains a patch for this vulnerability. As a workaround, specify one's own `java.io.tmpdir` when starting the JVM or use DefaultHttpDataFactory.setBaseDir(...) to set the directory to something that is only readable by the current user.\n\n- CVE-2022-24411: Dell PowerScale OneFS 8.2.2 and above contain an elevation of privilege vulnerability. A local attacker with ISI_PRIV_LOGIN_SSH and/or ISI_PRIV_LOGIN_CONSOLE could potentially exploit this vulnerability, leading to elevation of privilege.

If `axis` is provided (i.e., not `-1`), then validation should check that it is a value in range for the rank of `input` tensor and then the lengths of `min_range` and `max_range` inputs match the `axis` dimension of the `input` tensor. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 6da6620efad397c85493b8f8667b821403516708. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0.

Modules for TCP syslog reception have a potential heap buffer overflow when octet-counted framing is used. This can result in a segfault or some other malfunction. As of our understanding, this vulnerability can not be used for remote code execution. But there may still be a slight chance for experts to do that. The bug occurs when the octet count is read. While there is a check for the maximum number of octets, digits are written to a heap buffer even when the octet count is over the maximum, This can be used to overrun the memory buffer. However, once the sequence of digits stop, no additional characters can be added to the buffer. In our opinion, this makes remote exploits impossible or at least highly complex. Octet-counted framing is one of two potential framing modes. It is relatively uncommon, but enabled by default on receivers. Modules `imtcp`, `imptcp`, `imgssapi`, and `imhttp` are used for regular syslog message reception. It is best practice not to directly expose them to the public. When this practice is followed, the risk is considerably lower. Module `imdiag` is a diagnostics module primarily intended for testbench runs. We do not expect it to be present on any production installation. Octet-counted framing is not very common. Usually, it needs to be specifically enabled at senders. If users do not need it, they can turn it off for the most important modules. This will mitigate the vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2022-25727: Memory Corruption in modem due to improper length check while copying into memory in Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Voice & Music\n\n- CVE-2022-25793: A Stack-based Buffer Overflow Vulnerability in Autodesk 3ds Max 2022, 2021, and 2020 may lead to code execution through the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer when parsing ActionScript Byte Code files.

Azure RTOS USBX implementation of host support for USB CDC ECM includes an integer underflow and a buffer overflow in the `_ux_host_class_cdc_ecm_mac_address_get` function which may be potentially exploited to achieve remote code execution or denial of service. Setting mac address string descriptor length to a `0` or `1` allows an attacker to introduce an integer underflow followed (string_length) by a buffer overflow of the `cdc_ecm -> ux_host_class_cdc_ecm_node_id` array. This may allow one to redirect the code execution flow or introduce a denial of service. The fix has been included in USBX release [6.1.12](https://github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/releases/tag/v6.1.12_rel). Improved mac address string descriptor length validation to check for unexpectedly small values may be used as a workaround.\n\n- CVE-2022-36620: D-link DIR-816 A2_v1.10CNB04, DIR-878 DIR_878_FW1.30B08.img is vulnerable to Buffer Overflow via /goform/addRouting.\n\n- CVE-2022-37134: D-link DIR-816 A2_v1.10CNB04.img is vulnerable to Buffer Overflow via /goform/form2Wan.cgi.

Prior to version 0.10.2, the heap initialization methods were missing a minimum size check for the given heap size argument. This could lead to out-of-bound writes when a heap was initialized with a size smaller than `3 * size_of::<usize>` because of metadata write operations. This vulnerability impacts all the initialization functions on the `Heap` and `LockedHeap` types, including `Heap::new`, `Heap::init`, `Heap::init_from_slice`, and `LockedHeap::new`. It also affects multiple uses of the `Heap::extend` method. Version 0.10.2 contains a patch for the issue. As a workaround, ensure that the heap is only initialized with a size larger than `3 * size_of::<usize>` and that the `Heap::extend` method is only called with sizes larger than `2 * size_of::<usize>()`. Also, ensure that the total heap size is (and stays) a multiple of `2 * size_of::<usize>()`.\n\n- CVE-2022-36938: DexLoader function get_stringidx_fromdex() in Redex prior to commit 3b44c64 can load an out of bound address when loading the string index table, potentially allowing remote code execution during processing of a 3rd party Android APK file.\n\n- CVE-2021-1058: NVIDIA vGPU software contains a vulnerability in the guest kernel mode driver and vGPU plugin, in which an input data size is not validated, which may lead to tampering of data or denial of service.

Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, the implementation of `tf.ragged.constant` does not fully validate the input arguments. This results in a denial of service by consuming all available memory. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-36078: Binary provides encoding/decoding in Borsh and other formats. The vulnerability is a memory allocation vulnerability that can be exploited to allocate slices in memory with (arbitrary) excessive size value, which can either exhaust available memory or crash the whole program. When using `github.com/gagliardetto/binary` to parse unchecked (or wrong type of) data from untrusted sources of input (e.g. the blockchain) into slices, it's possible to allocate memory with excessive size. When `dec.Decode(&val)` method is used to parse data into a structure that is or contains slices of values, the length of the slice was previously read directly from the data itself without any checks on the size of it, and then a slice was allocated. This could lead to an overflow and an allocation of memory with excessive size value. Users should upgrade to `v0.7.1` or higher. A workaround is not to rely on the `dec.Decode(&val)` function to parse the data, but to use a custom `UnmarshalWithDecoder()` method that reads and checks the length of any slice.\n\n- CVE-2022-37311: OX App Suite through 7.10.6 has Uncontrolled Resource Consumption via a large location request parameter to the redirect servlet.\n\n- CVE-2022-37312: OX App Suite through 7.10.6 has Uncontrolled Resource Consumption via a large request body containing a redirect URL to the deferrer servlet.\n\n- CVE-2022-39294: conduit-hyper integrates a conduit application with the hyper server. Prior to version 0.4.2, `conduit-hyper` did not check any limit on a request's length before calling [`hyper::body::to_bytes`](https://docs.rs/hyper/latest/hyper/body/fn.to_bytes.html). An attacker could send a malicious request with an abnormally large `Content-Length`, which could lead to a panic if memory allocation failed for that request. In version 0.4.2, `conduit-hyper` sets an internal limit of 128 MiB per request, otherwise returning status 400 (\"Bad Request\"). This crate is part of the implementation of Rust's [crates.io](https://crates.io/), but that service is not affected due to its existing cloud infrastructure, which already drops such malicious requests. Even with the new limit in place, `conduit-hyper` is not recommended for production use, nor to directly serve the public Internet.\n\n- CVE-2022-4111: Unrestricted file size limit can lead to DoS in tooljet/tooljet <1.27 by allowing a logged in attacker to upload profile pictures over 2MB. \n\n- CVE-2022-41968: Nextcloud Server is an open source personal cloud server. Prior to versions 23.0.10 and 24.0.5, calendar name lengths are not validated before writing to a database. As a result, an attacker can send unnecessary amounts of data against the database. Version 23.0.10 and 24.0.5 contain patches for the issue. No known workarounds are available.\n\n- CVE-2022-20488: In NotificationChannel of NotificationChannel.java, there is a possible failure to persist permissions settings due to resource exhaustion. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-10 Android-11 Android-12 Android-12L Android-13Android ID: A-242703217\n\n- CVE-2022-20491: In NotificationChannel of NotificationChannel.java, there is a possible failure to persist permissions settings due to resource exhaustion. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-10 Android-11 Android-12 Android-12L Android-13Android ID: A-242703556\n\n- CVE-2022-20691: A vulnerability in the Cisco Discovery Protocol functionality of Cisco ATA 190 Series Adaptive Telephone Adapter firmware could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a DoS condition of an affected device. This vulnerability is due to missing length validation of certain Cisco Discovery Protocol packet header fields. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted Cisco Discovery Protocol packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to exhaust available memory and cause the service to restart. Cisco has released firmware updates that address this vulnerability. \n\n- CVE-2022-21208: The package node-opcua before 2.74.0 are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) due to a missing limitation on the number of received chunks - per single session or in total for all concurrent sessions. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending an unlimited number of huge chunks (e.g. 2GB each) without sending the Final closing chunk.\n\n- CVE-2022-29212: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, certain TFLite models that were created using TFLite model converter would crash when loaded in the TFLite interpreter. The culprit is that during quantization the scale of values could be greater than 1 but code was always assuming sub-unit scaling. Thus, since code was calling `QuantizeMultiplierSmallerThanOneExp`, the `TFLITE_CHECK_LT` assertion would trigger and abort the process. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-29196: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.Conv3DBackpropFilterV2` does not fully validate the input arguments. This results in a `CHECK`-failure which can be used to trigger a denial of service attack. The code does not validate that the `filter_sizes` argument is a vector. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-29200: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.LSTMBlockCell` does not fully validate the input arguments. This results in a `CHECK`-failure which can be used to trigger a denial of service attack. The code does not validate the ranks of any of the arguments to this API call. This results in `CHECK`-failures when the elements of the tensor are accessed. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-20 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-20 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-789 (CanPrecede)",

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have a valid account on an affected device. The vulnerability exists because the affected software incorrectly runs the SFTP user service at the privilege level of the account that was running when the ConfD built-in Secure Shell (SSH) server for CLI was enabled. If the ConfD built-in SSH server was not enabled, the device is not affected by this vulnerability. An attacker with low-level privileges could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to an affected device and issuing a series of commands at the SFTP interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to elevate privileges to the level of the account under which ConfD is running, which is commonly root. Note: Any user who can authenticate to the built-in SSH server may exploit this vulnerability. By default, all ConfD users have this access if the server is enabled.

Applications can create a hard link from one directory to another directory, called a junction point. They can also create a mapping from a directory to a drive letter, called a mount point. If a file is used by a privileged program, but it can be replaced with a hard link to a sensitive file (e.g., AUTOEXEC.BAT), an attacker could excalate privileges. When the process opens the file, the attacker can assume the privileges of that process, tricking the privileged process to read, modify, or delete the sensitive file, preventing the program from accurately processing data. Note that one can also point to registries and semaphores.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-26426: Privileged service allows attackers to delete unauthorized files using a directory junction, leading to arbitrary code execution as SYSTEM.\n\n- CVE-2020-0863: By creating a mount point and hard links, an attacker can abuse a service to allow users arbitrary file read permissions.\n\n- CVE-2019-1161: Chain: race condition (CWE-362) in anti-malware product allows deletion of files by creating a junction (CWE-1386) and using hard links during the time window in which a temporary file is created and deleted.\n\n- CVE-2014-0568: Escape from sandbox for document reader by using a mountpoint [REF-1264]\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-21919: Windows User Profile Service Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2022-36336: A link following vulnerability in the scanning function of Trend Micro Apex One and Worry-Free Business Security agents could allow a local attacker to escalate privileges on affected installations. The resolution for this issue has been deployed automatically via ActiveUpdate to customers in an updated Spyware pattern. Customers who are up-to-date on detection patterns are not required to take any additional steps to mitigate this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-0799: Insufficient policy enforcement in Installer in Google Chrome on Windows prior to 99.0.4844.51 allowed a remote attacker to perform local privilege escalation via a crafted offline installer file.\n\n- CVE-2022-34008: Comodo Antivirus 12.2.2.8012 has a quarantine flaw that allows privilege escalation. To escalate privilege, a low-privileged attacker can use an NTFS directory junction to restore a malicious DLL from quarantine into the System32 folder.\n\n- CVE-2022-21895: Windows User Profile Service Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-59 (ChildOf)",
