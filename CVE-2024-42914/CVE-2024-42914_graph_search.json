By sending a specially crafted host header in the forgot password request, it is possible to send password reset links to users which, once clicked, lead to an attacker-controlled server and thus leak the password reset token. This may allow an attacker to reset other users passwords. Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-620 CWE-1390 CWE-640 CWE-89 CWE-472 CWE-256 CWE-352 CWE-259 CWE-346 CWE-74",
