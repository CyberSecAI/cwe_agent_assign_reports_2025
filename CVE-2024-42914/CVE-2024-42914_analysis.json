  "description": "A **host header injection** vulnerability exists in the forgot password functionality of ArrowCMS version 1.0.0. By sending a specially crafted host header in the forgot password request, it is possible to send password reset links to users which, once clicked, lead to an attacker-controlled server and thus leak the password reset token. This may allow an attacker to reset other users passwords.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2024-42914:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n- The vulnerability stems from the \"Forgot Password\" functionality in ArrowCMS version 1.0.0 which is susceptible to a host header injection. Specifically, the application does not properly validate or sanitize the host header in the request, leading to the possibility of manipulating the password reset link generation.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Host Header Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the application's failure to validate the \"Host\" header in the password reset request. This allows an attacker to inject a malicious host, causing the password reset email to contain a link pointing to an attacker-controlled server.\n- **Lack of Input Sanitization/Validation:** The application lacks proper input validation for the host header, which makes it vulnerable to the attack.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Password Reset Token Leakage:** By controlling the host in the reset link, the attacker can have the reset token sent to their own server when the user clicks the malicious link, instead of the intended reset link.\n- **Account Takeover:** Once the attacker has the password reset token, they can reset the user's password and gain unauthorized access to the account.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Malicious \"Host\" Header:** The attacker crafts a password reset request and includes a malicious `Host` header, such as `Host: attacker-controlled.com`. This modified header is then used by the application to generate the password reset email.\n- **Email Phishing:** The victim receives an email that looks legitimate but contains a link leading to a server controlled by the attacker.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Ability to Send HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the ArrowCMS application with a modified `Host` header. This can typically be achieved with tools such as curl, or by crafting an application that performs the request.\n- **Knowledge of Existing User:** The attacker needs to know the email address of an existing user on the system to trigger the reset password functionality.\n- **Attacker Controlled Server:** The attacker requires a server that they control to receive and capture the password reset token from the victim.\n\n**Summary of the vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability lies in the fact that the \"Forgot Password\" function does not sanitize the host header before generating a password reset link. This can allow an attacker to redirect the victim to an attacker-controlled server where they could capture the password reset token and takeover the user's account.",

While CWE-640 doesn't have direct parent-child relationships with other CWEs listed, its description aligns well with the **weakness** of improper handling of the \"Host\" header during password reset. CWE-472 [External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter] is a related weakness, as the Host header is an externally controlled parameter that is assumed to be properly handled, but isn't. CWE-74 [Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')] is a higher-level class that could apply, but CWE-640 and CWE-472 provide more specific classifications.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe640[\"CWE-640: Weak Password Recovery Mechanism for Forgotten Password\"]\n    cwe472[\"CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    \n\n    cwe472 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe89 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe640 primary\n    class cwe472,cwe74 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **weakness** in the password recovery mechanism.\n1.  **Root Cause:** CWE-640 [Weak Password Recovery Mechanism for Forgotten Password] due to **improper** handling of the Host header.\n2.

The final decision to focus on CWE-640 [Weak Password Recovery Mechanism for Forgotten Password] as the primary CWE is based on the following evidence:\n\n*   The vulnerability description explicitly mentions the \"forgot password functionality\" and how it's vulnerable to host header injection.\n*   The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the root cause lies in the application's failure to validate the Host header in the password reset request, leading to a manipulated password reset link. \"The vulnerability lies in the fact that the 'Forgot Password' function does not sanitize the host header before generating a password reset link.\"\n*   CWE-640 [Weak Password Recovery Mechanism for Forgotten Password] specifically addresses **weaknesses** in password recovery mechanisms, aligning with the vulnerability's core issue.\n*   CWE-472 [External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter] applies to the external control of the Host header, an externally controlled parameter.\n*   CWE-74 [Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')] is a broader, higher-level CWE, making it less specific than CWE-640 [Weak Password Recovery Mechanism for Forgotten Password] in this context. Its discouraged usage further supports not using it as primary.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly address the **weakness** in the password recovery mechanism and the external control of the Host header, without being overly broad or abstract.\n\nCWEs considered but not used as primary:\n\n*   CWE-89 [Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')]: This CWE is not relevant as the vulnerability does not involve SQL injection.\n*   CWE-346 [Origin Validation Error]: While related to header manipulation, it's not as directly relevant as CWE-640 [Weak Password Recovery Mechanism for Forgotten Password].\n*   CWE-256 [Plaintext Storage of a Password]: This CWE is not relevant as there's no mention of passwords being stored in plaintext.\n*   CWE-1390 [Weak Authentication] and CWE-287 [Improper Authentication]: These are too general and not specific to the password reset mechanism.\n*   CWE-290 [Authentication Bypass by Spoofing]: This is not the primary issue, as the vulnerability focuses on manipulating the password reset process, not bypassing authentication directly.",

Improper validation of data that are user-controllable can lead to the application processing incorrect, and often malicious, input.\n\n\nFor example, custom cookies commonly store session data or persistent data across sessions. This kind of session data is normally involved in security related decisions on the server side, such as user authentication and access control.
