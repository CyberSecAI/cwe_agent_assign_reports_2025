This vulnerability affects the function processFile of the file internal/unpack/unpack.go of the component wxapkg File Parser. The manipulation leads to os command injection. The attack can be initiated remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation appears to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.",
