### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **sql injection**
- **product:** 1000 Projects Portfolio Management System
- **version:** MCA 1.0
- **component:** /forgot_password_process.php

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The root cause of the vulnerability is a SQL injection in the `/forgot_password_process.php` file. This occurs because user input from the `username` parameter is directly used in SQL queries without proper sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of input sanitization for the `username` parameter, allowing malicious SQL code injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Database Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database.
- **Sensitive Data Leakage:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database.
- **Data Tampering:** Attackers can modify or delete data.
- **System Control:** Attackers could potentially gain comprehensive control over the system.
- **Service Interruption:** Attackers could cause a disruption in service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `username` parameter in the `/forgot_password_process.php` file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send a POST request to `/forgot_password_process.php` with a malicious payload in the `username` parameter.
- No login or authorization is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
- Vulnerable File: `/forgot_password_process.php`
- Vulnerable Parameter: `username` (POST)
- Example Payload (boolean-based blind): `username=-5990' OR 5592=5592-- kkQZ&submit=Submit`
- Example Payload (time-based blind): `username=12@qq.com' AND (SELECT 6213 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))rJhE)-- LIaf&submit=Submit`
- SQLMap was used to identify this vulnerability.
- The application version affected is V1.0

**Mitigation:**
The following mitigations are suggested:
1. Use prepared statements and parameter binding.
2. Input validation and filtering.
3. Minimize database user permissions.
4. Regular security audits.
