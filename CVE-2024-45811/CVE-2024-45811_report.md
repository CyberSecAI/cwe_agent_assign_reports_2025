# Analysis Report for CVE-2024-45811

# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-45811

## Description

Vite a frontend build tooling framework for javascript. In affected versions the contents of arbitrary files can be returned to the browser. `@fs` denies access to files outside of Vite serving allow list. Adding `?import&raw` to the URL bypasses this limitation and returns the file content if it exists. This issue has been patched in versions 5.4.6, 5.3.6, 5.2.14, 4.5.5, and 3.2.11. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Impact:** arbitrary file disclosure
- **Vector:** Adding ?import&raw to the URL
- **Product:** Vite
- **Version:** before 5.4.6, 5.3.6, 5.2.14, 4.5.5, and 3.2.11

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-284 | Improper Access Control | 0.9 | Class | Primary CWE | Allowed-with-Review |
| CWE-200 | Information Exposure | 0.8 | Class | Secondary | Allowed-with-Review |
| CWE-22 | Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') | 0.6 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is **CWE-284 [Improper Access Control]**, a class-level CWE. The vulnerability involves bypassing access controls intended to restrict file access. **CWE-200 [Information Exposure]** is a related class-level CWE, representing the direct consequence of the access control bypass. **CWE-22 [Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')]**, a base-level CWE, is considered since the vulnerability involves accessing files outside of the allowed directory, but it's less precise than **CWE-284 [Improper Access Control]** because the described bypass doesn't necessarily rely on path traversal techniques.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with an **improper access control** (**CWE-284 [Improper Access Control]**) which allows bypassing the `@fs` restriction. This leads to **information exposure** (**CWE-200 [Information Exposure]**) because the contents of arbitrary files can then be accessed.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis identifies **CWE-284 [Improper Access Control]** as the primary weakness, with **CWE-200 [Information Exposure]** as a secondary impact. The vulnerability description and CVE details highlight the bypass of intended access controls using the `?import&raw` parameter.
The evidence from the "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" section is crucial:
- "The primary weakness is the ability to bypass the intended restrictions of `server.fs.deny` by using the `?import&raw` query parameter."
- "This bypass allows an attacker to retrieve the contents of arbitrary files on the server's filesystem."

These statements directly support the selection of **CWE-284 [Improper Access Control]** as the primary cause and **CWE-200 [Information Exposure]** as the result. While **CWE-22 [Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')]** was considered, the specific bypass mechanism (`?import&raw`) doesn't necessitate path traversal, making **CWE-284 [Improper Access Control]** a more accurate representation of the root cause.

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.
