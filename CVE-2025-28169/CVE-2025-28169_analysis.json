  "reference_content": "## CVE-2025-28169 Analysis\n\nThe provided content from gist.github.com_d6e8adc9_20250624_132742.html is **RELEVANT** to CVE-2025-28169. It details a vulnerability in BYD QIN PLUS DM-i vehicles running Dilink OS. The other two provided URLs from byd.com are unrelated and do not contain vulnerability information.\n\nHere's an extraction of the relevant information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe `/system/priv-app/CanDataCollect` folder is accessible to regular users, allowing extraction and analysis of `CanDataCollect.apk`. The `com.byd.data_collection_notify` broadcast is not system-protected.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Incorrect Access Control\n*   Lack of proper permission restrictions on sensitive data access.\n*   Unprotected broadcast receiver allowing modification of CAN traffic upload URL.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   Bypass of permission restrictions.\n*   Obtaining confidential vehicle data via CAN Traffic Hijacking.\n*   Remote analysis of the car's driving status.\n*   Prevention of cloud data collection by setting the upload URL to null.\n*   Remote CAN traffic collection by redirecting the upload URL to an attacker\u2019s domain.\n*   Decoding of CAN traffic to infer vehicle status.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Installation and execution of a malicious app with normal permissions on the IVI system.\n*   Exploitation of the unprotected broadcast receiver to modify the CAN traffic upload URL.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   Ability to install apps on the IVI system.\n*   Reverse engineering skills to analyze `CanDataCollect.apk` and decode CAN traffic.\n*   Network access to receive CAN traffic if redirecting to an attacker-controlled server.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\nThe report states the vulnerability has been reported to and addressed by the manufacturer in the latest versions. (Specific details of the fix are not provided in the content).\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\nThe content provides significantly more detail than a typical CVE description, including specific file paths, code snippets (screenshots), and step-by-step exploitation instructions. It also includes a disclaimer stating the report is for informational purposes only and should not be used for malicious activities.",

CWE-306 and CWE-345 are related to the broader context of security failures that could enable or exacerbate the vulnerability. While CWE-306 is a child of the broader CWE-287 (Improper Authentication), the missing system protection on the broadcast highlights the absence of authentication for a critical function. Similarly, CWE-347 (Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature) is a child of CWE-345 (Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity), but the unencrypted transmission is more directly captured by CWE-319.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe345[\"CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe347[\"CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature\"]\n    \n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe347 -->|CHILDOF| cwe345\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe319 primary\n    class cwe306,cwe345 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **root cause** of unencrypted broadcast transmissions (CWE-319). The **lack of system protection** (indicated by the unprotected broadcast receiver) can be considered **Missing Authentication for a Critical Function** (CWE-306) or perhaps **Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity** (CWE-345), which facilitates the man-in-the-middle attack. The impact is the potential for attackers to intercept and analyze sensitive vehicle data.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on identifying the **root cause** of the vulnerability. The primary evidence is the description of the vulnerability in BYD QIN PLUS DM-i Dilink OS, specifically that it \"cend broadcasts to the manufacturer's cloud server unencrypted, allowing attackers to execute a man-in-the-middle attack.\"\n\nThe retriever results and complete CWE specifications were then analyzed. CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information) was identified as the best fit for the **root cause**. This is further supported by the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which highlights the unprotected broadcast receiver that allows modification of the CAN traffic upload URL. This unprotected broadcast implies a **Missing Authentication for Critical Function** (CWE-306), making it a relevant secondary CWE. The possibility of **Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity** (CWE-345) is also considered, as the vulnerability might also involve a lack of integrity checks.\n\nThe abstraction level of CWE-319 is Base, which is the preferred level. Other considered CWEs, such as CWE-287 (Improper Authentication), are Class level and less specific. The final selection is based on direct evidence and the MITRE mapping guidance, favoring specific Base level CWEs over broader Class level CWEs when applicable.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n- Vulnerability Description Key Phrases:\n  - **impact:** cend broadcasts to the manufacturers cloud server unencrypted\n- CVE Reference Links Content Summary:\n  - **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n    - Unprotected broadcast receiver allowing modification of CAN traffic upload URL.",
