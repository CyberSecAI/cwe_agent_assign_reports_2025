# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-46957

## Vulnerability Description
Mellium mellium.im/xmpp 0.0.1 through 0.21.4 allows **response spoofing** if the implementation uses **predictable IDs** because the stanza type is not checked. This is fixed in 0.22.0.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **predictable IDs**
- **weakness:** **response spoofing**
- **product:** Mellium mellium.im/xmpp
- **version:** 0.0.1 through 0.21.4

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-46957:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from incorrect stanza handling in `mellium.im/xmpp`. Specifically, the library matched IQ (Info/Query) and other stanza responses based solely on their ID, without verifying the stanza type.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Stanza Matching:** The library used only the ID to match responses, failing to distinguish between different stanza types (e.g., IQ, message, presence).
*   **Type Confusion:** This allowed a presence or message stanza with an ID matching a pending IQ to be incorrectly processed as if it were an IQ response.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Bypassing Server Safety Checks:** A malicious actor could potentially bypass server-side checks. By sending a crafted presence or message stanza with a matching ID, they could trick the client into interpreting it as a response to a different IQ.
*  **Arbitrary IQ Responses:** By crafting a message or presence stanza, an attacker can effectively respond to an IQ they were not intended to respond to. This could, in turn, allow them to circumvent security measures enforced by servers to maintain secure sessions.
*   **Potential for Data Injection/Manipulation:** If handlers do not verify the type, a malicious actor can inject crafted data into the handler for IQs, leading to unexpected behaviors.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** An attacker could intercept network traffic and inject malicious stanzas with IDs that match pending IQ requests.
*   **Compromised Client/Server:** If an attacker compromises a client or server they could send the malicious stanzas.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send stanzas to the target client (e.g., by being on the same network or through a compromised server).
*  **Predictable ID Generation (or Known ID):** To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker would need to either guess the current stanza IDs or somehow know them if the application does not use secure random ID generation. This could be easier if the client generates predictable IDs and the client also does not verify the stanza type before processing it.

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability is fixed in `mellium.im/xmpp` version `v0.22.0` and later.
*   The default ID generation in `mellium.im/xmpp` is believed to be secure. However, users generating custom IDs are warned to use unpredictable IDs.
* The provided `mellium.im` content provides more detail than the official CVE description, specifically in outlining how to exploit this vulnerability.
