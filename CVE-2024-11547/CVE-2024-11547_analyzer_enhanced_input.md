## Vulnerability Description
IrfanView DWG File Parsing Memory Corruption Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of IrfanView. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of DWG files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a **memory corruption** condition. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-24732.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the improper parsing of DWG files due to the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, leading to a memory corruption condition.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory corruption vulnerability due to insufficient validation of data within DWG files.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process. This can lead to complete control of the system, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote attackers can trigger the vulnerability by either tricking a user into visiting a malicious page or opening a malicious DWG file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to deliver a specially crafted DWG file to the victim, either through a malicious website or direct file transfer. User interaction is necessary as the user has to open the malicious file or visit the malicious page for exploitation to occur.
