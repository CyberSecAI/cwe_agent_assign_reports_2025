# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-41672

## Vulnerability Description
DuckDB is a SQL database management system. In versions 1.0.0 and prior, content in filesystem is accessible for reading using `sniff_csv`, even with `enable_external_access=false`. This vulnerability provides an attacker with access to filesystem even when access is expected to be disabled and other similar functions do NOT provide access. There seem to be two vectors to this vulnerability. First, access to files that should otherwise not be allowed. Second, the content from a file can be read (e.g. `/etc/hosts`, `proc/self/environ`, etc) even though that doesnt seem to be the intent of the sniff_csv function. A fix for this issue is available in commit c9b7c98aa0e1cd7363fe8bb8543a95f38e980d8a and is expected to be part of version 1.1.0.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** access to filesystem
- **product:** DuckDB
- **version:** 1.0.0 and prior
- **component:** sniff_csv

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-41672:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `sniff_csv` function in DuckDB was not respecting the `enable_external_access` configuration setting. Even when external access was disabled, `sniff_csv` could still access and read files from the filesystem.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Bypass of access control:** The `sniff_csv` function was bypassing the intended restriction set by `enable_external_access=false`.
- **Information Disclosure:** Ability to read contents of arbitrary files that should otherwise be protected.
- **Incorrect function behavior**: The `sniff_csv` function was reading file contents, even though it is intended to only provide information about the shape of the data, not the data itself.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could gain access to sensitive information from the filesystem, such as environment variables, configuration files, and other system data. This could lead to further exploitation and privilege escalation.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker can use the `sniff_csv` function with a path to a file on the system to read its contents. This is done through SQL queries.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to execute SQL queries against a vulnerable DuckDB instance.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered during a pentest.
- The vulnerability exists in version 1.0.0 and is fixed in 1.1.0.
- The workaround is to disable the `LocalFileSystem` using the `disabled_filesystems` setting.
- The fix involves disabling `sniff_csv` when `enable_external_access` is not set, as shown in the code changes.
- The fix was implemented in pull request #13133.
- The vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2024-41672.
