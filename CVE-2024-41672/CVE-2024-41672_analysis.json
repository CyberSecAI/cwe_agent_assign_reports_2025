  "description": "DuckDB is a SQL database management system. In versions 1.0.0 and prior, content in filesystem is accessible for reading using `sniff_csv`, even with `enable_external_access=false`. This vulnerability provides an attacker with access to filesystem even when access is expected to be disabled and other similar functions do NOT provide access. There seem to be two vectors to this vulnerability. First, access to files that should otherwise not be allowed. Second, the content from a file can be read (e.g. `/etc/hosts`, `proc/self/environ`, etc) even though that doesnt seem to be the intent of the sniff_csv function. A fix for this issue is available in commit c9b7c98aa0e1cd7363fe8bb8543a95f38e980d8a and is expected to be part of version 1.1.0.",

Even when external access was disabled, `sniff_csv` could still access and read files from the filesystem.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- **Bypass of access control:** The `sniff_csv` function was bypassing the intended restriction set by `enable_external_access=false`.\n- **Information Disclosure:** Ability to read contents of arbitrary files that should otherwise be protected.\n- **Incorrect function behavior**: The `sniff_csv` function was reading file contents, even though it is intended to only provide information about the shape of the data, not the data itself.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- An attacker could gain access to sensitive information from the filesystem, such as environment variables, configuration files, and other system data. This could lead to further exploitation and privilege escalation.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- An attacker can use the `sniff_csv` function with a path to a file on the system to read its contents. This is done through SQL queries.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- The attacker needs to be able to execute SQL queries against a vulnerable DuckDB instance.\n\n**Additional details:**\n- The vulnerability was discovered during a pentest.\n- The vulnerability exists in version 1.0.0 and is fixed in 1.1.0.\n- The workaround is to disable the `LocalFileSystem` using the `disabled_filesystems` setting.\n- The fix involves disabling `sniff_csv` when `enable_external_access` is not set, as shown in the code changes.\n- The fix was implemented in pull request #13133.\n- The vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2024-41672.",

The `sniff_csv` function **incorrectly authorizes** access to files when `enable_external_access` is set to false. |\n| CWE-200 | Exposure of Sensitive Information | 0.7 | Class | Allowed | Secondary. This is due to the **impact** of the vulnerability which gives an attacker access to sensitive information. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-863, which is a Class-level CWE. There isn't a more specific Base or Variant CWE that fits the description. CWE-863 relates to the product performing authorization checks incorrectly. The secondary CWE is CWE-200 which is a Class-level CWE that indicates there is sensitive information exposed.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    \n    cwe863 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe200\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n    class cwe668 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the **incorrect authorization** in `sniff_csv` function (CWE-863), which allows access to the filesystem despite `enable_external_access` being set to false. This leads to **exposure of sensitive information** (CWE-200) through the ability to read arbitrary files.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is that the `sniff_csv` function **bypasses access controls** which leads to **information disclosure**. This aligns with CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization), where authorization checks are performed, but incorrectly. The **impact** of the authorization bypass leads to the exposure of sensitive information.\n\nThe evidence for this is:\n- \"The `sniff_csv` function in DuckDB was not respecting the `enable_external_access` configuration setting. Even when external access was disabled, `sniff_csv` could still access and read files from the filesystem.\" (CVE Reference Links Content Summary)\n\nThe CWE-863 is a more accurate and specific representation of the vulnerability than other candidate CWEs (like CWE-306 or CWE-923). While CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) could be considered, the function isn't completely missing authentication/authorization, but is instead doing it incorrectly. Similarly, CWE-923 (Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints) doesn't accurately capture the authorization issue.\n\nThe selection of CWE-863 is at the appropriate level of specificity because it captures the root cause. A more general CWE like CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere) would not be specific enough.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as
