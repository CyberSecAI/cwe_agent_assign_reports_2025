## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-4739 Content

Based on the provided content, this relates to a SQL injection vulnerability in "Hospital Database Management System Project using PHP & MySQL" version 1.0. The CVE description is missing, but the content provides more detail than a standard CVE description would.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of proper input validation and sanitization of the 'Med\_ID' parameter in the `/medicines_info.php` file.  The application directly uses this parameter in SQL queries without appropriate cleaning, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   SQL Injection

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Unauthorized database access
*   Sensitive data leakage
*   Data tampering
*   System control
*   Service interruption

**Attack vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is exploitable via the 'Med\_ID' POST parameter in `/medicines_info.php`.
*   No login or authorization is required.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to send a crafted POST request to the `/medicines_info.php` endpoint. No authentication is required.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   Use prepared statements and parameter binding.
*   Implement strict input validation and filtering.
*   Minimize database user permissions.
*   Conduct regular security audits.

**Payload Examples:**

The content provides example payloads for error-based and time-based blind SQL injection attacks using `sqlmap`.

*   **Error-based:** `Med_ID=1' AND GTID_SUBSET(CONCAT(0x7176707071,(SELECT (ELT(2505=2505,1))),0x716b7a6271),2505) AND 'CiOU'='CiOU`
*   **Time-based blind:** `Med_ID=1' AND (SELECT 8880 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))UMkG) AND 'ubHj'='ubHj`
