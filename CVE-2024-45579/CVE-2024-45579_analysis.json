This leads to memory corruption, which results in an out-of-bounds write.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nBased on the vulnerability description, the root cause is a **missing memory requirement check**. This can lead to **memory corruption**, specifically an out-of-bounds write.\n\nThe primary CWE is CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write), as the vulnerability ultimately leads to writing data outside the intended memory boundaries. This is supported by the description stating \"**Memory corruption** may occur ... due to a **missing memory requirement check**.\"\n\nCWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input) is a secondary candidate because the **missing memory requirement check** can be viewed as a failure to validate the quantity of memory requested.\n\nCWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) is a more general CWE, and while it applies, CWE-787 is more specific.
