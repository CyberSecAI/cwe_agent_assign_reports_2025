It is capable of protecting workloads across on-premises, virtualized, containerized, and cloud-based environments. This vulnerability occurs when the system has weak privilege access, that allows an attacker to do privilege escalation. In this case the attacker is able to view agent list on Wazuh dashboard with no privilege access. This issue has been addressed in release version 4.9.1 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-863 CWE-732 CWE-639 CWE-201 CWE-269 CWE-250 CWE-267 CWE-266 CWE-287 CWE-425",
