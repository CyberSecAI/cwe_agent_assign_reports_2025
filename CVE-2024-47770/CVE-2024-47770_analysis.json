  "description": "Wazuh is a free and open source platform used for threat prevention, detection, and response. It is capable of protecting workloads across on-premises, virtualized, containerized, and cloud-based environments. This vulnerability occurs when the system has **weak privilege access**, that allows an attacker to do privilege escalation. In this case the attacker is able to view agent list on Wazuh dashboard with no privilege access. This issue has been addressed in release version 4.9.1 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",

It provides more detail than the official CVE description (which was a placeholder).\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nWeak privilege access control in the Wazuh dashboard allows an attacker to view the agent list without the necessary permissions (e.g., `admin`, `kibanauser`).\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Insufficient access control.\n*   Privilege escalation \u2013 ability to access information normally restricted to privileged users.\n*   CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nUnauthorized access to agent list information, including IDs, names, IPs, groups, OS details, and last keep-alive status.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Network-based attack.\n*   An attacker with a low-privileged account can send a specific POST request to `/api/request` with a crafted JSON body to retrieve the agent list.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   An attacker needs a low-privileged account on the Wazuh dashboard.\n*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the Wazuh dashboard.\n*   The attacker needs to know the correct request headers and JSON body format.\n*   The attacker needs to have a valid cookie for authentication.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   Upgrade to Wazuh dashboard version 4.9.1 or later.\n*   Ensure proper role-based access control is enforced for accessing sensitive information like the agent list.\n\n**CVSS v3 base metrics:**\n\n*   Attack Vector: Network (N)\n*   Attack Complexity: Low (L)\n*   Privileges Required: Low (L)\n*   User Interaction: Required (R)\n*   Scope: Unchanged (U)\n*   Confidentiality: Low (L)\n*   Integrity: Low (L)\n*   Availability: None (N)\n\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N",

Since the vulnerability description indicates **weak privilege access** allowing unauthorized viewing of the agent list, it suggests flawed authorization logic rather than a complete absence of authorization. Thus, CWE-863 is a more specific fit than its parent. Additionally, the retriever results also indicate that CWE-863 is a higher ranked candidate. The connection to CWE-269 (Improper Privilege Management) is considered, but it is a higher level Class and not as precise a fit as CWE-863.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe269[\"CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management\"]\n\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe269\n    \n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe269 secondary\n    class cwe285 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **weak privilege access** (the root cause). This leads to **incorrect authorization**, allowing an attacker to view the agent list. The impact is **privilege escalation**, as the attacker gains access to information they should not have.\n\n`Weak Privilege Access` -> `Incorrect Authorization (CWE-863)` -> `Privilege Escalation`\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe analysis focuses on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability, which is **weak privilege access**. The CVE description and the provided content summary both support this. The vulnerability allows an attacker to view the agent list without proper authorization. The retriever results also indicate that CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) is a strong candidate. The mapping guidance on Privileges vs Permissions suggests that given the flawed authorization logic, CWE-863 is a suitable match. Other CWEs like CWE-269 (Improper Privilege Management) are considered but deemed less specific. The decision is based on evidence from the vulnerability description, the retriever results, and the mapping guidance. The selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity, representing the flawed authorization logic that allows unauthorized access.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
