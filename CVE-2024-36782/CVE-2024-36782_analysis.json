This hierarchical relationship influenced the decision to choose the more specific CWE-259 over the more general CWE-798. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions a **hardcoded password**, making CWE-259 the most accurate and specific classification.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe259[\"CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password\"]\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    \n    cwe259 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe259 primary\n    class cwe798 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain consists of a single step: the presence of a **hardcoded password** leading to unauthorized root access.\n\n*   Root Cause: CWE-259 (Use of Hard-coded Password)\n*   Impact: Allows attackers to log in as root.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe analysis is based on the vulnerability description, which states that a **hardcoded password** exists in `/etc/shadow.sample`. The **rootcause** is the **hardcoded password**, which allows attackers to log in as root.\n\nThe Retriever Results also suggest CWE-259 as the top candidate.\n\nThe selection of CWE-259 is at the optimal level of specificity because it accurately describes the **rootcause** of the vulnerability, which is the use of a **hardcoded password**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context
