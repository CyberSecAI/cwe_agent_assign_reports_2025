  "description": "In the goTenna Pro App there is a vulnerability that makes it possible to inject any custom message with any GID and Callsign using a software defined radio in existing goTenna mesh networks. This vulnerability can be exploited if the device is being used in an unencrypted environment or if the cryptography has already been compromised. It is advised to share encryption keys via QR scanning for higher security operations and update your app to the current release for enhanced encryption protocols.",

This could lead to disruption of communication, misinformation, or other malicious activities.\n- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can use a software-defined radio to inject messages into the goTenna mesh network.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be within radio range of a goTenna mesh network and have the ability to send custom RF signals with a software-defined radio. The vulnerability can be exploited if the network is unencrypted or if the encryption is already compromised.",

The vulnerability description mentions **weak authentication** mechanisms as a root cause. The **Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm (CWE-327)** is a secondary concern given the mention of updating to current release for enhanced encryption protocols.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe327[\"CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe287 primary\n    class cwe327 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain starts with **weak authentication (CWE-287)**, potentially combined with a **risky cryptographic algorithm (CWE-327)**.

The suggestion to update the app for \"enhanced encryption protocols\" hints at a potential cryptographic issue, but the primary problem appears to be **weak authentication**.
