|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-287 | Improper Authentication [CWE Description: When an application does not adequately authenticate users, attackers can compromise the system by assuming the identity of legitimate users.] | 0.8 | Class | Primary | Allowed-with-Review |
| CWE-327 | Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm [CWE Description: The product uses a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm or protocol.] | 0.5 | Class | Secondary | Allowed-with-Review |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is **Improper Authentication (CWE-287)**, which is a class-level CWE. The vulnerability description mentions **weak authentication** mechanisms as a root cause. The **Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm (CWE-327)** is a secondary concern given the mention of updating to current release for enhanced encryption protocols.

## Vulnerability Chain
The chain starts with **weak authentication (CWE-287)**, potentially combined with a **risky cryptographic algorithm (CWE-327)**. This leads to the ability to **inject custom messages** into the goTenna mesh network, causing disruption and misinformation.

## Summary of Analysis
The primary assessment is based on the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which states "The goTenna Pro App has a **weakness** that allows for injection of custom messages with arbitrary GID and Callsign due to **weak authentication**." This clearly points to an authentication issue. The suggestion to update the app for "enhanced encryption protocols" hints at a potential cryptographic issue, but the primary problem appears to be **weak authentication**. I am selecting CWE-287 as the primary weakness and CWE-327 as the secondary weakness because of this evidence.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-941: Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product creates a communication channel to initiate an outgoing request to an actor, but it does not correctly specify the intended destination for that actor.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*   **Why Not Used**: While message injection is happening, this CWE is more focused on the communication channel specification rather than the authentication bypass.

## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*   **Why Not Used**: The description doesn't indicate cleartext transmission as the primary issue, but rather weak authentication.

## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*   **Why Not Used**: There is no evidence to support observable discrepancies.

## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate

*   **Why Not Used**: There is no evidence to suggest randomness issues.

## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate

*   **Why Not Used**: While related to authentication, CWE-287 is a better fit.

## CWE-290: Authentication Bypass by Spoofing
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.67
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
This attack-focused weakness is caused by incorrectly implemented authentication schemes that are subject to spoofing attacks.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*   **Why Not Used**: While an authentication bypass is occurring, it's not explicitly stated that it's through spoofing. CWE-287 is more general and accurate.

## CWE-346: Origin Validation Error
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.67
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly verify that the source of data or communication is valid.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

*   **Why Not Used**: Similar to CWE-345, but CWE-287 is a more direct and accurate fit.

## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.67
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

*   **Why Not Used**: There is no specific mention of weak credentials being used.

## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.67
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*   **Why Not Used**: This is too specific. The summary only states that there is weak authentication and doesn't mention issues with the authentication algorithm itself.

## CWE-294: Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.67
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A capture-replay flaw exists when the design of the product makes it possible for a malicious user to sniff network traffic and bypass authentication by replaying it to the server in question to the same effect as the original message (or with minor changes).

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*   **Why Not Used**: Too specific. The summary only states that there is weak authentication and doesn't mention capture-replay.

## CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 676.00
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The use of a hard-coded cryptographic key significantly increases the possibility that encrypted data may be recovered.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
