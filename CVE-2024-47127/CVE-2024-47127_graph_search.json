This vulnerability can be exploited if the device is being used in an unencrypted environment or if the cryptography has already been compromised. It is advised to share encryption keys via QR scanning for higher security operations and update your app to the current release for enhanced encryption protocols. Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-321 CWE-290 CWE-327 CWE-319 CWE-201 CWE-790 CWE-927 CWE-522 CWE-941",
