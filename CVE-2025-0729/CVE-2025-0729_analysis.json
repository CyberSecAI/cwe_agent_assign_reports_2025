  "description": "A vulnerability was found in TP-Link TL-SG108E 1.0.0 Build 20201208 Rel. 40304. It has been rated as problematic. This issue affects some unknown processing. The manipulation leads to **clickjacking**. The attack may be initiated remotely. Upgrading to version 1.0.0 Build 20250124 Rel. 54920(Beta) is able to address this issue. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component. The vendor was contacted early. They reacted very professional and provided a pre-fix version for their customers.",
