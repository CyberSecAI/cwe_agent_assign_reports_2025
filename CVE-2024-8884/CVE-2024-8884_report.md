## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary

| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-319 | Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information | 0.9 | Base | Primary CWE | Allowed |
| CWE-200 | Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor | 0.6 | Class | Secondary Candidate | Discouraged |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-319, which is a Base level CWE. CWE-319 is related to the impact, which is the exposure of sensitive information, represented by CWE-200. CWE-200 is a Class level CWE and is discouraged as it is high-level.

## Vulnerability Chain
The application transmits sensitive information in cleartext (CWE-319), leading to the exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized actor (CWE-200).

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment considered CWE-200 as a potential candidate since the Vulnerability Description stated "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor vulnerability exists that could cause exposure of credentials". However, after reviewing the "CVE Reference Links Content Summary", the root cause was determined to be that the "System Monitor application exposes sensitive information when accessed over HTTP" i.e. it's sending credentials in cleartext. Therefore, the primary CWE is CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information).

CWE-200 is still listed as a secondary candidate because it is the impact of the vulnerability. However, since the focus is to identify the root cause, CWE-319 is the more appropriate primary classification.

The selection of CWE-319 is at the optimal level of specificity because it accurately describes the **root cause** of the vulnerability, which is the cleartext transmission of sensitive information.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.80
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-213: Exposure of Sensitive Information Due to Incompatible Policies
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product's intended functionality exposes information to certain actors in accordance with the developer's security policy, but this information is regarded as sensitive according to the intended security policies of other stakeholders such as the product's administrator, users, or others whose information is being processed.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-200 is commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error. As of CWE 4.9, over 400 CWE entries can lead to a loss of confidentiality. Other options are often available. [REF-1287].



## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.



## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).



## CWE-202: Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Data Queries
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
When trying to keep information confidential, an attacker can often infer some of the information by using statistics.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 686.47
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-200 is commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error. As of CWE 4.9, over 400 CWE entries can lead to a loss of confidentiality. Other options are often available. [REF-1287].



## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 643.21
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access
