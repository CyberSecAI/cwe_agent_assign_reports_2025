## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability was found in Open Asset Import Library Assimp 5.4.3. It has been classified as critical. Affected is the function SceneCombinerMergeScenes of the file code/AssetLib/LWS/LWSLoader.cpp of the component LWS File Handler. The manipulation leads to **out-of-bounds read**. It is possible to launch the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **out-of-bounds read**
- **product:** Open Asset Import Library Assimp
- **version:** 5.4.3
- **component:** SceneCombinerMergeScenes in code/AssetLib/LWS/LWSLoader.cpp

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## CVE-2025-2753 Analysis

The provided content details a bug report (Issue #6014) for the assimp library, specifically an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. This directly relates to a potential security risk, and therefore is relevant to CVE analysis. The two provided snippets are identical.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from uninitialized memory allocation within the `Assimp::CopyPtrArray` function.  Memory is allocated for an array of pointers, but not initialized to zero. This can lead to the use of uninitialized variables, potentially pointing to arbitrary memory locations.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **CWE-457: Use of Uninitialized Variable:** This is the primary weakness.
*   **Out-of-bounds read:** The uninitialized memory can lead to reading data from memory outside the allocated bounds.

**Impact of exploitation:**

An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability to achieve remote code execution (RCE) by crafting a malicious LWS file.  The report suggests that writing a malicious address to the uninitialized memory before the read could allow control of the execution flow.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Malicious LWS file:** The primary attack vector is a specially crafted LWS (LWS format) file.  The `LWSLoader.cpp` file reads these files and triggers the vulnerable code path.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious LWS file to the victim's system, which will then be processed by assimp.
*   Knowledge of the assimp library's internal workings and memory layout would be beneficial for crafting a successful exploit.

**Mitigation or fix:**

The report does not explicitly state a fix, but the root cause indicates that initializing the allocated memory in `Assimp::CopyPtrArray` to zero would likely mitigate the vulnerability.

**Additional Details (compared to a hypothetical CVE description):**

The provided content offers significantly more detail than a typical CVE description would. It includes:

*   Specific file and function names (`code/AssetLib/LWS/LWSLoader.cpp:928`, `Assimp::SceneCombiner::CopySceneFlat`, `Assimp::CopyPtrArray`).
*   Code snippets illustrating the vulnerable code.
*   A detailed explanation of how the vulnerability can be triggered.
*   A proof-of-concept (PoC) including build instructions and a sample payload.
*   Sanitizer output confirming the vulnerability.
*   CWE mapping.
