## Vulnerability Description
A **command injection** vulnerability in the component /cgi-bin/qos.cgi of Wavlink WL-WN579A3 v1.0 allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands via a crafted input.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **command injection**
- **impact:** execute arbitrary commands
- **vector:** crafted input
- **attacker:** attackers
- **product:** Wavlink WL-WN579A3
- **version:** v1.0
- **component:** /cgi-bin/qos.cgi

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-44881 Content

The provided content **relates** to a remote command execution vulnerability in the `qos.cgi` script of the wavlink-WL-WN579A3 device. It provides significantly more detail than a standard CVE description would.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

A command injection vulnerability exists because the `qos.cgi` script executes a system function with a concatenated string (`byte_417C84`) that is controllable by the user through the `qos_bandwidth` parameter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Command Injection
*   Unsafe use of system() function

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Arbitrary command execution
*   Potential for information disclosure
*   Potential for system compromise

**Attack vectors:**

*   HTTP POST request to `./etc/lighttpd/www/cgi-bin/qos.cgi`
*   Specifically, manipulating the `qos_bandwidth` parameter.
*   Requires setting specific HTTP headers: `HTTP_REFERER=wifi.wavlink.com` and `HTTP_COOKIE=session=1111111111111`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   Network access to the device's web interface.
*   Ability to craft and send HTTP POST requests.
*   No authentication appears to be required beyond the cookie and referer header.

**Mitigation or fix:**

The content does not specify a fix, but implies that proper input validation and sanitization of the `qos_bandwidth` parameter before passing it to the `system()` function is necessary. Avoiding the use of `system()` altogether would be a more secure approach.

**Exploit Details:**

*   The exploit uses the `page=qos&sel_qos=1&qos_bandwidth=;ls;,1` payload.
*   The exploit is tested within a chrooted QEMU environment.
*   The resulting command executed is: `qos_script.sh mode_setup 1 ; ls; 1>/dev/null 2>&1`
