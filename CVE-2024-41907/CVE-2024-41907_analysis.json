The attacker needs to trick a user into interacting with malicious content.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need any specific privileges or authentication. The attacker must trick a user to interact with manipulated content. The vulnerability has a High attack complexity and requires User interaction to trigger the attack.",
