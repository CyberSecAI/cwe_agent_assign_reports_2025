# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-52813

## Vulnerability Description
matrix-rust-sdk is an implementation of a Matrix client-server library in Rust. Versions of the matrix-sdk-crypto Rust crate before 0.8.0 **lack a dedicated mechanism to notify that a users cryptographic identity has changed from a verified to an unverified one**, which could cause client applications relying on the SDK to overlook such changes. matrix-sdk-crypto 0.8.0 adds a new VerificationLevelVerificationViolation enum variant which indicates that a previously verified identity has been changed.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **lack a dedicated mechanism to notify that a users cryptographic identity has changed from a verified to an unverified one**
- **impact:** overlook such changes
- **product:** matrix-sdk-crypto Rust crate
- **version:** before 0.8.0

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
```text
Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information extracted from the provided content, focusing on CVE-2024-52813:

*   **Vulnerability:** Missing facility to signal rotation of a verified cryptographic identity.
*   **Affected Component:** matrix-sdk-crypto Rust crate
*   **Affected Versions:** Versions before 0.8.0
*   **Root Cause:** The affected versions lack a dedicated mechanism to notify that a user's cryptographic identity has changed from a verified to an unverified one, potentially causing client applications to overlook such changes.
*   **Impact:** Client applications relying on the SDK may overlook changes in a user's cryptographic identity.
