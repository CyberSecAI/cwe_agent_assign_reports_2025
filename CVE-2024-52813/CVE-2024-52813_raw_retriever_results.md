# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-52813
## Query
matrix-rust-sdk is an implementation of a Matrix client-server library in Rust. Versions of the matrix-sdk-crypto Rust crate before 0.8.0 lack a dedicated mechanism to notify that a users cryptographic identity has changed from a verified to an unverified one, which could cause client applications relying on the SDK to overlook such changes. matrix-sdk-crypto 0.8.0 adds a new VerificationLevelVerificationViolation enum variant which indicates that a previously verified identity has been changed.

## Keyphrases
- **weakness**: 'lack a dedicated mechanism to notify that a users cryptographic identity has changed from a verified to an unverified one'
