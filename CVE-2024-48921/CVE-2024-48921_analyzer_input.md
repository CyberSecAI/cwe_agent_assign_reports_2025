# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-48921

## Vulnerability Description
Kyverno is a policy engine designed for Kubernetes. A kyverno ClusterPolicy, ie. disallow-privileged-containers, can be overridden by the creation of a PolicyException in a random namespace. By design, **PolicyExceptions are consumed from any namespace**. Administrators may not recognize that this allows users with privileges to non-kyverno namespaces to create exceptions. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.13.0.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **PolicyExceptions are consumed from any namespace**
- **impact:** override Kyverno ClusterPolicy
- **attacker:** users with privileges to non-kyverno namespaces
- **product:** Kyverno
- **version:** before 1.13.0

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- Kyverno's `PolicyException` objects, designed to override `ClusterPolicy` enforcement, can be created in any namespace by default. This allows users with privileges in non-kyverno namespaces to bypass policies, even if those policies are meant to apply to resources in other namespaces.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Incorrect Access Control:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper access control regarding the creation of `PolicyException` objects. Specifically, any user with resource creation privileges in any namespace can create a `PolicyException` object that affects policies defined for other namespaces.
- **Bypass of Intended Policy Enforcement:** The vulnerability allows users to circumvent intended security policies set by administrators using `ClusterPolicy`, which are designed to enforce rules across the entire cluster.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker, by creating a `PolicyException`, can bypass a security policy, for example `disallow-privileged-containers` policy. This allows the attacker to create resources such as privileged containers which can then be used to escalate privileges to root on the node and potentially further compromise the cluster.
- **Compromised Security Posture:** The vulnerability weakens the overall security posture of the cluster by enabling bypass of security controls.
- **Undermining Policy Intent:**  Administrators may believe they are enforcing security across the cluster, but their policies can be overridden by less privileged users in unexpected ways.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector is adjacent, meaning the attacker needs to be on the same network as the Kubernetes cluster where Kyverno is running.
- The attacker must have the ability to create resources in a Kubernetes namespace.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Kubernetes User with Resource Creation Privileges:** An attacker needs to be a user who has permissions to create Kubernetes resources, specifically the `PolicyException` object, in any namespace of the cluster.
- **Knowledge of Kyverno Policies:** An attacker needs knowledge of the Kyverno `ClusterPolicy` they want to bypass, and how to configure a corresponding PolicyException to achieve this bypass.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided CVSS v4 metrics (AV:A/AC:H/AT:P/PR:H/UI:A/VC:H/VI:L/VA:L/SC:L/SI:H/SA:L) give a detailed view of the complexity and impact of this vulnerability.
-  The GitHub Security Advisory (GHSA-qjvc-p88j-j9rm) identifies the issue and indicates that versions of Kyverno prior to 1.13.0 are affected. Version 1.13.0 includes the fix.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* 🔍 *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* 🔍 *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion – CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### 🔸 CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ✅ *“A user created with the ‘guest’ role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ✅ *“The backup service runs as root but only needs read access.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ⚠️ This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### 🔸 CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ✅ *“User can access another user’s invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.”*

## Mapping Examples – Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *“User can escalate privileges to admin.”*
> ❌ Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged – only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ✅ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**

## Good Mapping Examples – Privileges & Permissions

* ✅ **CWE-266**: *“When a new user registers, the system assigns them admin role due to a missing role validation.”*
* ✅ **CWE-250**: *“Installer runs with system-level privileges but doesn't require them to install files in the user directory.”*
* ✅ **CWE-284**: *“Inconsistent access rules between UI and backend for sensitive endpoints.”*
* ✅ **CWE-285**: *“Authorization logic fails to restrict access to finance reports based on department.”*
