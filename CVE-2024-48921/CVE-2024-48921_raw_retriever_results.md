# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-48921
## Query
Kyverno is a policy engine designed for Kubernetes. A kyverno ClusterPolicy, ie. disallow-privileged-containers, can be overridden by the creation of a PolicyException in a random namespace. By design, PolicyExceptions are consumed from any namespace. Administrators may not recognize that this allows users with privileges to non-kyverno namespaces to create exceptions. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.13.0.

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: 'PolicyExceptions are consumed from any namespace'
