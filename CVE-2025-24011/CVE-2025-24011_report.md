# Analysis Report for CVE-2025-24011

# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2025-24011

## Description

Umbraco is a free and open source .NET content management system. Starting in version 14.0.0 and prior to versions 14.3.2 and 15.1.2, its possible to determine whether an account exists based on an analysis of response codes and timing of Umbraco management API responses. Versions 14.3.2 and 15.1.2 contain a patch. No known workarounds are available.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Impact:** determine whether an account exists
- **Product:** Umbraco management API
- **Version:** Starting in version 14.0.0 and prior to versions 14.3.2 and 15.1.2

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-204 | Observable Response Discrepancy | 0.8 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE. The vulnerability allows an attacker to determine if an account exists based on response codes and timing. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE selected, CWE-204, stands alone in this case. There are no direct parent-child, chain, or peer relationships that significantly influence the mapping decision, as the vulnerability is fairly specific to the observable discrepancy in response behavior. The abstraction level is base, which is the preferred level.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain is relatively simple:

1.  **Root Cause:** The system exhibits **observable response discrepancy** (CWE-204) based on the existence of an account.
2.  **Impact:** An attacker can determine whether an account exists.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis and the retriever results pointed towards authorization and authentication bypasses. However, a closer reading of the vulnerability description reveals that the core issue is the ability to determine the existence of an account based on the analysis of response codes and timing. This aligns directly with CWE-204, Observable Response Discrepancy.

The evidence supporting this decision comes directly from the vulnerability description: "its possible to determine whether an account exists based on an analysis of response codes and timing of Umbraco management API responses."

The selection of CWE-204 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the observable discrepancy that allows user enumeration. Other CWEs like those related to authorization bypass were considered but deemed less relevant because the vulnerability does not directly bypass authorization; rather, it allows an attacker to infer information about user accounts.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
