# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2025-37941
## Query
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ASoC codecs wcd937x fix a potential memory leak in wcd937x_soc_codec_probe() When snd_soc_dapm_new_controls() or snd_soc_dapm_add_routes() fails, wcd937x_soc_codec_probe() returns without releasing wcd937x->clsh_info, which is allocated by wcd_clsh_ctrl_alloc. Add wcd_clsh_ctrl_free() to prevent potential memory leak.

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: 'wcd937x->clsh_info is not freed'
