## Vulnerability Description
Swissphone DiCal-RED 4009 devices allow a remote attacker to gain access to the administrative web interface via the device passwords hash value, without knowing the actual device password.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** gain access to administrative web interface
- **vector:** device passwords hash value
- **attacker:** remote attacker
- **product:** Swissphone DiCal-RED 4009

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-36439:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The DiCal-RED device uses the MD5 hash of the password instead of the actual password for authentication to its administrative web interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-836 (Use of Password Hash Instead of Password for Authentication):** The core issue is that the system accepts the password hash as a valid credential, rather than using it to verify a password.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker who obtains the password hash (e.g., through a previous compromise or other means) can bypass the authentication mechanism and gain full access to the administrative web interface.
*   **Full Control:** Access to the administrative interface provides full control over the device and its functions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by intercepting or manipulating HTTP requests to the device's web interface.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle:** An attacker could intercept a legitimate login attempt and obtain the password hash, or simply use a known hash.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to communicate with the device's web interface, either locally or remotely.
*   **Hash Knowledge:** The attacker must know the MD5 hash of the valid administrative password, which could be obtained through other attacks, or may already be known if default credentials are not changed.
*   **Request Manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify HTTP requests. This can be achieved using a local proxy or browser plugin.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vendor has stated that the device is EOL (End of Life) and will not provide a fix.
*   The advisory mentions that the device runs a Linux and BusyBox based operating system.
*   The manufacturer's suggested solution is to not run the device in an untrusted network, which is not a full mitigation.
