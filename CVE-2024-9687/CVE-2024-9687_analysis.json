  "description": "The WP 2FA with Telegram plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Authentication Bypass in versions up to, and including, 3.0. This is due to **insufficient validation of the user-controlled key** on the validate_tg action. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-9687:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of a user-controlled key within the 'validate\\_tg' action of the WP 2FA with Telegram plugin. This lack of proper validation allows attackers to bypass the authentication process.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **Authentication Bypass:** The primary weakness is the ability to bypass the intended two-factor authentication, effectively allowing unauthorized access to user accounts.\n*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The plugin fails to properly validate the authentication code submitted by the user. Specifically, it does not check if the code matches the expected value, allowing an attacker to submit a manipulated code.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   **Account Takeover:** Successful exploitation enables attackers to log in as any existing user on the WordPress site, including administrator accounts. This can lead to complete site compromise and data breaches.\n*   **Full Site Control:** By gaining administrator access, attackers can modify site content, install malicious plugins or themes, delete data, redirect users, or otherwise compromise the website and its users.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   **Network Access:** The vulnerability is exploited remotely over the network.\n*   **Direct Request:** Attackers send a crafted request to the `wp-login.php?action=validate_tg` endpoint. This request contains a manipulated value for the `authcode` parameter, and a valid `wp-auth-id` corresponding to the target user.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   **Authenticated User:** Attackers need to have an existing account on the WordPress site with at least subscriber-level permissions. This is required to access the vulnerable `validate_tg` action.\n*   **Knowledge of Target User ID:** Attackers need to know the numerical ID of the user they want to impersonate, typically an administrator.\n*   **Ability to send HTTP requests:** The attacker must be capable of sending HTTP requests to the WordPress site.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n* The vulnerability is located in the `validate_tg()` function within `class-wp-factor-telegram-plugin.php`.\n* The vulnerable code is specifically within the check `if ( true !== $this->is_valid_authcode( $_REQUEST['authcode'] ) )`. This check uses a cookie but doesn't validate the code against any user-specific token, allowing a malicious actor to forge their own authentication code.\n* The plugin sets a cookie with a hashed authcode, but does not properly validate the authcode against the user being authenticated.\n* The fix involves updating to version 3.1 of the plugin which addresses the insufficient validation.",

The vulnerability allows bypassing authentication due to **insufficient validation of the user-controlled key**. While CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) and CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) were considered, the evidence points towards a more specific issue of using a user-controlled key to bypass authorization, making CWE-639 more appropriate. CWE-472 (External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter) was also considered since the key is externally controlled, but CWE-639 is a better fit as it focuses on the authorization bypass aspect.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe472[\"CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\"]\n    \n    cwe639 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe639 -->|CHILDOF| cwe863\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe639 primary\n    class cwe284,cwe863,cwe306,cwe862,cwe472 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **insufficient validation of the user-controlled key** (CWE-639), leading to an **authentication bypass**, allowing attackers to log in as any user.\n\nRoot Cause: **Insufficient validation of the user-controlled key** (CWE-639)\nImpact: Authentication Bypass, Account Takeover\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe primary CWE selected is CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key) due to the **insufficient validation of a user-controlled key**.
