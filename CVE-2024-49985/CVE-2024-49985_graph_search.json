This is because the clock controller first grabs the prepare_lock mutex and then performs the prepare operation, including its I2C access. The I2C access resumes this I2C bus controller via .runtime_resume callback, which calls clk_prepare_enable(), which attempts to grab the prepare_lock mutex again and deadlocks. Since the clock are already prepared since probe() and unprepared in remove(), use simple clk_enable()/clk_disable() calls to enable and disable the clock on runtime suspend and resume, to avoid hitting the prepare_lock mutex.
