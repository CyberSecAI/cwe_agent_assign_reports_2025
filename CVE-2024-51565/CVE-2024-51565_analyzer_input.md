# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-51565

## Vulnerability Description
The hda driver is vulnerable to a **buffer over-read** from a guest-controlled value.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **buffer over-read**
- **component:** hda driver

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2024-51565:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The hda (High Definition Audio) driver in the bhyve hypervisor is vulnerable to a buffer over-read.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Over-read:** The vulnerability stems from the hda driver reading beyond the allocated buffer boundaries. This is triggered by a value controlled by the guest operating system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A malicious guest VM can potentially cause a denial of service of the bhyve host.
*   **Memory Disclosure:**  A malicious guest VM can potentially read memory within the bhyve process that it should not be able to access.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Guest-Controlled Value:** The vulnerability is triggered by a guest operating system providing specific, malicious values to the hda driver.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Malicious Guest VM:** The attacker needs to be able to run a guest virtual machine within the bhyve hypervisor.
*   **HDA Device Access:** The guest VM needs access to the emulated HDA device.

**Summary of the Issue:**
CVE-2024-51565 is a buffer over-read vulnerability in the bhyve hypervisor's HDA audio driver. A malicious guest VM, by providing crafted input to the hda driver, could cause the hypervisor to read past the end of a buffer, leading to a denial-of-service on the host or information disclosure through memory access.
