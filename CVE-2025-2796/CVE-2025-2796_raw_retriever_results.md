# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2025-2796
## Query
On affected platforms with hardware IPSec support running Arista EOS with IPsec enabled and anti-replay protection configured, EOS may exhibit unexpected behavior in specific cases. Received duplicate encrypted packets, which should be dropped under normal anti-replay protection, will instead be forwarded due to this vulnerability. Note this issue does not affect VXLANSec or MACSec encryption functionality.
