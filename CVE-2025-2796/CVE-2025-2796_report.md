# Analysis Report for CVE-2025-2796

# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2025-2796

## Description

On affected platforms with hardware IPSec support running Arista EOS with IPsec enabled and anti-replay protection configured, EOS may exhibit unexpected behavior in specific cases. Received duplicate encrypted packets, which should be dropped under normal anti-replay protection, will instead be forwarded due to this vulnerability. Note this issue does not affect VXLANSec or MACSec encryption functionality.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Rootcause:** weakness
- **Impact:** ['forward duplicate encrypted packets', 'unexpected behavior']
- **Product:** Arista EOS
- **Component:** IPsec

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-294 | Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay | 0.75 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE: The vulnerability involves the forwarding of duplicate encrypted packets, which bypasses the intended anti-replay protection mechanism. This aligns with the concept of capturing and replaying network traffic to bypass authentication. |
| CWE-284 | Improper Access Control | 0.6 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary Candidate: The advisory mentions "Improper Access Control" as a weakness. While not explicitly detailed, the ability to forward duplicate packets suggests a **failure in access control** mechanisms related to replay protection. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-294 (Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay), which is a Base level CWE. While the vulnerability description focuses on the forwarding of duplicate encrypted packets, the underlying issue is the bypass of the anti-replay protection mechanism. This mechanism is meant to prevent the successful replay of captured network traffic.

CWE-294 is related to CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) because the anti-replay protection is a form of access control. However, CWE-294 is more specific, as it pinpoints the vulnerability to capture-replay attacks.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain is as follows:
1.  **Root Cause:** **Weakness** in anti-replay protection.
2.  **Impact:** Forwarding of duplicate encrypted packets.
3.  **Result:** Unexpected behavior and potential security issues.

CWE-294 represents the root cause, while the forwarding of packets is a direct consequence. The potential security issues are further impacts.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and the analysis of CVE-2025-2796 content. The core issue is that duplicate encrypted packets, which should be dropped by the anti-replay protection mechanism, are instead forwarded. This bypasses the intended security control, which aligns with CWE-294 (Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay).

The analysis of CVE-2025-2796 content indicates that the vulnerability leads to an Improper Access Control (CWE-284).

The retriever results also suggest CWE-294 as a potential candidate, further supporting the selection.

The selection of CWE-294 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the capture-replay aspect of the vulnerability. While CWE-284 is also relevant, it is a broader category and doesn't capture the specific nature of the bypass.

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-294: Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A capture-replay flaw exists when the design of the product makes it possible for a malicious user to sniff network traffic and bypass authentication by replaying it to the server in question to the same effect as the original message (or with minor changes).

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
