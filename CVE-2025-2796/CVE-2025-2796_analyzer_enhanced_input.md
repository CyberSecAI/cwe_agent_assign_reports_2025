## Vulnerability Description
On affected platforms with hardware IPSec support running Arista EOS with IPsec enabled and anti-replay protection configured, EOS may exhibit unexpected behavior in specific cases. Received duplicate encrypted packets, which should be dropped under normal anti-replay protection, will instead be forwarded due to this vulnerability. Note this issue does not affect VXLANSec or MACSec encryption functionality.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **weakness**
- **impact:** forward duplicate encrypted packets and unexpected behavior
- **product:** Arista EOS
- **component:** IPsec

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-2796 Content

This content is **RELEVANT** to CVE-2025-2796. It is a security advisory from Arista Networks detailing the vulnerability. Here's a breakdown of the information extracted:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   Received duplicate encrypted packets, which should be dropped under normal anti-replay protection, will instead be forwarded due to this vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Improper Access Control (CWE-284)

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   The advisory states that the vulnerability allows forwarding of duplicate encrypted packets that should have been dropped. The impact isn't explicitly stated as leading to data breaches or service disruption, but the forwarding of duplicate packets could potentially lead to unexpected behavior or security issues.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered by receiving duplicate encrypted packets when hardware IPSec with anti-replay protection is enabled.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to send duplicate encrypted packets to the affected system. The advisory does not specify if this requires a privileged position.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   Upgrade to EOS versions 4.33.3F or later in the 4.33.x train.
*   There is no known mitigation other than upgrading. No hotfix is available.

**Affected Software:**

*   EOS Versions 4.34.0F and 4.33.2F and below releases in the 4.33.x train

**Affected Platforms:**

*   Specific 7280R3 and 7800R3 Series products are listed. A comprehensive list of affected and unaffected products is provided in the advisory.

**Required Configuration for Exploitation:**

*   **anti-replay detection** must be configured in IPSec SA Policy.

**Indicators of Compromise:**

*   No practical ways exist to determine if the system has been compromised.

**Note:** This content provides significantly more detail than the placeholder CVE description. It includes affected products, specific configurations required for exploitation, and detailed mitigation steps.
