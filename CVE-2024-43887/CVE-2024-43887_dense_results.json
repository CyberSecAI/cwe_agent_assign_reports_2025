  "query": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved net/tcp Disable TCP-AO static key after RCU grace period The lifetime of TCP-AO static_key is the same as the last tcp_ao_info. On the socket destruction tcp_ao_info ceases to be with RCU grace period, while tcp-ao static branch is currently deferred destructed. The static key definition is DEFINE_STATIC_KEY_DEFERRED_FALSE(tcp_ao_needed, HZ) which means that if RCU grace period is delayed by more than a second and tcp_ao_needed is in the process of disablement, other CPUs may yet see tcp_ao_info which atent dead, but soon-to-be. And that breaks the assumption of static_key_fast_inc_not_disabled(). See the comment near the definition > * The caller must make sure that the static key cant get disabled while > * in this function. It doesnt patch jump labels, only adds a user to > * an already enabled static key. Originally it was introduced in commit eb8c507296f6 (jump_label Prevent key->enabled int overflow), which is needed for the atomic contexts, one of which would be the creation of a full socket from a request socket. In that atomic context, its known by the presence of the key (md5/ao) that the static branch is already enabled. So, the ref counter for that static branch is just incremented instead of holding the proper mutex. static_key_fast_inc_not_disabled() is just a helper for such usage case. But it must not be used if the static branch could get disabled in parallel as its not prote",
