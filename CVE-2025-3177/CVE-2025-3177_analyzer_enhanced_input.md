## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-3177 Content

Based on the provided content, this relates to a vulnerability in Fastcms v0.1.5.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause is JWT hard coding within the Fastcms application. A default JWT key is used, allowing attackers to forge identity tokens.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   JWT hard coding
*   Identity forgery

**Impact of exploitation:**

Successful exploitation allows attackers to forge identity tokens, potentially gaining unauthorized access or performing actions as legitimate users.

**Attack vectors:**

*   An attacker can use the hardcoded JWT key to create valid tokens.
*   The provided example shows a GET request with a crafted Authorization header.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to know the hardcoded JWT key.
*   No specific position is required, as the vulnerability can be exploited remotely.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   Do not use the default JWT key.
*   Implement a mechanism to add the JWT key as a startup parameter when starting the project.

**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**

*   The affected product is Fastcms v0.1.5.
*   The vendor is identified as <https://www.xjd2020.com/> and the code repositories are provided.
*   The issue report includes screenshots demonstrating the JWT construction and the request example.
*   The vulnerability was reported by cds.
*   The issue was opened on March 27, 2025.
