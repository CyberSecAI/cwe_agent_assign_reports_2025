    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'Improper Input Validation'

Relevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:

### 1. CWE-20: Improper Input Validation (Score: 254.85)

The product receives input or data, but it does
        not validate or incorrectly validates that the input has the
        properties that are required to process the data safely and
        correctly....

### 2. CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input (Score: 237.91)

The product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties....

### 3. CWE-1286: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input (Score: 237.76)

The product receives input that is expected to be well-formed - i.e., to comply with a certain syntax - but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input complies with the syntax....

### 4. CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer (Score: 233.69)

The product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data....

### 5. CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation (Score: 230.38)

The product does not validate, or incorrectly validates, a certificate....
