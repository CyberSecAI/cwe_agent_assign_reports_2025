## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved posix-clock Fix **missing timespec64 check** in pc_clock_settime() As Andrew pointed out, it will make sense that the PTP core checked timespec64 structs tv_sec and tv_nsec range before calling ptp->info->settime64(). As the man manual of clock_settime() said, if tp.tv_sec is negative or tp.tv_nsec is outside the range [0..999,999,999], it should return EINVAL, which include dynamic clocks which handles PTP clock, and the condition is consistent with timespec64_valid(). As Thomas suggested, timespec64_valid() only check the timespec is valid, but not ensure that the time is in a valid range, so check it ahead using timespec64_valid_strict() in pc_clock_settime() and return -EINVAL if not valid. There are some drivers that use tp->tv_sec and tp->tv_nsec directly to write registers without validity checks and assume that the higher layer has checked it, which is dangerous and will benefit from this, such as hclge_ptp_settime(), igb_ptp_settime_i210(), _rcar_gen4_ptp_settime(), and some drivers can remove the checks of itself.

- **product:** Linux kernel
- **component:** pc_clock_settime()

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of this vulnerability is the missing validation of `timespec64` structures in the `pc_clock_settime()` function within the Linux kernel's posix-clock subsystem. Specifically, the `tv_sec` and `tv_nsec` fields of the timespec64 struct were not being checked for valid ranges before being passed to lower-level PTP (Precision Time Protocol) drivers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The `pc_clock_settime` function was not performing adequate checks on the `timespec64` structure before using it. This allowed for potentially invalid or out-of-range time values to be passed down to the hardware.
- **Reliance on Higher Layer Checks:** Some PTP drivers were directly using the `tv_sec` and `tv_nsec` values to write to hardware registers without validating them, assuming the higher layers had already done this validation.
- **Incorrect use of `timespec64_valid()`**: The `timespec64_valid()` function only checks if the timespec is a valid struct, not whether the values it holds are within valid ranges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Undefined Behavior:** By providing an invalid `timespec64` structure, an attacker could cause undefined behavior by writing out-of-range values to hardware registers directly. This could potentially lead to unexpected system behavior.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited via the `clock_settime()` syscall, which allows a user to set a system-wide clock. If a dynamic clock using PTP is set by the user, then they can control the timespec passed to it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **User Privileges:** An attacker would need to have sufficient privileges to call the `clock_settime()` syscall, which is typically available to most users.
- **Target System:** The system must be using a dynamic clock utilizing PTP (Precision Time Protocol) and have a vulnerable driver.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix involves adding a call to `timespec64_valid_strict()` in `pc_clock_settime()` which returns an error if the timespec has invalid values.
- The vulnerability exists because some drivers assume the higher layer performs the check, and it did not.
- The fix will allow some drivers to remove their own checks.
