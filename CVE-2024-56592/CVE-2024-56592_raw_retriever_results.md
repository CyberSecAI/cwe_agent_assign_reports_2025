## Query
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved bpf Call free_htab_elem() after htab_unlock_bucket() For htab of maps, when the map is removed from the htab, it may hold the last reference of the map. bpf_map_fd_put_ptr() will invoke bpf_map_free_id() to free the id of the removed map element. However, bpf_map_fd_put_ptr() is invoked while holding a bucket lock (raw_spin_lock_t), and bpf_map_free_id() attempts to acquire map_idr_lock (spinlock_t), triggering the following lockdep warning ============================= [ BUG Invalid wait context ] 6.11.0-rc4+ #49 Not tainted ----------------------------- test_maps/4881 is trying to lock ffffffff84884578 (map_idr_lock){+...}-{33}, at bpf_map_free_id.part.0+0x21/0x70 other info that might help us debug this context-{55} 2 locks held by test_maps/4881 #0 ffffffff846caf60 (rcu_read_lock){....}-{13}, at bpf_fd_htab_map_update_elem+0xf9/0x270 #1 ffff888149ced148 (&htab->lockdep_key#2){....}-{22}, at htab_map_update_elem+0x178/0xa80 stack backtrace CPU 0 UID 0 PID 4881 Comm test_maps Not tainted 6.11.0-rc4+ #49 Hardware name QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), ...

However, bpf_map_alloc_id() invokes idr_alloc_cyclic() after acquiring map_idr_lock, it will trigger a similar lockdep warning because the slabs lock (s->cpu_slab->lock) is still a spinlock. Instead of changing map_idr_locks type, fix the issue by invoking htab_put_fd_value() after htab_unlock_bucket(). However, only deferring the invocation of htab_put_fd_value() is not enough, because the old map pointers in htab of maps can not be saved during batched deletion. Therefore, also defer the invocation of free_htab_elem(), so these to-be-freed elements could be linked together similar to lru map. There are four callers for ->map_fd_put_ptr (1) alloc_htab_elem() (through htab_put_fd_value()) It invokes ->map_fd_put_ptr() under a raw_spinlock_t. The invocation of htab_put_fd_value() can not simply move after htab_unlock_bucket(), because the old element has already been stashed in htab->extra_elems. It may be reused immediately after htab_unlock_bucket() and the invocation of htab_put_fd_value() after htab_unlock_bucket() may release the newly-added element incorrectly. Therefore, saving the map pointer of the old element for htab of maps before unlocking the bucket and releasing the map_ptr after unlock. Beside the map pointer in the old element, should do the same thing for the special fields in the old element as well. (2) free_htab_elem() (through htab_put_fd_value()) Its caller includes __htab_map_lookup_and_delete_elem(), htab_map_delete_elem() and __htab_map_lookup_and_delete_batch(). For htab_map_delete_elem(), simply invoke free_htab_elem() after htab_unlock_bucket(). For __htab_map_lookup_and_delete_batch(), just like lru map, linking the to-be-freed element into node_to_free list and invoking free_htab_elem() for these element after unlock. It is safe to reuse batch_flink as the link for node_to_free, because these elements have been removed from the hash llist. Because htab of maps doesnt support lookup_and_delete operation, __htab_map_lookup_and_delete_elem() doesnt have the problem, so kept it as ---truncated---
