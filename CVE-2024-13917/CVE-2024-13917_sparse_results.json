  "query": "An application com.pri.applock, which is pre-loaded on Kruger&Matz smartphones, allows a user to encrypt any application using user-provided PIN code or by using biometric data. Exposed com.pri.applock.LockUI activity allows any other malicious application, with no granted Android system permissions, to inject an arbitrary intent with system-level privileges to a protected application. One must know the protecting PIN number (it might be revealed by exploiting CVE-2024-13916) or ask the user to provide it. Only version (version name 13, version code 33) was tested and confirmed to have this vulnerability. Application update was released in April 2025.",
