Exposed com.pri.applock.LockUI activity allows any other malicious application, with no granted Android system permissions, to inject an arbitrary intent with system-level privileges to a protected application. One must know the protecting PIN number (it might be revealed by exploiting CVE-2024-13916) or ask the user to provide it. Only version (version name 13, version code 33) was tested and confirmed to have this vulnerability. Application update was released in April 2025.",

The relationship indicates that an authorization issue stems from the improper exposure of an Android application component. The secondary candidate CWE-863 is a Class-level CWE, representing a more general form of authorization failure. Selecting the variant CWE-926 provides more specific context to the Android application environment.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe926[\"CWE-926: Improper Export of Android Application Components\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe926 -->|CHILDOF| cwe863\n    cwe926 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe926 primary\n    class cwe863,cwe285 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper export of an Android application component** (CWE-926). This leads to an **incorrect authorization** (CWE-863) where a malicious application can inject an arbitrary intent with system-level privileges to a protected application. The impact is the ability to bypass intended security restrictions and gain elevated privileges.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary assessment is based on the provided CVE description and the associated \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary.\" The evidence strongly supports the classification of **CWE-926 (Improper Export of Android Application Components)** as the root cause. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions that the exposed \"com.pri.applock.LockUI\" activity allows a malicious application to inject an arbitrary intent with system-level privileges.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the decision to choose CWE-926, as it is a variant of the broader CWE-863 and CWE-285. This variant provides a more accurate and specific representation of the vulnerability within the context of Android applications.\n\nThe selection of CWE-926 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the improper export of an Android application component. This is more specific than the more general authorization issues represented by CWE-863 and CWE-285.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-451: User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe user interface (UI) does not properly represent critical information to the user, allowing the information - or its source - to be obscured or spoofed.
