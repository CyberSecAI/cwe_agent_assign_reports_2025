CWE-311 is a higher-level Class and is considered as the credentials were encrypted but the encryption was not properly handled.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe532[\"CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File\"]\n    cwe311[\"CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\"]\n    \n    cwe532\n    cwe311\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe532 primary\n    class cwe311 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the GlobalProtect app's **improper handling of encrypted user credentials**, leading to the **insertion of these credentials into log files**, which results in the **exposure of sensitive information**.\n  - **Root Cause**: Improper handling of encrypted credentials leading to unintentional logging (CWE-532)\n  - **Impact**: Exposure of user credentials, potential compromise of user accounts.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-532 because the vulnerability description and CVE reference links clearly indicate that the root cause is the **insertion of sensitive information into log files**. The application logs, which are normally only viewable by local users, contain encrypted user credentials due to improper handling by the GlobalProtect app. The evidence from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary states: \"Root cause of vulnerability: The Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app improperly handles encrypted user credentials, including username and password, and writes them to application log files (PanGPA.log), where they can be exposed.\"\n\nCWE-311 was considered because the credentials were encrypted, but the **missing encryption** aspect is not the root cause; it's the logging of the encrypted credentials that is the core issue. The evidence suggests the problem is not the lack of encryption, but the exposure of already encrypted data.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product writes sensitive information to a log file.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
