The initial approach to work around of this problem was to queue another work item per neighbor and then run this in a new context.

But the code in the ELP metric worker also tries to use rtnl_lock() - which will never return in this case. This also means that cancel_work_sync would never return because it is waiting for the worker to finish. * iterating over the neighbor list for the to-be-deactivated interface is currently done using the RCU specific methods. Which means that it is possible to miss items when iterating over it without the associated spinlock - a behaviour which is acceptable for a periodic metric check but not for a cleanup routine (which must stop all still running workers) The better approch is to get rid of the per interface neighbor metric worker and handle everything in the interface worker. The original problems are solved by * creating a list of neighbors which require new metric information inside the RCU protected context, gathering the metric according to the new list outside the RCU protected context * only use rcu_trylock inside metric gathering code to avoid a deadlock when the cancel_delayed_work_sync is called in the interface removal code (which is called with the rtnl_lock held)",
