However, XSS vulnerabilities typically allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.\\n\\n**Attack Vectors:**\\n*   The attack vector is through web pages served by the Micro Focus Access Manager. The attacker injects malicious scripts that are then executed in the victim\\'s browser.\\n\\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\\n*   An attacker needs the ability to inject malicious scripts into a web page served by Micro Focus Access Manager. This typically involves finding input fields or other areas where user-controlled data is not properly sanitized.\\n\\n**Additional Notes:**\\n*   The release notes mention that this vulnerability is resolved in Access Manager 5.0 Service Pack 4 Patch 1 and Access Manager 5.1 (24.2).\\n*   The provided text does not specify the location or type of the XSS vulnerabilities and only references an external KB article for more information.', similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {}, 'top_cwes_by_threshold': {}}}, similarity_summary=SimilarityInsight(consensus_cwe='', top_cwes=[], confidence_levels={}, total_samples=0), analysis='', analysis_with_relationships='', criticism='', resolution='', relevant_cwes=[{'metadata': {'doc_id': '79', 'name': \"Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\", 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'rootcause:Improper Input Validation', 'keyphrase': 'Improper Input Validation', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'rootcause:Input Validation vulnerability', 'keyphrase': 'Input Validation vulnerability', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'weakness:Cross-Site Scripting', 'keyphrase': 'Cross-Site Scripting', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'impact:Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)', 'keyphrase': 'Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)', 'type': 'impact'}, {'id': 'product:OpenText NetIQ Access Manager', 'keyphrase': 'OpenText NetIQ Access Manager', 'type': 'product'}, {'id': 'version:before 5.0.4.1 and 5.1', 'keyphrase': 'before 5.0.4.1 and 5.1', 'type': 'version'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(205.24962448980511)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '80', 'name': 'Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'rootcause:Improper Input Validation', 'keyphrase': 'Improper Input Validation', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'rootcause:Input Validation vulnerability', 'keyphrase': 'Input Validation vulnerability', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'weakness:Cross-Site Scripting', 'keyphrase': 'Cross-Site Scripting', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'impact:Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)', 'keyphrase': 'Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)', 'type': 'impact'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(190.174534979829)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '116', 'name': 'Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
