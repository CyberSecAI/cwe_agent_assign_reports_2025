  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved dm thin make get_first_thin use rcu-safe list first function The documentation in rculist.h explains the absence of list_empty_rcu() and cautions programmers against relying on a list_empty() -> list_first() sequence in RCU safe code. This is because each of these functions performs its own READ_ONCE() of the list head. This can lead to a situation where the list_empty() sees a valid list entry, but the subsequent list_first() sees a different view of list head state after a modification. In the case of dm-thin, this author had a production box crash from a GP fault in the process_deferred_bios path. This function saw a valid list head in get_first_thin() but when it subsequently dereferenced that and turned it into a thin_c, it got the inside of the struct pool, since the list was now empty and referring to itself. The kernel on which this occurred printed both a warning about a refcount_t being saturated, and a UBSAN error for an out-of-bounds cpuid access in the queued spinlock, prior to the fault itself. When the resulting kdump was examined, it was possible to see another thread patiently waiting in thin_dtrs synchronize_rcu. The thin_dtr call managed to pull the thin_c out of the active thins list (and have it be the last entry in the active_thins list) at just the wrong moment which lead to this crash. Fortunately, the fix here is straight forward. Switch get_first_thin() function to use list_first_or_null_rcu() which performs just a single READ_ONCE() and returns NULL if the list is already empty. This was run against the devicemapper test suites thin-provisioning suites for delete and suspend and no regressions were observed.",

CWE-362 can lead to a CWE-476 if a shared resource is accessed when it is NULL. This makes CWE-476 a secondary candidate.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    cwe476[\"CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference\"]\n    cwe362 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe476\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe362 primary\n    class cwe476 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **race condition** (CWE-362) where a thread removes an item from a list at the wrong moment. Because the READ_ONCE() calls in `list_empty()` and `list_first()` are separate, a race condition can cause `list_empty()` to return true while `list_first()` then attempts to dereference a pointer that is no longer valid, leading to a **NULL pointer dereference** (CWE-476) and a crash.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-362 as the primary weakness due to the **race condition** described in the vulnerability. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions a timing issue where a thread removes an element from the list at the wrong moment, leading to subsequent issues. CWE-476 is added as a secondary concern because the **race condition** can lead to a **NULL pointer dereference**, as the code may attempt to access a resource that has been removed from the list.\n\nEvidence: \"This can lead to a situation where the list_empty() sees a valid list entry, but the subsequent list_first() sees a different view of list head state after a modification...The thin_dtr call managed to pull the thin_c out of the active thins list (and have it be the last entry in the active_thins list) at just the wrong moment which lead to this crash.\"\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the final selection by highlighting the potential chain of events, where CWE-362 can lead to CWE-476.
