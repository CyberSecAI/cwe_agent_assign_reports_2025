# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-6166

## Vulnerability Description
The Unlimited Elements For Elementor (Free Widgets, Addons, Templates) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to **time-based SQL Injection** via the addons_order parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.5.112 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above and granted plugin setting edit permissions by an administrator, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**
- **weakness:** **time-based SQL Injection**
- **impact:** extract sensitive information from the database
- **attacker:** authenticated attackers with Contributor-level access and above
- **product:** Unlimited Elements For Elementor (Free Widgets and Addons and Templates) plugin for WordPress
- **version:** up to and including 1.5.112
- **component:** addons_order parameter

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-6166:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

   - The provided content, especially from Wordfence, explicitly states that the vulnerability is related to **"Unlimited Elements For Elementor (Free Widgets, Addons, Templates) <= 1.5.112 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Time-Based SQL Injection"**, which aligns with the CVE description.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

   - **Insufficient input sanitization/escaping:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize/escape user-supplied input, specifically the `addons_order` parameter.
   - **Lack of Prepared Statements:** The SQL query is not properly prepared, allowing for the injection of malicious SQL code.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

   - **Time-based SQL Injection:** The vulnerability is a time-based SQL injection, meaning an attacker can use time delays to infer information from the database by injecting malicious queries that cause delays.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

   - **Sensitive Data Extraction:** An attacker can potentially extract sensitive information from the database by injecting SQL queries that are designed to retrieve data.
   - **Full Database Access:** In some cases, SQL injection can lead to full access to the database.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

   - The vulnerability is exposed through the `addons_order` parameter.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

   - **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the WordPress site with at least **Contributor-level** access or higher.
  - **Plugin edit permission:**  The attacker needs to have been granted the permission to edit plugin settings by an administrator.

**Additional Details:**

- The provided Trac changelog (3112307) and the Wordfence article indicates the vulnerability was fixed in version **1.5.113** of the plugin. The changelog mentions "fixed some small security issues found by wordfence".
- The vulnerability is located in the file: `unlimited-elements-for-elementor/trunk/inc_php/unitecreator_addons.class.php#L79`. The vulnerable code appears to be related to how addon orders are handled.
- The Wordfence article provides a CVSS score of 8.8 which is high, as well as details about the affected versions and where the patch is located.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* 🔍 *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* 🔍 *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion – CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### 🔸 CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ✅ *“A user created with the ‘guest’ role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ✅ *“The backup service runs as root but only needs read access.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ⚠️ This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### 🔸 CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ✅ *“User can access another user’s invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.”*

## Mapping Examples – Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *“User can escalate privileges to admin.”*
> ❌ Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged – only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ✅ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**

| “Escalate to root/admin”                    | Privilege escalation impact           | Not CWE-269! Use root cause (e.g., 266, 250) |
| “Assigned wrong role/group”                 | Misassigned privilege                 | CWE-266                                      |

| “Unauthorized read/write to file”           | Permission control issue              | CWE-285                                      |
| “Can access resource without correct role”  | Incorrect or missing permission check | CWE-285, 862, 863                            |

## Good Mapping Examples – Privileges & Permissions

* ✅ **CWE-266**: *“When a new user registers, the system assigns them admin role due to a missing role validation.”*
* ✅ **CWE-250**: *“Installer runs with system-level privileges but doesn't require them to install files in the user directory.”*
* ✅ **CWE-284**: *“Inconsistent access rules between UI and backend for sensitive endpoints.”*
* ✅ **CWE-285**: *“Authorization logic fails to restrict access to finance reports based on department.”*
