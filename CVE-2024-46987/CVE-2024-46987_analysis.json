  "description": "Camaleon CMS is a dynamic and advanced content management system based on Ruby on Rails. A **path traversal vulnerability** accessible via MediaControllers download_private_file method allows authenticated users to download any file on the web server Camaleon CMS is running on (depending on the file permissions). This issue may lead to Information Disclosure. This issue has been addressed in release version 2.8.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-46987:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation and sanitization in the `download_private_file` method of the Camaleon CMS application. This method directly uses a user-supplied parameter (`file`) to construct a file path without validating that it remains within the intended directory.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Path Traversal (CWE-22):** The application fails to prevent directory traversal using \"..\" sequences in the `file` parameter.\n*   **Uncontrolled Data Used in Path Expression:** The application directly uses user-controlled input to construct a file path.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Information Disclosure:** An authenticated attacker can download arbitrary files from the server, including sensitive files like `/etc/passwd`, application source code, and configuration files. This is possible due to the path traversal vulnerability allowing access outside the designated directory.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **HTTP Request Parameter Manipulation:** An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by crafting a malicious HTTP request to the `download_private_file` endpoint, including `../` sequences in the `file` parameter.\n*   **Authenticated User Required:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Camaleon CMS application to access the vulnerable endpoint.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have a valid account and be logged into the Camaleon CMS application.\n*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the application to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n*   The vulnerable code is in the `download_private_file` method within `app/controllers/camaleon_cms/admin/media_controller.rb` and `fetch_file` method in `app/uploaders/camaleon_cms_local_uploader.rb`.\n*   The vulnerability is present in Camaleon CMS version 2.8.0.\n*   The vulnerability is fixed in version 2.8.2.\n* The vulnerability was identified as GHSL-2024-183.\n* The exploit is a path traversal vulnerability.\n* The PoC uses a URL like `https:///admin/media/download_private_file?file=../../../../../../etc/passwd` to retrieve the `/etc/passwd` file.\n* The vulnerability is rated as high severity.\n* The identified vulnerability is linked to CWE-22, which relates to improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory.\n\nThe content from `codeql.github.com` provides generic information about path injection vulnerabilities, and the OWASP page provides general information about Path Traversal attacks. The reddit post confirms that the vulnerability was fixed in version 2.8.1.",

Several other CWEs were considered, including CWE-23 (Relative Path Traversal) and CWE-73 (External Control of File Name or Path). CWE-22 was selected because it directly addresses the **improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory**. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions a \"**path traversal vulnerability**\" and the ability for authenticated users to download arbitrary files, indicating a failure to properly restrict the path. CWE-23 is a child of CWE-22 and specifies the relative path traversal. CWE-73 can precede CWE-22 in a vulnerability chain.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\"]\n    cwe23[\"CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\"]\n    cwe73[\"CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\"]\n    \n    cwe23 -->|CHILDOF| cwe22\n    cwe73 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe22\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe22 primary\n    class cwe23,cwe73 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper input validation** of the file parameter, leading to **Path Traversal (CWE-22)**. This, in turn, results in **Information Disclosure**, as attackers can access sensitive files outside the intended directory.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary. The vulnerability description explicitly states a \"**path traversal vulnerability**\" exists. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation and sanitization, leading to **Path Traversal (CWE-22)** and subsequent Information Disclosure. The PoC uses a URL like `https:///admin/media/download_private_file?file=../../../../../../etc/passwd` to retrieve the `/etc/passwd` file.\n\nThe choice of CWE-22 is also supported by the Retriever Results, which lists it as the top candidate. The selection is further justified by the CWE's description, which aligns perfectly with the vulnerability's characteristics. CWE-22 is at the optimal level of specificity (Base) for this vulnerability.\n\nOther CWEs Considered:\n\n*   CWE-23 (Relative Path Traversal): Considered as a more specific variant of CWE-22, but the description doesn't explicitly mention relative path traversal, so it was not selected as the primary CWE.\n*   CWE-73 (External Control of File Name or Path): This CWE describes the broader issue of user-controlled file paths. While relevant, CWE-22 more accurately captures the specific vulnerability of path traversal.\n*   CWE-41 (Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence): Similar to CWE-22, but more specific to path equivalence issues. Since the vulnerability is primarily path traversal, CWE-22 is a better fit.\n*   CWE-285 (Improper Authorization): Though authenticated users are required, the primary issue is **lack of proper path validation**, not authorization.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
