# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-1497

## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability, that could result in Remote Code Execution (RCE), has been found in PlotAI. **Lack of validation of LLM-generated output** allows attacker to execute arbitrary Python code. Vendor commented out vulnerable line, further usage of the software requires uncommenting it and thus accepting the risk. The vendor does not plan to release a patch to fix this vulnerability.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **Lack of validation of LLM-generated output**
- **product:** PlotAI

- **attacker:** attacker

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-1497 based on provided content

The provided content details a vulnerability in the PlotAI software (CVE-2025-1497). Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information extracted from the content:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   Lack of validation of LLM-generated output. The software executes code generated by a Large Language Model (LLM) without proper sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')**.  The use of `exec()` function allows for arbitrary Python code execution.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker can execute arbitrary Python code on the system running the PlotAI software.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered by providing a crafted prompt to the LLM that generates malicious Python code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to provide input to the PlotAI software, specifically crafting a prompt that results in the LLM generating malicious code.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   The vendor has commented out the vulnerable `exec()` line in `plotai/code/executor.py`.  
*   To use the software, a user must *uncomment* the line, explicitly accepting the risk.
*   The vendor **does not plan to release a patch** to fix the vulnerability.

**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**

*   The vulnerability exists in versions of PlotAI up to and including 0.0.6.
*   The commit `bdcfb13484f0b85703a4c1ddfd71cb21840e7fde` explicitly comments out the `exec()` function as a mitigation.
*   The software uses `gpt-3.5-turbo` by default, but can be configured to use other OpenAI models.
*   The software sends the first 5 rows of the input DataFrame to the OpenAI API.
*   The developers provide a disclaimer about the risks associated with using the OpenAI language models and the potential costs involved.
*   The software is intended to be used with Python scripts and notebooks (Jupyter, Colab, VS Code).
