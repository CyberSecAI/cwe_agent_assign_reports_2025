  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-1497 based on provided content\n\nThe provided content details a vulnerability in the PlotAI software (CVE-2025-1497). Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information extracted from the content:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\n*   Lack of validation of LLM-generated output. The software executes code generated by a Large Language Model (LLM) without proper sanitization or validation.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')**.  The use of `exec()` function allows for arbitrary Python code execution.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   An attacker can execute arbitrary Python code on the system running the PlotAI software.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   The vulnerability is triggered by providing a crafted prompt to the LLM that generates malicious Python code.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   An attacker needs to be able to provide input to the PlotAI software, specifically crafting a prompt that results in the LLM generating malicious code.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   The vendor has commented out the vulnerable `exec()` line in `plotai/code/executor.py`.  \n*   To use the software, a user must *uncomment* the line, explicitly accepting the risk.\n*   The vendor **does not plan to release a patch** to fix the vulnerability.\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   The vulnerability exists in versions of PlotAI up to and including 0.0.6.\n*   The commit `bdcfb13484f0b85703a4c1ddfd71cb21840e7fde` explicitly comments out the `exec()` function as a mitigation.\n*   The software uses `gpt-3.5-turbo` by default, but can be configured to use other OpenAI models.\n*   The software sends the first 5 rows of the input DataFrame to the OpenAI API.\n*   The developers provide a disclaimer about the risks associated with using the OpenAI language models and the potential costs involved.\n*   The software is intended to be used with Python scripts and notebooks (Jupyter, Colab, VS Code).",

CWE-1427, while relevant, describes a broader issue of LLM prompting, whereas the vulnerability is specifically about code injection. CWE-77 is a peer of CWE-94, but is more specific to OS commands, whereas the code being injected is Python.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n    cwe1427[\"CWE-1427: Improper Neutralization of Input Used for LLM Prompting\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe913[\"CWE-913: Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources\"]\n    cwe1336[\"CWE-1336: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine\"]\n\n    cwe94 -->|CHILDOF| cwe913\n    cwe1336 -->|CHILDOF| cwe94\n    cwe77 -->|PEEROF| cwe94\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe94 primary\n    class cwe1427,cwe77 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of validation of LLM-generated output**. This leads to **improper control of generation of code** (CWE-94), allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary Python code, resulting in Remote Code Execution (RCE).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and CVE reference summary. The key evidence is the \"**lack of validation of LLM-generated output** allows attacker to execute arbitrary Python code.\" This directly points to CWE-94, as the software is generating code based on LLM output without proper control or sanitization. While CWE-1427 is relevant, it is more general.

Such an alteration could lead to arbitrary code execution.\n\n\nInjection problems encompass a wide variety of issues -- all mitigated in very different ways. For this reason, the most effective way to discuss these weaknesses is to note the distinct features which classify them as injection weaknesses. The most important issue to note is that all injection problems share one thing in common -- i.e., they allow for the injection of control plane data into the user-controlled data plane. This means that the execution of the process may be altered by sending code in through legitimate data channels, using no other mechanism. While buffer overflows, and many other flaws, involve the use of some further issue to gain execution, injection problems need only for the data to be parsed. The most classic instantiations of this category of weakness are SQL injection and format string vulnerabilities.\n",
