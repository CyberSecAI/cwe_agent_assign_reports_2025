## Vulnerability Description
A local user may find a configuration file on the client workstation with unencrypted sensitive data. This allows an attacker to impersonate the device or prevent the device from accessing the cloud portal which leads to a DoS.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **unencrypted configuration file**
- **impact:** access cloud portal and denial of service and DoS
- **attacker:** local user
