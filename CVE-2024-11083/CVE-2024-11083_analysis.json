  "description": "The ProfilePress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 4.15.18 via the WordPress core search feature. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to extract sensitive data from posts that have been restricted to higher-level roles such as administrator.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\n- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the ProfilePress plugin's content restriction mechanism, specifically when interacting with the WordPress core search functionality. The plugin fails to properly prevent the exposure of restricted content through search results.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n- **Unauthenticated Content Restriction Bypass:** The core issue is that the plugin's content restriction is bypassed by the WordPress search feature.\n- **Sensitive Information Exposure:**  Due to the bypass, content intended for higher-level roles (e.g., administrators) becomes accessible to unauthenticated users through search.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n- **Exposure of Sensitive Data:** Unauthenticated attackers can gain unauthorized access to sensitive information contained within restricted posts, such as administrator-level content and settings.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n- **WordPress Core Search:** The attack vector involves leveraging the WordPress core search functionality to retrieve restricted content.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n- **Unauthenticated User:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability; it can be exploited by any unauthenticated user.\n- **No special user capabilities required:** The attacker needs no special capabilities beyond the ability to access the website.\n\n**Additional Notes**\n\n- The provided changeset from `plugins.trac.wordpress.org` indicates a version bump from 4.15.18 to 4.15.19, which is the version that includes the patch for this vulnerability.\n- The Wordfence article also confirms that version 4.15.19 is the patched version.",

Though discouraged as a root cause, in this case the **sensitive information exposure** is the direct result of the plugin's failure to properly restrict access via the search function. |\n| CWE-862 | Missing Authorization | 0.7 | Class | Secondary | Allowed-with-Review. Represents the **missing** authorization check that led to the exposure. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship influencing the decision is that CWE-862 **Missing Authorization** can lead to CWE-200 **Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor**. While CWE-200 is discouraged as a root cause, the specific vulnerability description highlights the direct exposure of sensitive data as the most prominent weakness. The retriever results also suggest CWE-862 and CWE-200 as relevant candidates.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe862 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe862 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **missing authorization** check (CWE-862) when the WordPress core search feature accesses restricted posts. This **missing authorization** leads directly to the **exposure of sensitive information** (CWE-200) to unauthenticated attackers.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause and the resulting impact. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions **sensitive information exposure** as a key aspect. The retriever results and similar CVE descriptions also pointed towards CWE-200. While CWE-200 is generally discouraged as a primary mapping due to its focus on impact rather than root cause, the specific context of this vulnerability makes it the most fitting primary CWE. The plugin **fails to properly prevent the exposure of restricted content through search results**. This aligns directly with CWE-200. The **missing authorization** (CWE-862) is a prerequisite weakness that leads to the exposure.\n\nThe evidence supporting this decision is:\n- **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases:** \"**weakness:** **sensitive information exposure**\"\n- **CVE Reference Links Content Summary:** \"The plugin fails to properly prevent the exposure of restricted content through search results.\"\n- **CVE Reference Links Content Summary:** \"Due to the bypass, content intended for higher-level roles (e.g., administrators) becomes accessible to unauthenticated users through search.\"\n\nCWE-200 is selected as the primary CWE because the vulnerability description explicitly emphasizes the exposure of sensitive information as the main concern. CWE-862 is chosen as a secondary CWE to highlight the root cause.\n\nOther CWEs Considered:\n- CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization: Considered but not used because the primary issue is a **missing** authorization check, not an incorrect one.\n- CWE-639 Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key: Not applicable as there's no user-controlled key involved in the bypass.\n- CWE-425 Direct
