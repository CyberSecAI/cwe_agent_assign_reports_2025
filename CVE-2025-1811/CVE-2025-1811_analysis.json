  "description": "A vulnerability was found in AT Software Solutions ATSVD up to 3.4.1. It has been declared as critical. Affected by this vulnerability is an unknown functionality of the file /login.aspx of the component Login Endpoint. The manipulation of the argument txtUsuario leads to **sql injection**. The attack can be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. Upgrading to version 3.4.2 is able to address this issue. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component.",

The vulnerability description explicitly states that the manipulation of the argument txtUsuario leads to **sql injection**. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship that impacts the decision is that CWE-89 is a base CWE, providing a good level of specificity for the identified vulnerability, and it's a child of the class CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')). No other relationships significantly altered the decision, as the description clearly points to SQL Injection.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    \n    cwe89 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe89 primary\n    class cwe74 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain consists of the following:\n1.  The product **/login.aspx** endpoint receives input via the **txtUsuario** argument.\n2.  The product **fails to properly neutralize special elements** in this input.\n3.  An attacker injects SQL commands via the **txtUsuario** argument (**SQL Injection**).\n\nThe root cause is the **improper neutralization**, leading to the impact of SQL Injection.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis and the retriever results both strongly suggest CWE-89 as the primary weakness. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions **\"sql injection\"** due to the manipulation of the **txtUsuario** argument in **/login.aspx**, providing strong evidence. The retriever results also list CWE-89 as the top candidate with a score of 1.0.\n\nThe graph relationships support the selection of CWE-89, as it is a base-level CWE, providing sufficient specificity.\n\nThe selected CWE, CWE-89, is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability: the **improper neutralization** of special elements leading to SQL injection.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n- *Reason for not using*: While authentication is involved in the /login.aspx endpoint, the vulnerability is specifically SQL Injection, not an authentication algorithm implementation issue.\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component. Without sufficient removal or quoting of SQL syntax in user-controllable inputs, the generated SQL query can cause those inputs to be interpreted as SQL instead of ordinary user data.\n- *Reason for using*: Matches the provided information about **SQL injection** in the login functionality.\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n- *Reason for not using*: The vulnerability description does not provide any information about Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n- *Reason for not using*: The vulnerability description doesn't specify reliance on immutable web parameters.\n\n## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.\n- *Reason for not using*: The vulnerability description does not provide any information about Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n- *Reason for not using*: This vulnerability is not about unauthorized access to resources, but about SQL injection.\n\n## CWE-294: Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA capture-replay flaw exists when the design of the product makes it possible for a malicious user to sniff network traffic and bypass authentication by replaying it to the server in question to the same effect as the original message (or with minor changes).\n- *Reason for not using*: This vulnerability is not about bypassing authentication by replaying captured traffic.\n\n## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.\n- *Reason for not using*: There is no file upload functionality mentioned in the vulnerability description.\n\n## CWE-790: Improper Filtering of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives data from an upstream component, but does not filter or incorrectly filters special elements before sending it to a downstream component.\n- *Reason for not using*: While this is related, CWE-89 is more specific to SQL injection.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n- *Reason for not using*: While CWE-74 is a parent of CWE-89, CWE-89 is the better, more specific fit.\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 620.55\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.
