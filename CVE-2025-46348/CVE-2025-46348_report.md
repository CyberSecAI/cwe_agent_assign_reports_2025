# Analysis Report for CVE-2025-46348

# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2025-46348

## Description

YesWiki is a wiki system written in PHP. Prior to version 4.5.4, the request to commence a site backup can be performed and downloaded without authentication. **The archives are created with a predictable filename**, so a malicious user could create and download an archive without being authenticated. This could result in a malicious attacker making numerous requests to create archives and fill up the file system, or by downloading the archive which contains sensitive site information. This issue has been patched in version 4.5.4.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Vector:** making numerous requests to create archives
- **Weakness:** The archives are created with a predictable filename
- **Product:** YesWiki
- **Impact:** create numerous requests to create archives, fill up the file system, download the archive
- **Attacker:** malicious user
- **Version:** Prior to version 4.5.4

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary

| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | 1.0 | Base | Primary CWE | Allowed |
| CWE-341 | Predictable from Observable State | 0.7 | Base | Secondary Candidate | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis

The primary relationship influencing the selection was the need for authentication for critical functionality. CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) directly addresses this. CWE-341 (Predictable from Observable State) is related to the predictable filename aspect, and while relevant, it's secondary to the **missing authentication** issue. There are no direct parent-child or chain relationships that significantly alter the primary classification of CWE-306 as the root cause. The abstraction levels are both base, which is desired.

```

## Vulnerability Chain

The vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authentication** for the site backup functionality (CWE-306). This allows an attacker to initiate backups and download them. The predictable filename (CWE-341) exacerbates the issue, allowing easy retrieval of the backup. The impact is a potential Denial of Service (filling up the file system) or Site Compromise (downloading sensitive information).

CWE-306 (Missing Authentication) -> CWE-341 (Predictable Filename) -> Impact (DoS or Site Compromise)

## Summary of Analysis

The primary vulnerability is the **lack of authentication** for the site backup functionality, which aligns perfectly with CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function). The evidence clearly states, "The vulnerability stems from the fact that requests to initiate site backups and download the resulting archives do not require authentication." This is a direct match for CWE-306.

The secondary vulnerability is the **predictable filename** for the created archives (CWE-341). This enables an attacker to easily download the backup once it is created, which is an important factor.

The graph relationships confirm that there isn't a more appropriate child CWE for CWE-306. Both CWEs are at the Base level of abstraction.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly represent the root cause (**missing authentication**) and a significant contributing factor (**predictable filename**).

## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as ".." that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense
