Specifically, the \"Organization name\" parameter can be altered.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- Information Disclosure: Attackers can view sensitive information, including Personally Identifiable Information (PII), regarding vehicles, drivers, users, and other information belonging to different organizations within the system, regardless of their access level.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- The attack vector is by sending crafted HTTP requests to specific endpoints after obtaining valid credentials for PTC ThingWorx.\n- The attack relies on manipulating the \"Organization name\" parameter in POST requests to the listed endpoints.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- The attacker needs to have valid credentials to authenticate to the PTC ThingWorx application.\n- The attacker needs to be able to craft HTTP requests and modify the \"Organization name\" parameter.\n\n**Affected endpoints:**\n- `POST /Thingworx/Things/PostgreSQLNew/Services/VehicleProfile_NewV5?`\n- `POST /Thingworx/Things/PostgreSQL/Services/Driver_Pages_New_V3?`\n- `POST /Thingworx/Things/UsersThing/Services/GetUsersByOrganizationMultiQ?`",

The application allows an authenticated user to access resources they shouldn't have access to by directly manipulating parameters in the HTTP requests. |\n| CWE-497 | Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The vulnerability leads to exposure of sensitive information including PII. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key), which is a base-level CWE. CWE-497 (Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere) is included as a secondary CWE because the exploitation of CWE-639 leads to the exposure of sensitive information.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n    cwe497[\"CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\"]\n    \n    cwe639 -->|CAN_LEAD_TO| cwe497\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe639 primary\n    class cwe497 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **Insecure Direct Object Reference** (IDOR), specifically an Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key (CWE-639). This leads to Information Disclosure, specifically Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere (CWE-497), including Personally Identifiable Information (PII).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary vulnerability is an **Insecure Direct Object Reference** (IDOR) that allows attackers to view sensitive information. The root cause is identified as CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key) because the attacker is able to bypass authorization by manipulating the \"Organization name\" parameter. The impact is identified as CWE-497 (Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere) because sensitive information is exposed to unauthorized users.\n\nThe provided vulnerability description clearly states: \"An **Insecure Direct Object Reference** (IDOR) in PTC ThingWorx v9.5.0 allows attackers to view sensitive information, including PII, regardless of access level.\" The CVE Reference Links Content Summary states: \"The root cause is an Authenticated Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability in PTC ThingWorx v9.5.0.\" It also states: \"Attackers can view sensitive information, including Personally Identifiable Information (PII), regarding vehicles, drivers, users, and other information belonging to different organizations within the system, regardless of their access level.\"\n\nCWE-639 is the most specific and appropriate CWE because it directly addresses the **authorization bypass** achieved through a user-controlled key (the \"Organization name\" parameter). CWE-497 is included because it accurately describes the resulting exposure of sensitive information. Other CWEs, such as CWE-425 (Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')), were considered but deemed less specific to the root cause of the vulnerability. The selection is based on the evidence and the relationships between the CWEs, ensuring the chosen CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
