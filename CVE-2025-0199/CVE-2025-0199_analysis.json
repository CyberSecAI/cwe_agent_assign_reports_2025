  "description": "A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, was found in code-projects Point of Sales and Inventory Management System 1.0. Affected is an unknown function of the file /user/minus_cart.php. The manipulation of the argument id leads to **sql injection**. It is possible to launch the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.",

  },
  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe vulnerability is caused by the lack of sanitization or validation of user-supplied input in the `id` parameter within the `minus_cart.php` file of a \"pos-inventory-system-in-php\" application. This allows for direct injection of SQL code into the database query.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the presence of SQL injection in the `minus_cart.php` file through the `id` parameter. The application directly incorporates this parameter into the SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Data Breach:** A malicious attacker could exploit this vulnerability to obtain sensitive information from the server database.\n- **Data Manipulation:** It is also possible to modify or delete data from the database.\n- **Potential Complete System Takeover:** In some cases, SQL Injection can lead to remote command execution and complete system takeover.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP POST request to the `/POS_inventory/user/minus_cart.php` endpoint.\n- **`id` Parameter:** The malicious SQL code is injected through the `id` parameter.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server hosting the vulnerable application.\n- **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to craft and send HTTP POST requests.\n- **Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs to have a basic understanding of SQL syntax to craft malicious SQL payloads.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The provided PoC demonstrates a simple SQL injection attempt using `id=1&min=1`, this can be modified to perform more sophisticated attacks.\n- The application source is available at `<https://code-projects.org/pos-inventory-system-using-php-source-code/>`, this was identified as the source of the vulnerability.\n- The vulnerability exists in the `minus_cart.php` file.",

The vulnerability is a direct result of **improper SQL command neutralization**. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship considered was the direct match of the vulnerability to **CWE-89**. While other CWEs were considered, they were deemed less specific or representative of the root cause.\n  - The key factor was the **sql injection** vulnerability which mapped directly to CWE-89.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    \n    class cwe89 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward:\n  - **Root Cause:** Lack of input sanitization in `/user/minus_cart.php`\n  - **Weakness:** **SQL Injection** via the `id` parameter.\n  - **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, potential system takeover.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the explicit description of an **SQL Injection** vulnerability. The vulnerability description clearly states that the manipulation of the `id` argument leads to **SQL Injection**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this, stating that the **root cause** is the lack of sanitization of the `id` parameter, allowing for direct injection of SQL code.\n\nThe Retriever Results strongly support this, with **CWE-89** being the top result with a score of 1.000. Other CWEs were considered but deemed less relevant as they represent potential consequences or related weaknesses rather than the direct root cause.\n\nThe final selection is based on the evidence provided, the retriever results, and the CWE specifications, leading to a high confidence level in the mapping to **CWE-89**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.

Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**:

level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\n**Abstraction
