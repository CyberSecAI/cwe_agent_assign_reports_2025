## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved cachefiles add consistency check for copen/cread This prevents malicious processes from completing random copen/cread requests and crashing the system. Added checks are listed below * Generic, copen can only complete open requests, and cread can only complete read requests. * For copen, ondemand_id must not be 0, because this indicates that the request has not been read by the daemon. * For cread, the object corresponding to fd and req should be the same.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **completed random copen/cread requests**
- **impact:** crash the system
- **attacker:** malicious processes
- **product:** Linux kernel
- **component:** cachefiles

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of the vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper consistency checks in the `cachefiles` on-demand functionality when handling `copen` (complete open) and `cread` (complete read) requests. This allows malicious processes to potentially complete these requests with arbitrary data, leading to system instability or crashes.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Inadequate request validation:** The original code lacked sufficient validation to ensure `copen` requests were only completing open operations and that `cread` requests were completing read operations.
*   **Missing `ondemand_id` check for `copen`:** There was no check to ensure the `ondemand_id` in a `copen` request was not zero. A zero `ondemand_id` means the request has not been processed by the daemon, but it could still be completed.
*   **Missing object association check for `cread`:** The code did not verify if the object associated with the file descriptor and the request in a `cread` operation were the same.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **System Crash:** By sending malformed `copen` and `cread` requests, an attacker can cause the system to crash.
*   **Undefined behaviour:** Completing requests with incorrect data can lead to undefined and unpredictable behavior.

**Attack vectors:**

*   A malicious process can send crafted ioctl commands with arbitrary IDs and data to the `/dev/cachefiles` device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to interact with the `/dev/cachefiles` device, which typically requires local access to the system.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send specific ioctl commands.

**Additional notes**

* The provided commits introduce the following checks:
    *  `copen` can only complete open requests, and `cread` can only complete read requests.
    *  For `copen`, `ondemand_id` must not be 0
    * For `cread`, the object corresponding to fd and req should be the same.
*   The fixes involve using an `XA_STATE` structure to load and validate requests, and then clearing the request from the `cache->reqs` array.
*   The commit messages explicitly mention that this prevents malicious processes from completing random `copen`/`cread` requests and crashing the system.
