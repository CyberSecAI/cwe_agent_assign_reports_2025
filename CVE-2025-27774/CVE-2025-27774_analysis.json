  "description": "Applio is a voice conversion tool. Versions 3.2.7 and prior are vulnerable to **server-side request forgery** (SSRF) and file write in `model_download.py` (line 156 in 3.2.7). The **blind SSRF** allows for sending requests on behalf of Applio server and can be leveraged to probe for other vulnerabilities on the server itself or on other back-end systems on the internal network, that the Applio server can reach. The **blind SSRF** can also be coupled with the an arbitrary file read (e.g., CVE-2025-27784) to read files from hosts on the internal network, that the Applio server can reach, which would make it a full SSRF. The file write allows for writing files on the server, which can be coupled with other vulnerabilities, for example an unsafe **deserialization**, to achieve remote code execution on the Applio server. As of time of publication, no known patches are available.",

It also details the other vulnerabilities found in the Applio project.\n*   **Extracted Information:**\n    *   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the Applio application's handling of user-supplied URLs in the `model_download.py` file. Specifically, lines 194 in `download.py` and line 14 in `routes.py` take user-supplied URLs and use them to make HTTP GET requests in `model_download.py` (line 143).\n    *   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) and arbitrary file write.\n    *   **Impact of exploitation:** The blind SSRF allows sending requests on behalf of the Applio server, potentially probing internal network vulnerabilities. Coupled with the file write capability, an attacker can write files on the server, potentially leading to remote code execution by combining it with other vulnerabilities like unsafe deserialization.\n    *   **Attack vectors:** An attacker can provide a malicious URL to the endpoints in `download.py` and `routes.py`.\n    *   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious URL that the Applio server will then fetch.\n    *   **Mitigation or fix:** The content does not contain this information.\n*   **More detail than the official CVE description:** Yes. The content provides specific file names, line numbers, and code snippets related to the vulnerability within the Applio project.",

The secondary weakness, **CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data**, arises because the file write from the SSRF can be coupled with unsafe deserialization. The relationship between the two is sequential, with the SSRF potentially leading to the deserialization vulnerability. **CWE-20: Improper Input Validation** is a class level weakness that could be addressed to prevent the **SSRF**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe918[\"CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)\"]\n    cwe502[\"CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    \n    cwe918 -- CANPRECEDE --> cwe502\n    cwe918 -- REQUIRES --> cwe20\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe918 primary\n    class cwe502,cwe20 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the **improper input validation** potentially leading to a **server-side request forgery (SSRF)**. An attacker can then leverage the **SSRF** to perform a file write, which can be combined with an unsafe **deserialization** vulnerability to achieve remote code execution.\n\nThe chain is: **Improper Input Validation** -> **SSRF** -> **File Write** -> **Unsafe Deserialization** -> **Remote Code Execution**\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary vulnerability is clearly a **server-side request forgery (SSRF)** as the application does not properly validate the destination of the request.
