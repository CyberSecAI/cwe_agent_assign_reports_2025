Supported versions that are affected are 7.4.0, 7.4.1 and 7.5.0. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows low privileged attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise Oracle Communications Order and Service Management. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Oracle Communications Order and Service Management accessible data as well as unauthorized read access to a subset of Oracle Communications Order and Service Management accessible data and unauthorized ability to cause a partial denial of service (partial DOS) of Oracle Communications Order and Service Management. CVSS 3.1 Base Score 5.5 (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability impacts). CVSS Vector (CVSS3.1/AVN/ACL/PRL/UIR/SU/CL/IL/AL).
