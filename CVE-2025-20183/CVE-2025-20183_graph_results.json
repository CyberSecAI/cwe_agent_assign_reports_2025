  "query": "A vulnerability in a policy-based Cisco Application Visibility and Control (AVC) implementation of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco Secure Web Appliance could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to evade the antivirus scanner and download a malicious file onto an endpoint.&nbsp The vulnerability is due to improper handling of a crafted range request header. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending an HTTP request with a crafted range request header through the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to evade the antivirus scanner and download malware onto the endpoint without detection by Cisco Secure Web Appliance.",
