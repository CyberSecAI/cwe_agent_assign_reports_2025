  "description": "A vulnerability in a policy-based Cisco Application Visibility and Control (AVC) implementation of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco Secure Web Appliance could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to evade the antivirus scanner and download a malicious file onto an endpoint.&nbsp The vulnerability is due to **improper handling of a crafted range request header**. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending an HTTP request with a crafted range request header through the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to evade the antivirus scanner and download malware onto the endpoint without detection by Cisco Secure Web Appliance.",

While it's generally discouraged to use Class-level CWEs, in this case, the available information doesn't allow for a more specific Base or Variant-level mapping. CWE-1284 is a child of CWE-20, and the vulnerability description mentions \"crafted range request header\" which implies a specified quantity in the input, thus a lower confidence association.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe1284[\"CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\"]\n    \n    cwe1284 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe20 primary\n    class cwe1284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper handling of a crafted range request header** (CWE-20), leading to the evasion of the antivirus scanner and the download of a malicious file onto the endpoint.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nBased on the provided vulnerability description, the primary **weakness** is the **improper handling of a crafted range request header**. This aligns with CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation), as the appliance is not correctly validating the input from the HTTP range request header. The evidence for this is the Vulnerability Description Key Phrases which indicates **improper handling of a crafted range request header** is the rootcause. The CVE reference links content summary also mentions that the CWE is CWE-20.\n\nThe retriever results suggest CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input) as a strong candidate, and while it is a possibility, the provided description doesn't give enough information to confidently say that a *quantity* is the specific aspect of the input that's not being validated. Since CWE-1284 is a child of CWE-20, it could still be related.\n\nOther considered CWEs from the retriever results and complete CWE specifications:\n\n*   CWE-113 (Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')): This was considered because HTTP headers are involved, but the **vulnerability** isn't about CRLF injection.\n*   CWE-73 (External Control of File Name or Path): This was considered, but the **vulnerability** doesn't directly involve file paths.\n*   CWE-434 (Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type): While the impact involves downloading a malicious file, the root cause is not the unrestricted upload, but the **improper handling of the request**.\n\nTherefore, CWE-20 is the most appropriate CWE, even though it is a Class.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
