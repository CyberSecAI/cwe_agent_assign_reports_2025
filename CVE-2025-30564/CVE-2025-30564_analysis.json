  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-30564 Content\n\nThe content relates to CVE-2025-30564 as indicated by the CVE ID present in the document. It provides more detail than the placeholder CVE description.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). The document does not specify the exact root cause within the Custom Script Integration plugin, only that it *is* vulnerable to CSRF.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nA malicious actor can force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact varies case by case.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\nThe attack vector is through Cross-Site Request Forgery, meaning an attacker would need to trick a logged-in user into performing an action on the vulnerable website.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   Unauthenticated - The attacker does not need to be authenticated.\n*   Ability to create a malicious website or inject malicious content into a trusted site.\n*   Ability to trick a logged-in user into visiting the malicious site or clicking a malicious link.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   No official fix is currently available (as of March 24, 2025).\n*   Patchstack offers \"vPatching\" as a mitigation, which auto-mitigates the vulnerability even without an official patch.\n*   The document states the vulnerability has a low severity impact and is unlikely to be exploited.",

The CSRF allows an attacker to trick an authenticated user into performing actions that inject malicious scripts into the web application.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    \n    cwe79 <--|EXPLOITED_BY| cwe352\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe352 primary\n    class cwe79 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **CWE-352 [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)]** vulnerability, which allows an attacker to force a user to make a request that they did not intend to make.

This determination is strongly supported by the vulnerability description and the CVE reference summary, which explicitly mentions the **cross-site request forgery** as the **rootcause** and the resulting Stored **XSS vulnerability**.\n\nThe retriever results also highlight **CWE-352 [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)]** and **CWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')]** as highly relevant.\n\nThe selection of **CWE-352 [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)]** and **CWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')]** is at the optimal level of specificity because they directly represent the **rootcause** and weakness present in the vulnerability description.\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
