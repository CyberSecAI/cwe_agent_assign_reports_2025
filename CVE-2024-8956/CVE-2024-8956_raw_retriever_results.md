# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-8956
## Query
PTZOptics PT30X-SDI/NDI-xx before firmware 6.3.40 is vulnerable to an insufficient authentication issue. The camera does not properly enforce authentication to /cgi-bin/param.cgi when requests are sent without an HTTP Authorization header. The result is a remote and unauthenticated attacker can leak sensitive data such as usernames, password hashes, and configurations details. Additionally, the attacker can update individual configuration values or overwrite the whole file.

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: 'insufficient authentication'
- **weakness**: 'authentication issue'
