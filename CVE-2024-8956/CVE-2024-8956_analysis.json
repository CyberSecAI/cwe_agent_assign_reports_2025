  "description": "PTZOptics PT30X-SDI/NDI-xx before firmware 6.3.40 is vulnerable to an **insufficient authentication** issue. The camera does not properly enforce authentication to /cgi-bin/param.cgi when requests are sent without an HTTP Authorization header. The result is a remote and unauthenticated attacker can leak sensitive data such as usernames, password hashes, and configurations details. Additionally, the attacker can update individual configuration values or overwrite the whole file.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-8956\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe vulnerability stems from insufficient authentication for the `/cgi-bin/param.cgi` endpoint on PTZOptics cameras. This allows unauthorized access to modify device settings.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n- **Improper Authorization:** The primary issue is the lack of proper authentication checks on the `/cgi-bin/param.cgi` endpoint. This allows unauthenticated users to access and modify sensitive camera parameters via HTTP-CGI requests.\n- The vulnerability exists in the web interface of the affected cameras.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Confidentiality:** Attackers could potentially access sensitive information about the camera's configuration.\n- **Integrity:** Attackers can modify camera settings, potentially disrupting normal operation. For example, changing the video or network configurations.\n-  The vulnerability can lead to a complete compromise of the camera.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- The vulnerability is accessible over the network via HTTP-CGI requests.\n- An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable `/cgi-bin/param.cgi` endpoint.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable PTZOptics camera.\n- No prior authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.\n\n**Affected Products/Versions:**\n- PTZOptics PT30X-SDI before 6.3.40\n- PTZOptics PT30X-NDI-xx-G2 before 6.3.40\n- Other white-label AV equipment based on ValueHD Corporation PTZ Camera Firmware\n\n**Mitigation:**\n- The vulnerability is fixed in firmware version 6.3.40 and later for the affected PTZOptics cameras. Users should update their firmware. The firmware change log for version 6.3.40 mentions \"Added HTTP Authentication Option (available in System Settings)\" and \"Implemented Digest Authentication\" which addresses the vulnerability.\n\n**CVSS Score:** 9.1 (Critical)\n- CVSS Vector: AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The vulnerability is identified as \"Improper Authorization\"\n- The content provides more detail than the official CVE description by specifying the vulnerable endpoint and the general exploitation method.",

Since the vulnerability explicitly describes a scenario where authentication is entirely missing for a critical function, CWE-306 was chosen as the more specific and accurate representation. CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) was considered but deemed less appropriate because the issue is rooted in the complete absence of authentication, not a failure in authorization after authentication.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe862 -->|PEEROF| cwe306\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe306 primary\n    class cwe862 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of authentication (CWE-306)** for the `/cgi-bin/param.cgi` endpoint. This allows an unauthenticated attacker to access and modify sensitive camera parameters. The impact of this **missing authentication** leads to potential information disclosure (usernames, password hashes, and configuration details) and the ability to modify camera settings. Thus, the chain is:\n\nCWE-306 (Missing Authentication) -> Information Disclosure / Configuration Modification\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified several candidate CWEs, but the most accurate is CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function). The vulnerability description explicitly states that the camera **does not properly enforce authentication** to `/cgi-bin/param.cgi` when requests are sent without an HTTP Authorization header. This directly aligns with the definition of CWE-306.\n\nThe evidence supporting this decision is:\n- **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases**: \"**rootcause:** **insufficient authentication**\"\n- **CVE Reference Links Content Summary**: \"The vulnerability stems from **insufficient authentication** for the `/cgi-bin/param.cgi` endpoint on PTZOptics cameras. This allows unauthorized access to modify device settings.\"\n- **CVE Reference Links Content Summary**: \"The primary issue is the **lack of proper authentication checks** on the `/cgi-bin/param.cgi` endpoint. This allows unauthenticated users to access and modify sensitive camera parameters via HTTP-CGI requests.\"\n\nCWE-862 (Missing Authorization) was considered, but the root cause is the absence of authentication, not a failure in authorization after successful authentication. Therefore, CWE-306 is the more appropriate choice.\n\nThe selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity (Base) because it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability.\nThe CWE Classification Guidance was very helpful in differentiating Authentication vs. Authorization.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n- *Not selected*: The vulnerability is about **insufficient authentication**, not the usage of weak credentials.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n- *Not selected*: This doesn't apply as the vulnerability lies in **missing authentication**, not in relying on untrusted inputs.\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n- *Not selected*: The vulnerability is about **missing authentication**, not an incorrect implementation of an authentication algorithm.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
