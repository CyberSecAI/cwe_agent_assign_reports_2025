CWE-285 has a child CWE, CWE-863, \"Incorrect Authorization\", which is a more specific Class-level CWE. If the authorization check is present but flawed, CWE-863 would be a better fit than CWE-285. Since the provided description only mentions \"**improper authorization**\" without providing specifics about the nature of the flaw, CWE-285 is chosen but there is consideration for CWE-863 if more information is available.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe285 -->|ParentOf| cwe863\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe285 primary\n    class cwe863 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper authorization** in the `preHandle` function, leading to unauthorized access.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified **improper authorization** as the root cause. The retriever results suggested CWE-285, \"Improper Authorization,\" as a potential match, and the guidance confirms that this CWE is appropriate for general authorization failures.
