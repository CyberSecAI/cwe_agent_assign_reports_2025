  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved nilfs2 fix potential deadlock with newly created symlinks Syzbot reported that page_symlink(), called by nilfs_symlink(), triggers memory reclamation involving the filesystem layer, which can result in **circular lock dependencies among the reader/writer semaphore nilfs->ns_segctor_sem, s_writers percpu_rwsem (intwrite) and the fs_reclaim pseudo lock**. This is because after commit 21fc61c73c39 (dont put symlink bodies in pagecache into highmem), the gfp flags of the page cache for symbolic links are overwritten to GFP_KERNEL via inode_nohighmem(). This is not a problem for symlinks read from the backing device, because the __GFP_FS flag is dropped after inode_nohighmem() is called. However, when a new symlink is created with nilfs_symlink(), the gfp flags remain overwritten to GFP_KERNEL. Then, memory allocation called from page_symlink() etc. triggers memory reclamation including the FS layer, which may call nilfs_evict_inode() or nilfs_dirty_inode(). And these can cause a deadlock if they are called while nilfs->ns_segctor_sem is held Fix this issue by dropping the __GFP_FS flag from the page cache GFP flags of newly created symlinks in the same way that nilfs_new_inode() and __nilfs_read_inode() do, as a workaround until we adopt nofs allocation scope consistently or improve the locking constraints.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe root cause of the vulnerability is the incorrect handling of GFP flags for newly created symbolic links in the nilfs2 filesystem. After commit 21fc61c73c39, the page cache GFP flags for symlinks are overwritten to `GFP_KERNEL` via `inode_nohighmem()`. While symlinks read from the backing device correctly drop the `__GFP_FS` flag after this, newly created symlinks retain the `GFP_KERNEL` flag which can lead to a deadlock.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n- **Incorrect GFP Flag Handling:** The `__GFP_FS` flag is not dropped for newly created symlinks, leading to memory allocation issues.\n- **Circular Lock Dependencies:** The issue triggers memory reclamation that involves the filesystem layer, leading to circular lock dependencies involving `nilfs->ns_segctor_sem`, `s_writers percpu_rwsem (intwrite)` and `fs_reclaim`.\n- **Deadlock:** The circular dependencies can lead to a deadlock if `nilfs_evict_inode()` or `nilfs_dirty_inode()` are called while `nilfs->ns_segctor_sem` is held.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Denial of Service:** The deadlock can cause the system to become unresponsive, leading to a denial of service.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Symbolic Link Creation:** An attacker would need to create a new symbolic link on a nilfs2 filesystem. This action triggers the vulnerable code path.\n- The vulnerability was reported by syzbot, which uses automated fuzzing. Therefore, the specific user-space trigger is unknown, but it is reproducible with syzkaller.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **File system access:** The attacker must be able to create a symlink on a nilfs2 filesystem.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n- The fix involves dropping the `__GFP_FS` flag from the page cache GFP flags of newly created symlinks, similar to how it's done in `nilfs_new_inode()` and `__nilfs_read_inode()`.\n- This fix is considered a workaround until more robust solutions, such as consistently adopting nofs allocation or improving locking constraints, can be implemented.\n- The vulnerability was reported by syzbot, and the provided links give further context on the issue and fix.",

This leads to memory reclamation and then to **circular lock dependencies**. The **circular lock dependencies** result in a **deadlock**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nBased on the provided vulnerability description, the primary weakness is **CWE-667 Improper Locking**. The description explicitly mentions **circular lock dependencies among the reader/writer semaphore nilfs->ns_segctor_sem, s_writers percpu_rwsem (intwrite) and the fs_reclaim pseudo lock**. This indicates a fundamental issue with how locks are acquired and released within the nilfs2 filesystem. The direct consequence of this **improper locking** is a **deadlock**, making **CWE-833 Deadlock** a secondary, impact-oriented CWE. The **improper locking** also causes a **race condition** because the code is trying to access the same resources concurrently without proper synchronization.\n\nI considered **CWE-59 Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')** and **CWE-61 UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following**, because the vulnerability is related to symbolic links, but these CWEs focus on vulnerabilities related to the path that a symbolic link points to. The vulnerability description indicates the issue is with the locks held during the creation of symbolic links and not related to the path.\n\n# Relevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-61: UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product, when opening a file or directory, does not sufficiently account for when the file is a symbolic link that resolves to a target outside of the intended control sphere.
