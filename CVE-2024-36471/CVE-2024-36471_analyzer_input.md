# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-36471

## Vulnerability Description
**Import functionality is vulnerable to **DNS rebinding** attacks** between verification and processing of the URL. Project administrators can run these imports, which could cause Allura to read from internal services and expose them. This issue affects Apache Allura from 1.0.1 through 1.16.0. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 1.17.0, which fixes the issue. If you are unable to upgrade, set disable_entry_points.allura.importers = forge-tracker, forge-discussion in your .ini config file.
