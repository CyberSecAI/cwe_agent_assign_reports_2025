CWE-923 is a Class level CWE and a parent of CWE-1275 (Sensitive Cookie with Improper SameSite Attribute). CWE-918 describes the **root cause** of the vulnerability, where the server retrieves content from an unexpected destination due to **insufficient** checks.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe918[\"CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)\"]\n    cwe923[\"CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints\"]\n    cwe1275[\"CWE-1275: Sensitive Cookie with Improper SameSite Attribute\"]\n    \n    cwe1275 -->|CHILDOF| cwe923\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe918 primary\n    class cwe923 secondary\n    class cwe1275 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the import functionality, which is **vulnerable to DNS rebinding attacks**. This leads to the Allura server reading from internal services, effectively resulting in Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability involves an import functionality in Apache Allura being **vulnerable to DNS rebinding attacks**. This allows the system to read from internal services, effectively causing a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"**Import functionality is vulnerable to DNS rebinding attacks** between verification and processing of the URL. Project administrators can run these imports, which could cause Allura to read from internal services and expose them.\" The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" also highlights that the **root_cause** is \"The import functionality in Apache Allura is **vulnerable to DNS rebinding attacks** due to a **lack of proper verification** between the URL verification and processing stages.\"\n\nBased on the description and the Retriever results, CWE-918 (Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)) is the most appropriate primary CWE because the vulnerability allows the server to retrieve content from an unexpected destination due to **insufficient** checks.\n\nCWE-923 (Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints) is considered as a secondary CWE because the product establishes a communication channel but does not properly ensure that it is communicating with the correct endpoint. This is a broader categorization of the SSRF.\n\nCWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data) was considered, but the primary issue is not the insertion of sensitive information, but rather the unintended access to internal services. CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')) is not relevant because the vulnerability does not directly involve the generation of web pages with un-neutralized input. CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) is not the core issue, as the problem is related to improper destination validation rather than missing authentication.\n\nRelevant CWE
