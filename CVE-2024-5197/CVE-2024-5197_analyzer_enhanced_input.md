## Vulnerability Description
There exists interger overflows in libvpx in versions prior to 1.14.1. Calling vpx_img_alloc() with a large value of the d_w, d_h, or align parameter may result in **integer overflows** in the calculations of buffer sizes and offsets and some fields of the returned vpx_image_t struct may be invalid. Calling vpx_img_wrap() with a large value of the d_w, d_h, or stride_align parameter may result in **integer overflows** in the calculations of buffer sizes and offsets and some fields of the returned vpx_image_t struct may be invalid. We recommend upgrading to version 1.14.1 or beyond

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **integer overflows**
- **impact:** invalid values in struct fields
- **vector:** large d_w and d_h and align and stride_align
- **product:** libvpx
- **version:** prior to 1.14.1
- **component:** vpx_img_alloc() and vpx_img_wrap()

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-5197:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Integer overflows within the libvpx library.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Integer overflow vulnerabilities.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The provided text doesn't go into specific details regarding the impact of the overflow, but integer overflows can lead to various issues such as:
  - Memory corruption
  - Denial of service
  - Potential for arbitrary code execution in some cases (although not explicitly stated in this source)

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector would involve providing maliciously crafted VP8 or VP9 video streams to libvpx.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need to be able to supply crafted video data to an application that uses the vulnerable libvpx library. This might be achieved through tricking users into opening a malicious video, or by targeting server applications that process video content from untrusted sources.

**Additional Notes**
- The provided text is a security advisory from Debian LTS, which confirms the existence of the vulnerability and the availability of a fix.
- The advisory states that the vulnerability is present in `libvpx` version prior to `1.7.0-3+deb10u3` on Debian 10 (buster).
- It recommends upgrading the `libvpx` packages to address the issue.
- It refers to the Debian security tracker for detailed security status.
- This advisory provides more detail than the placeholder CVE description by describing the vulnerability type as integer overflow.
