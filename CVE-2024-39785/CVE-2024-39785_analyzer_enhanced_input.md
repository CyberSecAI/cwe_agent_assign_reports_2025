## Vulnerability Description
Multiple command execution vulnerabilities exist in the nas.cgi add_dir() functionality of Wavlink AC3000 M33A8.V5030.210505. A specially crafted HTTP request can lead to arbitrary command execution. An attacker can make an authenticated HTTP request to trigger these vulnerabilities.A command injection vulnerability exists in the adddir_name POST parameter.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2024-39785 Content

This content is **RELEVANT** to CVE-2024-39785 and provides more detail than the placeholder CVE description.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The Wavlink AC3000 router's `nas.cgi` binary does not properly sanitize user input received via HTTP POST requests, specifically within the `add_dir()` function. It uses `web_get()` to retrieve values from the POST data for parameters like `adddir_name` and `disk_part` and then directly incorporates these values into system commands executed via `do_system()`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Command Injection (CWE-74):**  Improper neutralization of special elements in output used by a downstream component. The lack of input validation allows attackers to inject arbitrary shell commands.

**Impact of exploitation:**

Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands on the router with the privileges of the web server process. This can lead to:

*   Full system compromise
*   Data theft
*   Denial of service
*   Remote control of the device

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker with network access to the Wavlink AC3000 router can exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Authenticated HTTP Request:** The attacker needs to make an authenticated HTTP POST request (i.e., logged in as a valid user) to the `nas.cgi` endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   Network access to the vulnerable device.
*   Valid credentials to log into the router's web interface.
*   Understanding of shell commands and command injection techniques.

**Mitigation or fix:**

The report does not explicitly state a fix, but implies that proper input validation and sanitization within the `nas.cgi` script are necessary to prevent command injection. The vendor was working on patches at the time of the report. The product has been discontinued.

**Specific Vulnerabilities Detailed:**

*   **CVE-2024-39784 - disk\_part command injection:** Injecting commands into the `disk_part` POST parameter.
*   **CVE-2024-39785 - adddir\_name command injection:** Injecting commands into the `adddir_name` POST parameter.

**CVSSv3 Score:** 9.1 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Confirmed Vulnerable Versions:**
