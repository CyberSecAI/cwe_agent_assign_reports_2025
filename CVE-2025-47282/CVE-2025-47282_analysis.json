  "description": "Gardener External DNS Management is an environment to manage external DNS entries for a kubernetes cluster. A security vulnerability was discovered in Gardeners External DNS Management prior to version 0.23.6 that could allow a user with administrative privileges for a Gardener project or a user with administrative privileges for a shoot cluster, including administrative privileges for a single namespace of the shoot cluster, to obtain control over the seed cluster where the shoot cluster is managed. This CVE affects all Gardener installations no matter of the public cloud provider(s) used for the seed clusters/shoot clusters. The affected component is `gardener/external-dns-management`. The `external-dns-management` component may also be deployed on the seeds by the `gardener/gardener-extension-shoot-dns-service` extension when the extension is enabled. In this case, all versions of the `shoot-dns-service` extension `<= v1.60.0` are affected by this vulnerability. Version 0.23.6 of Gardener External DNS Management fixes the issue.",

  "analysis": "# Summary\n| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| CWE-266 | Incorrect Privilege Assignment | 0.8 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE. The root cause is the **incorrect assignment of privileges** that allows a user with admin privileges for a Gardener project or shoot cluster to obtain control over the seed cluster. |\n| CWE-863 | Incorrect Authorization | 0.6 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary CWE. The **incorrect authorization** allows a user with administrative privileges for a Gardener project or a shoot cluster to obtain control over the seed cluster. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-266, which represents the root cause of the vulnerability: the incorrect assignment of privileges. CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) is related as a consequence or contributing factor, as the **incorrect authorization** check allows the privilege escalation to occur. While CWE-863 is a Class-level CWE, it's included to highlight the authorization aspect of the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe266[\"CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe863 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe266\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe266 primary\n    class cwe863 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **incorrect privilege assignment** (CWE-266). This leads to **incorrect authorization** (CWE-863), enabling a user with administrative privileges for a Gardener project or shoot cluster to gain control over the seed cluster.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, specifically the CVE description and the analysis of CVE-2025-47282 content. The key phrase \"user with administrative privileges for a Gardener project or a shoot cluster...obtain control over the seed cluster\" strongly indicates a privilege management issue. The analysis of CVE-2025-47282 mentions \"A malicious Google credential in a DNS secret can lead to privilege escalation,\" which further supports the privilege-related nature of the vulnerability.\n\nThe selection of CWE-266 is based on the guidance that highlights its relevance to scenarios where a user is assigned incorrect privileges due to misconfiguration or faulty logic. The provided guidance explicitly states: \u201cA user created with the \u2018guest\u2019 role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.\u201d In this case, a user with administrative privileges for a Gardener project is incorrectly granted control over the seed cluster.\n\nCWE-863 is included as a secondary CWE because the vulnerability involves an **authorization** check that is performed incorrectly, leading to the privilege escalation.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly address the root cause (**incorrect privilege assignment**) and a contributing factor (**incorrect authorization**). While higher-level CWEs like CWE-269 (Improper Privilege Management) could be considered, they are too generic and don't capture the specific nature of the vulnerability as effectively as CWE-266 and CWE-863.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n*   **CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment**: This aligns directly with the scenario described in the vulnerability, where a user with administrative privileges for a Gardener project or shoot cluster gains unauthorized control over the seed cluster. This is a Base level CWE, which is the preferred level.\n*   **CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization**: This is relevant because the **incorrect assignment of privileges** leads to flawed authorization checks, allowing the user to perform actions they should not be authorized to perform. This is a Class level CWE, and might have more specific children that would be more appropriate.\n*   **CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management**: While this CWE is related, it is too general and does not capture the specific root cause of the vulnerability as precisely as CWE-266. Also, CWE-269 is discouraged for use.\n*   **CWE-285: Improper Authorization**: Similar to CWE-863, but less specific. CWE-863 is a better fit because it directly addresses the **incorrectness** of the authorization. Also, CWE-285 is discouraged for use.\n*   **CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function**: This is not the primary issue, as the vulnerability focuses on privilege escalation due to **incorrect privilege assignment**, not a complete lack of authentication.\n*   **CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints**: This is not directly related to the core issue of **privilege misassignment**.",
