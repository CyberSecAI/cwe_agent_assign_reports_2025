  "query": "An issue in `.npmrc` support in Deno 1.44.0 was discovered where Deno would send `.npmrc` credentials for the scope to the tarball URL when the registry provided URLs for a tarball on a different domain. All users relying on .npmrc are potentially affected by this vulnerability if their private registry references tarball URLs at a different domain. This includes usage of deno install subcommand, auto-install for npm specifiers and LSP usage. It is recommended to upgrade to Deno 1.44.1 and if your private registry ever serves tarballs at a different domain to rotate your registry credentials.",
