# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-46713
## Query
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved perf/aux Fix AUX buffer serialization Ole reported that event->mmap_mutex is strictly insufficient to serialize the AUX buffer, add a per RB mutex to fully serialize it. Note that in the lock order comment the perf_eventmmap_mutex order was already wrong, that is, it nesting under mmap_lock is not new with this patch.

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: 'insufficient locking'
