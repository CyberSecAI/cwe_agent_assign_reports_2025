# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-7254

## Vulnerability Description
Any project that parses untrusted Protocol Buffers data containing an arbitrary number of nested groups / series of SGROUP tags can corrupted by **exceeding the stack limit** i.e. **StackOverflow**. Parsing nested groups as unknown fields with DiscardUnknownFieldsParser or Java Protobuf Lite parser, or against Protobuf map fields, creates unbounded recursions that can be abused by an attacker.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **exceeding the stack limit**
- **weakness:** **StackOverflow**
- **vector:** Parsing nested groups as unknown fields
- **attacker:** an attacker
