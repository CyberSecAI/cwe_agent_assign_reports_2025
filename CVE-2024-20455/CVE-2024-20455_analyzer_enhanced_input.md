## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability in the process that classifies traffic that is going to the Unified Threat Defense (UTD) component of Cisco IOS XE Software in controller mode could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. This vulnerability exists because UTD **improperly handles certain packets** as those packets egress an SD-WAN IPsec tunnel. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted traffic through an SD-WAN IPsec tunnel that is configured on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition. Note SD-WAN tunnels that are configured with Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) are not affected by this vulnerability.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **improperly handles certain packets**
- **impact:** denial of service (DoS)
- **vector:** crafted traffic through an SD-WAN IPsec tunnel
- **attacker:** unauthenticated remote attacker
- **product:** Cisco IOS XE Software
- **component:** Unified Threat Defense (UTD) component

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists because the Unified Threat Defense (UTD) component of Cisco IOS XE Software in controller mode improperly handles certain packets as they egress an SD-WAN IPsec tunnel.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper handling of specific packets by the UTD component when egressing an SD-WAN IPsec tunnel.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit could allow an attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted traffic through an SD-WAN IPsec tunnel configured on an affected device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send crafted traffic through an SD-WAN IPsec tunnel. They do not need authentication to exploit this vulnerability.
