  "description": "Symphony process is a module for the Symphony PHP framework which executes commands in sub-processes. On Windows, when an executable file named `cmd.exe` is located in the current working directory it will be called by the `Process` class when preparing command arguments, leading to possible hijacking. This issue has been addressed in release versions 5.4.46, 6.4.14, and 7.1.7. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2024-51736.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the relevant details:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n- On Windows, the `Process` class in Symfony could be tricked into executing a malicious `cmd.exe` located in the current working directory instead of the system's `cmd.exe`. This is due to how the `Process` class prepares command arguments on Windows.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n- The vulnerability is a command execution hijack, where a local attacker can cause arbitrary code to execute.\n- The vulnerability stems from the fact that the Process class does not use the absolute path when calling cmd.exe and will use a local `cmd.exe` if available.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- An attacker could potentially achieve arbitrary code execution by placing a malicious `cmd.exe` in a directory where a vulnerable application executes.\n- This could lead to a complete compromise of the system if the application runs with sufficient privileges.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker needs to be able to place a malicious `cmd.exe` file in a directory where a vulnerable application is running.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- The attacker needs local access to the system.\n- The attacker needs to be able to write files to the current working directory of the vulnerable application, or any directory which may be searched for executables.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n- The affected versions of `symfony/process` are: <5.4.46, >=6, <6.4.14, and >=7, <7.1.7.\n- Patched versions are 5.4.46, 6.4.14, and 7.1.7.\n- The fix involves the `Process` class now using the absolute path to `cmd.exe`.\n- The vulnerability is assigned a \"Low\" severity score.\n- The CVSS score is CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:N, with local attack vector.\n- The vulnerability is categorized under CWE-77 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command).",

The program **does not properly neutralize** special elements. |\n| CWE-427 | Uncontrolled Search Path Element | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate. The product uses a fixed or controlled search path to find resources, but one or more locations in that path can be under the control of unintended actors. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-78, which is a base-level CWE and a child of CWE-77. CWE-78 represents the **root cause** of the vulnerability, where the software fails to neutralize special elements used in OS commands, leading to command injection. CWE-427 is a secondary candidate because the vulnerability involves the application's search path being exploited by an attacker.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe427[\"CWE-427: Uncontrolled Search Path Element\"]\n    \n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe77,cwe427 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper handling of command arguments**, leading to the potential execution of a malicious `cmd.exe`. The chain can be described as follows:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Improper neutralization** of special elements used in an OS command (`cmd.exe`).\n2.  **Weakness:** **Command injection** due to the ability to execute commands in sub-processes.\n3.  **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on the root cause described in the vulnerability description, which is the ability to inject and execute arbitrary commands. The evidence for this is taken directly from the CVE description: \"On Windows, the `Process` class in Symfony could be tricked into executing a malicious `cmd.exe` located in the current working directory instead of the system's `cmd.exe`.
