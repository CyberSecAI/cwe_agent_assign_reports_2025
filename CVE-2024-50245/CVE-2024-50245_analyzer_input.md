# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-50245

## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved fs/ntfs3 Fix possible **deadlock** in mi_read Mutex lock with another subclass used in ni_lock_dir().

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **deadlock**
- **vector:** concurrent access
- **product:** Linux kernel
- **component:** fs/ntfs3 mi_read Mutex lock

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a potential deadlock in the `ntfs3` filesystem driver related to the locking mechanism when looking up directory entries. The `mi_readMutex` lock used in `mi_read` could potentially conflict with the lock used by `ni_lock_dir()`, leading to a deadlock situation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Deadlock:** The primary weakness is the possibility of a deadlock occurring due to the interaction between `mi_readMutex` and the lock used in `ni_lock_dir()`. This happens because `ni_lock` was used instead of `ni_lock_dir`, which caused a potential lock inversion.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The deadlock can cause the affected process to become unresponsive, leading to a denial-of-service condition. This would likely impact the system's ability to access the filesystem and potentially lead to broader instability.

**Attack vectors:**
-  The vulnerability is triggered through the `ntfs_lookup` function, specifically when calling the `dir_search_u` to search for a directory. This would likely occur during normal filesystem operations, such as accessing files and directories via the ntfs3 filesystem.
- The specific conditions triggering the deadlock are related to the timing and interaction of multiple threads or processes accessing the file system concurrently. The `syzbot` report suggests that automated fuzzing was able to trigger the condition, indicating that it is reachable under normal operation.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Local Access:** An attacker would need to have a user account with the ability to perform file system operations within an ntfs3 formatted partition.
- **Concurrency:** To trigger the deadlock, the attacker would need to perform actions (or make the system perform actions) that can trigger concurrent file system operations, leading to a conflict in the locking mechanism.

**Additional Information:**
- The provided patches change the `ni_lock(ni)` call to `ni_lock_dir(ni)` in `fs/ntfs3/namei.c`. This suggests that the original use of `ni_lock` was incorrect in the context of directory lookups, and the specific `ni_lock_dir` is intended for this purpose.
- The patch is backported to multiple stable branches of the Linux kernel, indicating the seriousness of the vulnerability.
-  The patch is reported by syzbot, suggesting that the vulnerability was discovered by an automated fuzzing system.
