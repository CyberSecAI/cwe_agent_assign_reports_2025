This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of received IPv4 PIMv2 packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted PIMv2 packet to a PIM-enabled interface on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause an affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition. Note This vulnerability can be exploited with either an IPv4 multicast or unicast packet. Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-20 CWE-119 CWE-401 CWE-1284 CWE-1285 CWE-400 CWE-410 CWE-406",
