# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-47686
## Query
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ep93xx clock Fix off by one in ep93xx_div_recalc_rate() The psc->div[] array has psc->num_div elements. These values come from when we call clk_hw_register_div(). Its adc_divisors and ARRAY_SIZE(adc_divisors)) and so on. So this condition needs to be >= instead of > to prevent an out of bounds read.

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: 'off by one'
