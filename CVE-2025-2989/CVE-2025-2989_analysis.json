CWE-285 is a Class, while CWE-425 is a Base. Since the vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"**improper access controls**\", CWE-285 aligns well as the primary weakness.

The Retriever Results suggested several CWEs related to authorization and access control.\n\nCWE-285 (Improper Authorization) stands out as the most relevant primary weakness because it directly reflects the **improper access controls** identified in the vulnerability description. It's a Class-level CWE, but in this case, it accurately represents the general weakness without needing a more specific Base variant as the description doesn't provide granular information on the exact type of authorization failure.\n\nCWE-425 (Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')) is a strong secondary candidate, it represents a specific case of improper authorization. It is selected as a secondary candidate, but not the primary because the description does not have enough detail to determine that this is specifically a forced browsing issue.\n\nThe relationship graph reinforces this selection, showing how CWE-425 is a specific type of CWE-285.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 3 | 285 | Improper Authorization | Class | Discouraged | sparse | 0.355 |\n| 10 | 425 | Direct Request ('Forced Browsing') | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.002 |\n\nCWE-285 is used because the vulnerability is directly related to **improper access controls**.
