  "query": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ibmvnic Use kernel helpers for hex dumps Previously, when the driver was printing hex dumps, the buffer was cast to an 8 byte long and printed using string formatters. If the buffer size was not a multiple of 8 then a read buffer overflow was possible. Therefore, create a new ibmvnic function that loops over a buffer and calls hex_dump_to_buffer instead.
