## Vulnerability Description
decNumberCopy in decNumber.c in jq through 1.7.1 does not properly consider that NaN is interpreted as numeric, which has a resultant stack-based buffer overflow and out-of-bounds write, as demonstrated by use of --slurp with subtraction, such as a filter of .-. when the input has a certain form of digit string with NaN (e.g., 1 NaN123 immediately followed by many more digits).

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **component:** decNumberCopy in decNumber.c
- **weakness:** **stack-based buffer overflow, out-of-bounds write**
- **product:** jq
- **version:** through 1.7.1
