Prior to version 7.0.7, **missing initialization of the random seed for thash** leads to byte-range tracking having predictable hash table behavior. This can lead to an attacker forcing lots of data into a single hash bucket, leading to severe performance degradation. This issue has been addressed in 7.0.7.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-47188:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe root cause of the vulnerability is the missing initialization of the random seed for the \"thash\" function used in byte-range tracking within the Suricata intrusion detection system.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\nThe primary weakness is the predictable hash table behavior due to the lack of a random seed for the hash function. This makes it possible for an attacker to control hash collisions by crafting specific requests.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nExploitation leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. By forcing many data entries into the same hash bucket, an attacker can cause severe performance degradation, making the system unavailable.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\nThe attack vector is network-based, meaning the attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious HTTP requests.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\nAn attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable Suricata instance. No specific user interaction or privileges are required for this attack to succeed. The attacker needs to understand how to craft HTTP requests with specific byte-ranges that cause predictable hash collisions.\n\n**Additional details:**\n- The vulnerability is present in Suricata versions prior to 7.0.7.\n- The vulnerability is related to a previous issue (Security #7209) that was also about the lack of random factor in \"thash\".\n- The CVSS score is 7.5, with high impact on availability.\n- The vulnerability is classified as CWE-330 (Use of Insufficiently Random Values).",

The vulnerability leads to predictable hash table behavior, which can be exploited to cause performance degradation. This impact aligns with CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption), as the attacker can force excessive resource usage.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe337[\"CWE-337: Predictable Seed in Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)\"]\n    cwe335[\"CWE-335: Incorrect Usage of Seeds in Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)\"]\n    cwe330[\"CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    \n    cwe337 -->|CHILDOF| cwe335\n    cwe335 -->|CHILDOF| cwe330\n    cwe337 -->|CANLEADTO| cwe400\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe337 primary\n    class cwe335,cwe330,cwe400 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing initialization of the random seed** (CWE-337), leading to predictable hash table behavior. This predictability allows an attacker to craft requests that cause many data entries to fall into the same hash bucket, resulting in severe performance degradation and ultimately leading to uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400).\n  - **Root Cause:** CWE-337: Predictable Seed in Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)\n  - **Weakness:** Predictable hash table behavior\n  - **Impact:** CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis correctly identified **missing initialization of the random seed for thash** as the root cause. The provided evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE Reference Links Content Summary strongly supports this assessment. The selection of CWE-337 (Predictable Seed in Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)) is justified because the **missing initialization** leads to a predictable seed being used. This predictability is the core weakness that enables the attack. CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) is a secondary concern as it represents the impact of exploiting the predictable seed. The graph relationships clarify the connection between the predictable seed, the resulting predictable hash table behavior, and the ultimate impact of resource exhaustion. CWE-337 is selected because it is the most specific and accurate representation of the root cause based on the available evidence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
