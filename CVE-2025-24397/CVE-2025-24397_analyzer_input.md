# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-24397

## Vulnerability Description
An **incorrect permission check** in Jenkins GitLab Plugin 1.9.6 and earlier allows attackers with global Item/Configure permission (while lacking Item/Configure permission on any particular job) to enumerate credential IDs of GitLab API token and Secret text credentials stored in Jenkins.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **incorrect permission check**
- **impact:** enumerate credential IDs of GitLab API token and Secret text credentials
- **attacker:** attackers with global Item/Configure permission
- **product:** Jenkins GitLab Plugin
- **version:** 1.9.6 and earlier

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-24397 based on provided content:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2025-24397

**Vulnerability:** Incorrect permission check in GitLab Plugin allows enumerating credentials IDs.

**Root Cause:** The GitLab Plugin (version 1.9.6 and earlier) does not correctly perform a permission check in an HTTP endpoint.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   Insufficient permission checks.
*   Credential ID enumeration.

**Impact of Exploitation:** Attackers with global Item/Configure permission (but lacking Item/Configure permission on specific jobs) can enumerate credential IDs of GitLab API token credentials and Secret text credentials stored in Jenkins. This information can be used in further attacks to capture the credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   An attacker with global Item/Configure permission can exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have global Item/Configure permission in Jenkins.

**Mitigation/Fix:**
*   Upgrade to GitLab Plugin version 1.9.7 or later.  In version 1.9.7, credential ID enumeration requires Overall/Administer permission.

**Additional Details:** The content provides more detail than the official CVE description (which is currently a placeholder). It specifies the affected versions, the specific permission required for exploitation, and the type of credentials that can be enumerated.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* 🔍 *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* 🔍 *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion – CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### 🔸 CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ✅ *“A user created with the ‘guest’ role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ✅ *“The backup service runs as root but only needs read access.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ⚠️ This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### 🔸 CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ✅ *“User can access another user’s invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.”*

## Mapping Examples – Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *“User can escalate privileges to admin.”*
> ❌ Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged – only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ✅ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**

| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| “Escalate to root/admin”                    | Privilege escalation impact           | Not CWE-269! Use root cause (e.g., 266, 250) |
| “Assigned wrong role/group”                 | Misassigned privilege                 | CWE-266                                      |
| “Runs as root” or “Should not run as admin” | Over-privileged execution             | CWE-250                                      |
| “Unauthorized read/write to file”           | Permission control issue              | CWE-285                                      |
| “Can access resource without correct role”  | Incorrect or missing permission check | CWE-285, 862, 863                            |

## Good Mapping Examples – Privileges & Permissions

* ✅ **CWE-266**: *“When a new user registers, the system assigns them admin role due to a missing role validation.”*
* ✅ **CWE-250**: *“Installer runs with system-level privileges but doesn't require them to install files in the user directory.”*
* ✅ **CWE-284**: *“Inconsistent access rules between UI and backend for sensitive endpoints.”*
* ✅ **CWE-285**: *“Authorization logic fails to restrict access to finance reports based on department.”*
