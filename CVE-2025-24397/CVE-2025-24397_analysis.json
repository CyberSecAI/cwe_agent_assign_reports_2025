This information can be used in further attacks to capture the credentials.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n*   An attacker with global Item/Configure permission can exploit the vulnerability.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n*   The attacker needs to have global Item/Configure permission in Jenkins.\n\n**Mitigation/Fix:**\n*   Upgrade to GitLab Plugin version 1.9.7 or later.  In version 1.9.7, credential ID enumeration requires Overall/Administer permission.\n\n**Additional Details:** The content provides more detail than the official CVE description (which is currently a placeholder). It specifies the affected versions, the specific permission required for exploitation, and the type of credentials that can be enumerated.",

CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) is a child of CWE-285 (Improper Authorization), which is a broader class. However, CWE-863 is more specific because it directly addresses the flawed authorization logic, making it a more accurate fit than its parent. CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials) is related to the impact of the vulnerability, specifically the exposure of credential IDs. It's considered a secondary CWE because it describes the outcome rather than the root cause.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    \n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe522 -.->|IMPACT| cwe863\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe522 secondary\n    class cwe285 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **incorrect permission check** (CWE-863). This leads to the ability to enumerate credential IDs of GitLab API tokens and Secret text credentials (CWE-522). The chain progresses from the flawed authorization check to the potential exposure of sensitive information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified several potential CWEs, including CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) and CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization). The vulnerability description clearly states an **incorrect permission check**, ruling out CWE-862. The evidence from the vulnerability description key phrases indicates a root cause of \"**incorrect permission check**\". This aligns directly with CWE-863, which describes a situation where an authorization check is performed, but it is done incorrectly. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also supports this by stating that the GitLab Plugin \"does not correctly perform a permission check.\" The impact, credential ID enumeration, is represented by CWE-522.\n\nThe choice of CWE-863 is at the optimal level of specificity. While CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) is a parent class, CWE-863 provides more precise details about the nature of the authorization failure.\nThe inclusion of CWE-522 highlights the impact of the vulnerability, namely the exposure of credentials.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
