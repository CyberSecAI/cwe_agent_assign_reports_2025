## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved media venus hfi add check to handle **incorrect queue size** qsize represents size of shared queued between driver and video firmware. Firmware can modify this value to an invalid large value. In such situation, empty_space will be bigger than the space actually available. Since new_wr_idx is not checked, so the following code will result in an **OOB write**. ... qsize = qhdr->q_size if (wr_idx >= rd_idx) empty_space = qsize - (wr_idx - rd_idx) .... if (new_wr_idx **OOB write** Add check to ensure qsize is within the allocated size while reading and writing packets into the queue.
