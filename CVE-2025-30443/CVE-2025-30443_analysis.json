CWE-284 is a Pillar, so it is discouraged from being used directly.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe277[\"CWE-277: Insecure Inherited Permissions\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n\n    cwe277 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe277 primary\n    class cwe284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is as follows:\n1.  The **root cause** is CWE-277, where insecure permissions are inherited.\n2.  This leads to the impact of an app being able to access user-sensitive data, which falls under the umbrella of CWE-284.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description indicates that an application can access user-sensitive data, which is a privacy issue. The description states that the issue was addressed by removing the vulnerable code. From the evidence, the **rootcause** is likely due to **insecure inherited permissions**, as indicated by the AppleMobileFileIntegrity component mentioned in the CVE Reference Links Content Summary.\n\nCWE-277 Insecure Inherited Permissions is a Variant level CWE and is the best fit.\n\nCWE-284 Improper Access Control is a high-level Pillar CWE, which is generally discouraged unless a more specific Base or Variant CWE cannot be identified. It is included here as a secondary candidate due to the impact of the vulnerability.\n\nCWE-787, CWE-843, CWE-665, CWE-20, CWE-285, CWE-1390, CWE-347, and CWE-770 were considered but not selected because the vulnerability description does not provide enough information to confidently map to these CWEs. The vulnerability description only indicates that there is a privacy issue where an app may be able to access user-sensitive data, and the issue was fixed by removing the vulnerable code.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-451: User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe user interface (UI) does not properly represent critical information to the user, allowing the information - or its source - to be obscured or spoofed.
