# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-8452

# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-8452
## Query
Certain switch models from PLANET Technology only support obsolete algorithms for authentication protocol and encryption protocol in the SNMPv3 service, allowing attackers to obtain plaintext SNMPv3 credentials potentially.

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: 'obsolete algorithms for authentication protocol', 'encryption protocol'
