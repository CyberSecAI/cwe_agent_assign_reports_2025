While it would be ideal to have a Base or Variant level CWE, there isn't sufficient information to determine which specific algorithm is broken or risky. CWE-327 relates to CWE-319 because using a broken algorithm can lead to sensitive information being transmitted in cleartext. CWE-327 also has a parent relationship with CWE-1240 (Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation), which is more specific but not directly supported by the evidence.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe327[\"CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\"]\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe1240[\"CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\"]\n    \n    cwe1240 -->|CHILDOF| cwe327\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe327 primary\n    class cwe319 secondary\n    class cwe1240 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **use of obsolete algorithms** (CWE-327). This leads to the **potential for attackers to obtain plaintext SNMPv3 credentials** (CWE-319).\n  - The **root cause** is the **obsolete algorithms** (CWE-327).\n  - The **impact** is the **potential to obtain plaintext SNMPv3 credentials** (CWE-319).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identifies CWE-327 as the primary weakness because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions the **use of obsolete algorithms**. This aligns directly with CWE-327's description. The secondary weakness, CWE-319, arises as a consequence of using these weak algorithms, leading to the **potential transmission of sensitive information in cleartext**.\n\nThe analysis relies heavily on the **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases**, specifically the **rootcause: obsolete algorithms for authentication protocol and encryption protocol** which suggests the use of weak or broken algorithms.\n\nThe graph relationships, particularly the child-of relationship between CWE-1240 and CWE-327, were considered. However, due to the lack of specific information about the cryptographic primitive used, CWE-327 was deemed more appropriate.\n\nThe selection of CWE-327 is at the optimal level of specificity given the available evidence. While more specific variants exist, they require detailed knowledge of the exact cryptographic flaws, which is not provided in the description.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
