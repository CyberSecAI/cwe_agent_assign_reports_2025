## Vulnerability Description
An issue was discovered in GitLab EE affecting all versions starting from 16.11 prior to 17.0.5, starting from 17.1 prior to 17.1.3, and starting from 17.2 prior to 17.2.1 where certain project-level analytics settings could be leaked in DOM to group members with Developer or higher roles.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** leakage of certain project-level analytics settings
- **attacker:** group members with Developer or higher roles
- **product:** GitLab EE
- **version:** all versions starting from 16.11 prior to 17.0.5 and starting from 17.1 prior to 17.1.3 and starting from 17.2 prior to 17.2.1

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `cube_api_key` is being exposed in the source code of the "Analytics dashboards" page, accessible to users with at least a "Developer" role within a GitLab project. This exposure occurs because the key is included in the rendered HTML of the page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Exposure:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of the `cube_api_key` to unauthorized users (developers and above in the project's hierarchy). This key is intended to be kept secret as it provides access to the cube.dev data source.
- **Insufficient Access Control:** The application logic does not sufficiently restrict access to sensitive information based on roles, allowing developers to access the `cube_api_key` which they shouldn't be able to see.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Data Access:** The leaked `cube_api_key` can be used by project members with the "Developer" role (or higher) to access the cube.dev data source, which could contain sensitive analytics information. This could potentially lead to data breaches, insights into sensitive information, and other misuse of the data.
- **Potential for Further Attacks:** Depending on the permissions associated with the `cube_api_key` within the cube.dev data source, an attacker might be able to perform other actions beyond just reading data such as manipulating data or gaining further access.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Browser Source Code Inspection:** The vulnerability is exploitable by simply viewing the source code of the "Analytics dashboards" page in a web browser.
- **Insider Threat:** The attacker has to be a member of a GitLab project, having at least a `Developer` role, making this an insider threat.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **GitLab Project Membership:** The attacker must be a member of a GitLab project.
- **Developer Role (or higher):** The attacker must have at least the "Developer" role within the GitLab project.
- **Access to the "Analytics dashboards" page:** The attacker must be able to access the "Analyze / Analytics dashboards" page within the project.
