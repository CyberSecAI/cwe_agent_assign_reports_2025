This vulnerability is associated with program files tinydhcpserver.C and program routines lwip_dhcp_find_option. This issue affects Advanced Software Framework through 3.52.0.2574.

This allows for a stack-based buffer overflow.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\\n- **Stack-based Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a stack buffer overflow, which occurs when the software writes data beyond the allocated buffer on the stack.\\n\\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\\n- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to remote code execution on the affected device.\\n\\n**Attack Vectors:**\\n- **Network:** The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a specially crafted DHCP request packet to a multicast address.\\n\\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\\n- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable device to send the malicious DHCP request.\\n- **Knowledge of DHCP Protocol:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious DHCP request to trigger the overflow.\\n\\n**Additional Details:**\\n- The vulnerability affects all publicly available examples of the ASF codebase and all previous versions of the software up to and including version 3.52.0.2574.\\n- Multiple forks of the tinydhcp software on Github are also potentially susceptible.\\n- The vulnerable software is no longer supported by the vendor (Microchip).\\n- The vulnerability is located in `tinydhcpserver.c` and specifically around the areas of code highlighted in the provided github links.\\n\\nThis vulnerability is particularly concerning because it is present in IoT-centric code, which means it could be present in a large number of devices.\", similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {}, 'top_cwes_by_threshold': {}}}, similarity_summary=SimilarityInsight(consensus_cwe='', top_cwes=[], confidence_levels={}, total_samples=0), analysis='', analysis_with_relationships='', criticism='', resolution='', relevant_cwes=[{'metadata': {'doc_id': '190', 'name': 'Integer Overflow or Wraparound', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product performs a calculation that can\\n         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic\\n         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than\\n         the original value.
