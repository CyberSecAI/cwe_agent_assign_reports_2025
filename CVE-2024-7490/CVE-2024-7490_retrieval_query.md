    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'Improper Input Validation'

Relevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:

### 1. CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound (Score: 310.17)

The product performs a calculation that can
         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic
         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than
         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is
         incremented to a value that is too large to st...

### 2. CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input (Score: 291.63)

The product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties....
