CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) and CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) are closely related to CWE-425. CWE-306 could be considered a prerequisite, leading to CWE-425, while CWE-862 represents a similar type of weakness.

Since the attacker is unauthenticated and can directly access the URL, CWE-425 is more appropriate than CWE-862 (Missing Authorization), which would typically apply after authentication. CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) is also a possible contributing factor, as there's likely no authentication required to access the vulnerable URL.\n\nThe selection is based on the evidence of **incorrect access control** and direct URL access.
