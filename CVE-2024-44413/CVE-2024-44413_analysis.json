  "description": "A vulnerability was discovered in DI_8200-16.07.26A1, which has been classified as critical. This issue affects the upgrade_filter_asp function in the upgrade_filter.asp file. Manipulation of the path parameter can lead to **command injection**.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:** The `upgrade_filter_asp` function in the D-Link DI-8200 firmware is vulnerable to command injection.\n\n**Vulnerabilities:**\n*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The `parm` variable, which receives the request, is not filtered. The code only checks for `http://` in the input string and does not sanitize or validate the rest.\n*   **Unsafe String Handling:** The received data is copied to `v17` using `strcpy`, and then a string is formatted into `v16` using `sprintf` without proper sanitization, before being passed to the `system()` call. This lack of sanitization enables command injection.\n*   **Direct `system()` Call:** The vulnerable code executes the constructed string directly with `system(v16)` which allows for execution of arbitrary system commands.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n*   **Remote Command Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary system commands on the device. This can lead to complete control of the router.\n*   **Data Exfiltration:**  The attacker could gain access to sensitive data stored on the router, such as network configuration details, credentials and potentially even internal network traffic.\n*   **Malware Installation:** An attacker could install malicious software on the router, turning it into part of a botnet.\n*   **Denial of Service:** The attacker could crash the router or disrupt its operation.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n*   **HTTP GET Request:**  The attack vector is an HTTP GET request to the `/upgrade_filter.asp` endpoint.\n*   **Manipulated `path` Parameter:** The `path` parameter within the GET request is used to inject malicious commands.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router.\n*   **Authentication:**  The attacker needs to have access to an active session on the device, as a valid `Cookie` is included in the provided exploit. In this case, it is shown that an authenticated user session of an administrator user (`wys_userid=admin,wys_passwd=861A198CDBD425F0B9D91C42FAB93A86`) is required.\n\n**Technical Details:**\nThe provided proof of concept (PoC) demonstrates the injection by using backticks to execute a `ps > /rce.txt` command on the router using the path parameter. This command would redirect the process list to `/rce.txt`.\n```\nGET /upgrade_filter.asp?path=http://`ps%20%3E%20/rce.txt` HTTP/1.1\n```\nThe response shows how the injected command is executed within the firmware, resulting in a new file containing the processes list.",

The vulnerability involves injecting OS commands, making CWE-78 the more appropriate choice. CWE-119 is a potential secondary weakness because the provided summary mentions the use of `strcpy` and `sprintf` without proper sanitization which could lead to buffer overflows.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n\n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe119 secondary\n    class cwe74 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **insufficient input validation**, leading to **improper neutralization of special elements**, and finally resulting in **command injection** due to the direct use of the `system()` call.\n\nInsufficient Input Validation -> Improper Neutralization (CWE-78) -> Command Execution\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment pointed towards CWE-77 based on the vulnerability description key phrases and top CWEs for similar CVE descriptions. However, the CVE Reference Links Content Summary clearly indicates that the vulnerability involves injecting OS commands, making CWE-78 the more appropriate choice. The use of `strcpy` and `sprintf` without proper sanitization points to potential buffer overflow issues which led to including CWE-119 as a secondary candidate. The selection of CWE-78 is based on the clear evidence of OS command injection. The relationship graph influenced the selection by showing how CWE-78 is a child of CWE-74, which represents the broader class of injection vulnerabilities. The chosen CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately represent the root cause and a potential contributing factor to the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Analysis**: This CWE accurately describes the vulnerability where the product fails to neutralize special elements in an OS command, leading to command injection.\n\n## CWE-790: Improper Filtering of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives data from an upstream component, but does not filter or incorrectly filters special elements before sending it to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n**Analysis**: While this CWE is relevant, it is a class-level CWE and less specific than CWE-78, which directly addresses OS command injection.\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Analysis**: This CWE is not directly related to the command injection vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-134: Use of Externally-Controlled Format String\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a function that accepts a format string as an argument, but the format string originates from an external source.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Analysis**: This CWE is not applicable as the vulnerability is command injection, not format string vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended command when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: CWE-77 is often misused when OS command injection (CWE-78) was intended instead [REF-1287].\n\n**Analysis**: This is the class-level CWE for command injection, but CWE-78 is more specific and appropriate because it is OS command injection.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n**Analysis**: This CWE is too broad and discouraged when more specific CWEs like CWE-78 are available.\n\n## CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product requires authentication, but the product has an alternate path or channel that does not require authentication.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Analysis**: This CWE is not related to the command injection vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n**Analysis**: This CWE is not directly related to the command injection vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-912: Hidden Functionality\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains functionality that is not documented, not part of the specification, and not accessible through an interface or command sequence that is obvious to the product's users or administrators.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n**Analysis**: This CWE is not related to the command injection vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n**Analysis**: This CWE is a high-level class and less specific than CWE-7",

Externally-Controlled Format String\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a function that accepts a format string as an argument, but the format string originates from an external source.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Analysis**: This CWE is not applicable as the vulnerability is command injection, not format string vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended command when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: CWE-77 is often misused when OS command injection (CWE-78) was intended instead [REF-1287].\n\n**Analysis**: This is the class-level CWE for command injection, but CWE-78 is more specific and appropriate because it is OS command injection.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n**Analysis**: This CWE is too broad and discouraged when more specific CWEs like CWE-78 are available.\n\n## CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product requires authentication, but the product has an alternate path or channel that does not require authentication.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Analysis**: This CWE is not related to the command injection vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n**Analysis**: This CWE is not directly related to the command injection vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-912: Hidden Functionality\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains functionality that is not documented, not part of the specification, and not accessible through an interface or command sequence that is obvious to the product's users or administrators.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n**Analysis**: This CWE is not related to the command injection vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n**Analysis**: This CWE is a high-level class and less specific than CWE-7\n\n\n## CWE Relationship Analysis\n\nCurrent CWEs represent these abstraction levels: .\n\n\n### Vulnerability Chain Analysis\n\n**Chain starting from CWE-288:**\n- 288 (Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel) - ROOT\n\n\n**Chain starting from CWE-7:**\n- 7 (J2EE Misconfiguration: Missing Custom Error Page) - ROOT\n\n\n\n### CWE Relationship Diagram\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n```",
