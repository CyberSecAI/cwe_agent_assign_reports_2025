# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-41806

## Vulnerability Description
The Open edX Platform is a learning management platform. Instructors can upload csv files containing learner information to create cohorts in the instructor dashboard. These files are uploaded using the django default storage. With certain storage backends, **uploads may become publicly available** when the uploader uses versions master, palm, olive, nutmeg, maple, lilac, koa, or juniper. The patch in commit cb729a3ced0404736dfa0ae768526c82b608657b ensures that cohorts data uploaded to AWS S3 buckets is written with a private ACL. Beyond patching, deployers should also ensure that existing cohorts uploads have a private ACL, or that other precautions are taken to avoid public access.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2024-41806.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how the edx-platform handles CSV file uploads for cohort creation in the instructor dashboard. Specifically, it uses Django's default storage, which, in certain storage backends like AWS S3, may not enforce private access control by default. This can lead to the uploaded files, which potentially contain sensitive learner information, becoming publicly accessible.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insecure default file storage configurations: The system relies on the default Django storage settings, which may not enforce private ACLs for uploaded files.
- Lack of access control: The vulnerability arises from the absence of explicit settings that enforce private access when storing user-uploaded CSV files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Data exposure: Public availability of CSV files containing learner data such as names, emails, or other sensitive information.
- Privacy violation: Unauthorized individuals can access and potentially misuse the exposed learner information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based: An attacker can access the publicly exposed files via the network if they are aware of the storage location.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Knowledge of the storage location: The attacker needs to discover the location where the uploaded files are stored, which may be publicly accessible URLs on S3 or similar storage backends, depending on the configuration used.
- No special privileges: The vulnerability doesn't require any specific privileges or interaction with the user.

The content also includes a commit diff that is related to a fix for library creation permissions, it is not directly related to the vulnerability in question. The commit addresses issues related to who can create a library based on user roles and settings such as "ENABLE_CREATOR_GROUP", "DISABLE_LIBRARY_CREATION", and "DISABLE_COURSE_CREATION".
