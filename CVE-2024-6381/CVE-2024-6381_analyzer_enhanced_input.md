# Vulnerability Description

    The bson_strfreev function in the MongoDB C driver library may be susceptible to an **integer overflow** where the function will try to free memory at a negative offset. This may result in **memory corruption**. This issue affected libbson versions prior to 1.26.2

    ## WEAKNESS: 'integer overflow'

Relevant CWEs for this WEAKNESS:

### 1. CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound (Score: 349.06)

The product performs a calculation that can
         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic
         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than
         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is
         incremented to a value that is too large to st...

### 2. CWE-197: Numeric Truncation Error (Score: 318.23)

Truncation errors occur when a primitive is cast to a primitive of a smaller size and data is lost in the conversion....

### 3. CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound) (Score: 314.37)

The product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result....

### 4. CWE-1285: Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input (Score: 303.39)

The product receives input that is expected to specify an index, position, or offset into an indexable resource such as a buffer or file, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the specified index/position/offset has the required properties....

### 5. CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types (Score: 301.35)

When converting from one data type to another, such as long to integer, data can be omitted or translated in a way that produces unexpected values. If the resulting values are used in a sensitive context, then dangerous behaviors may occur....

Relevant CWEs for this WEAKNESS:

### 1. CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound (Score: 349.06)

The product performs a calculation that can

### 3. CWE-823: Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset (Score: 300.91)

The product performs pointer arithmetic on a valid pointer, but it uses an offset that can point outside of the intended range of valid memory locations for the resulting pointer....

### 4. CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow (Score: 298.72)

A heap overflow condition is a buffer overflow, where the buffer that can be overwritten is allocated in the heap portion of memory, generally meaning that the buffer was allocated using a routine such as malloc()....

### 5. CWE-415: Double Free (Score: 295.82)

The product calls free() twice on the same memory address, potentially leading to modification of unexpected memory locations....
