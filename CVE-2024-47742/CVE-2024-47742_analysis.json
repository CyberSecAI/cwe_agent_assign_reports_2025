  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved firmware_loader Block **path traversal** Most firmware names are hardcoded strings, or are constructed from fairly constrained format strings where the dynamic parts are just some hex numbers or such. However, there are a couple codepaths in the kernel where firmware file names contain string components that are passed through from a device or semi-privileged userspace the ones I could find (not counting interfaces that require root privileges) are - lpfc_sli4_request_firmware_update() seems to construct the firmware filename from ModelName, a string that was previously parsed out of some descriptor (Vital Product Data) in lpfc_fill_vpd() - nfp_net_fw_find() seems to construct a firmware filename from a model name coming from nfp_hwinfo_lookup(pf->hwinfo, nffw.partno), which I think parses some descriptor that was read from the device. (But this case likely isnt exploitable because the format string looks like netronome/nic_%s, and there shouldnt be any *folders* starting with netronome/nic_. The previous case was different because there, the %s is *at the start* of the format string.) - module_flash_fw_schedule() is reachable from the ETHTOOL_MSG_MODULE_FW_FLASH_ACT netlink command, which is marked as GENL_UNS_ADMIN_PERM (meaning CAP_NET_ADMIN inside a user namespace is enough to pass the privilege check), and takes a userspace-provided firmware name.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n\nThe root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper validation of firmware file names before loading them. Specifically, the kernel's firmware loader was susceptible to path traversal attacks because it didn't reject firmware names containing \"..\" components. This allowed a malicious actor to potentially load arbitrary files as firmware by crafting a firmware filename that includes \"../\" sequences.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Path Traversal:** The primary weakness is the lack of input sanitization allowing for path traversal. By including \"..\" sequences in the firmware name, an attacker could navigate to parent directories outside of the intended firmware location.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Arbitrary File Read:** The most immediate impact is the potential for arbitrary file read. By crafting a firmware filename like \"../../../etc/shadow\", an attacker could potentially read sensitive files, including those containing system password hashes.\n*   **Privilege Escalation:** By reading files like `/etc/shadow`, an attacker could gain enough information to escalate privileges.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\nThe attack vectors are primarily through the following interfaces that pass strings from device or semi-privileged userspace into the firmware loader:\n*   **`lpfc_sli4_request_firmware_update()`**: This function constructs the firmware filename from a string called `ModelName` extracted from device descriptors.\n*   **`nfp_net_fw_find()`**: This function creates the firmware filename using a model name obtained from `nfp_hwinfo_lookup`.\n*   **`module_flash_fw_schedule()`**: This function is accessible through the `ETHTOOL_MSG_MODULE_FW_FLASH_ACT` netlink command, which allows a user with `CAP_NET_ADMIN` privileges within a user namespace to specify a firmware name.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Physical access to a device:** For exploiting `lpfc_sli4_request_firmware_update()` and `nfp_net_fw_find()`, an attacker would likely need to have some control over the device or its descriptors.\n*   **`CAP_NET_ADMIN` privilege in a user namespace:** For exploiting `module_flash_fw_schedule()`, an attacker would require `CAP_NET_ADMIN` over a network namespace with a specific type of Ethernet device mapped into it.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n*   The vulnerability was mitigated by adding a check in the firmware loader to reject any firmware names containing \"..\" components.\n*   The fix focuses on the firmware name itself and does not extend to the firmware base directory or symlink contents.\n*   The commit messages also indicate that no USB device drivers were found to be using the firmware loader in a similarly dangerous way.\n\nThis analysis is based on the provided commit logs and the vulnerability description.",

The vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"**path traversal**\" as a **weakness**. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-22, which is a Base level CWE. It is related to CWE-73 (External Control of File Name or Path), as exploitation of CWE-22 often involves external control of file names or paths. CWE-22 is a parent of CWE-23 (Relative Path Traversal), which is a more specific case of path traversal that involves the use of relative paths. Since the provided vulnerability description specifically highlights the risk of path traversal using components like \"..\", CWE-22 is the most appropriate choice.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\"]\n    cwe23[\"CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\"]\n    cwe73[\"CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\"]\n\n    cwe23 -->|CHILDOF| cwe22\n    cwe22 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe73\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe22 primary\n    class cwe23,cwe73 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the **weakness** of **path traversal** due to the lack of proper input validation in the firmware loader. The impact is that an attacker can potentially read arbitrary files, leading to privilege escalation if sensitive files like `/etc/shadow` are accessed.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is primarily based on the explicit mention of \"**path traversal**\" in the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which states: \"The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper validation of firmware file names before loading them. Specifically, the kernel's firmware loader was susceptible to path traversal attacks because it didn't reject firmware names containing \"..\" components.\"\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the selection by confirming that CWE-22 is a suitable base-level CWE that captures the essence of the path traversal vulnerability.
