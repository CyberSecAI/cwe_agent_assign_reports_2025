CWE-269, CWE-732 and CWE-250 were also considered due to privilege and permission issues. The relationships show that CWE-274 is a child of CWE-269 and peer of CWE-280.

This leads to the attacker planting a malicious binary. Upon service restart, the malicious binary is executed with elevated privileges, leading to privilege escalation.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary assessment is based on the provided evidence that the AdGuardHome binary can be overwritten by an unprivileged attacker. The **root cause** is **incorrect default permissions** (CWE-276), which allows the attacker to overwrite the binary. The impact is privilege escalation.\n\nThe following is the relevant evidence:\n- \"Root cause of vulnerability: The AdGuardHome binary can be overwritten by an unprivileged attacker, which leads to privilege escalation upon service restart.\"\n- \"Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Binary planting - the ability to overwrite the AdGuardHome binary with a malicious payload.\"\n- \"**impact:** escalate privileges\"\n- \"**vector:** overwriting AdGuardHome binary\"\n- \"**attacker:** unprivileged attackers\"\n\nCWE-276 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly describes the **incorrect permissions** that allow the binary to be overwritten.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n**CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions**\nDuring installation, installed file permissions are set to allow anyone to modify those files.\n\nThe retriever results include CWE-276 with high relevance, reinforcing this selection.\n\nCWE-269 is discouraged according to MITRE guidance, but is included because of the **privilege escalation** component.\nCWE-732 is included because of the **incorrect permission assignment** component and overwriting the binary.\nCWE-250 is included because the malicious binary is then run with **unnecessary privileges**.\n\nOther CWEs considered but not used:\n\n*   CWE-843, CWE-59, CWE-191, CWE-782, CWE-121, CWE-363: These CWEs do not accurately represent the **root cause** of the vulnerability, which is **incorrect permissions**.",
