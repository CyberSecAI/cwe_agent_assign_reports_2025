While it broadly describes the vulnerability, no specific child CWEs were clearly indicated in the provided evidence. The hierarchical relationships suggest the potential for more specific classifications, but the lack of detailed information limits the ability to refine the selection further.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    \n    class cwe200 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is relatively simple: the initial **flaw** leads directly to the **Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor**. The provided information is limited, so the chain is short.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **impact** description, \"Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\". The retriever results listed CWE-200, Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor, as a relevant candidate. After reviewing the description of CWE-200, it was determined to be the most appropriate mapping given the available information. The confidence level is moderate due to the limited details in the provided vulnerability description. The decision to use CWE-200 is heavily based on the direct match of the **impact** statement from the vulnerability description.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe
