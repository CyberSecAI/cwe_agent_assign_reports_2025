## Vulnerability Description
The Quiz And Survey Master - Best Quiz, Exam and Survey Plugin for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the question_id parameter in all versions up to, and including, 9.0.1 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**
- **weakness:** **SQL injection**
- **impact:** extract sensitive information from the database and information disclosure
- **vector:** question_id parameter
- **attacker:** authenticated attackers with contributor-level access and above
- **product:** Quiz And Survey Master - Best Quiz Exam and Survey Plugin for WordPress
- **version:** up to and including 9.0.1

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-3592:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and lack of proper SQL query preparation in the 'question_id' parameter within the Quiz And Survey Master plugin for WordPress.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in a database query, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability enables attackers to extract sensitive data from the WordPress database.
- **Potential for Further Attacks:** SQL injection can be a stepping stone for other attacks, potentially leading to complete compromise of the website if the attacker gains the ability to execute arbitrary code.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `options-page-questions-tab.php` file, specifically within the function `qsm_bulk_delete_question_from_database`.
- The attack vector is via the `question_id` parameter, which is passed as part of a POST request when deleting questions.
- The vulnerable code constructs a SQL DELETE query using unsanitized `question_id`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user.
- **Privilege Level:**  The attacker must have at least 'contributor' level privileges or higher to exploit the vulnerability

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects all versions of the Quiz And Survey Master plugin up to and including 9.0.1.
- The vulnerability was patched in version 9.0.2 by adding sanitization, proper validation, and usage of placeholders in the SQL query.
-  The provided code diff highlights changes in how the `question_id` is handled, including validation, sanitization, and use of placeholders within the SQL query.
- The fix sanitizes input, filters the IDs, and uses `wpdb->prepare` to prevent SQL injection.
