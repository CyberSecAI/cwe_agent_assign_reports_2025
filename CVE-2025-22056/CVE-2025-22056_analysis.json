  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved netfilter nft_tunnel fix geneve_opt **type confusion** addition When handling multiple NFTA_TUNNEL_KEY_OPTS_GENEVE attributes, the parsing logic should place every geneve_opt structure one by one compactly. Hence, when deciding the next geneve_opt position, the pointer addition should be in units of char *. However, the current implementation erroneously does type conversion before the addition, which will lead to heap out-of-bounds write.
