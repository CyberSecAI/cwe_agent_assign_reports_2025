# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-53242
## Query
A vulnerability has been identified in Teamcenter Visualization V14.2 (All versions < V14.2.0.14), Teamcenter Visualization V14.3 (All versions < V14.3.0.12), Teamcenter Visualization V2312 (All versions < V2312.0008), Tecnomatix Plant Simulation V2302 (All versions < V2302.0016), Tecnomatix Plant Simulation V2404 (All versions < V2404.0005). The affected applications contain an out of bounds read past the end of an allocated structure while parsing specially crafted WRL files. This could allow an attacker to execute code in the context of the current process. (ZDI-CAN-25206)

## Keyphrases
- **weakness**: 'out of bounds read past the end of an allocated structure'
