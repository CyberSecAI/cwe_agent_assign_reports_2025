  "description": "An issue was discovered on Victure RX1800 WiFi 6 Router (software EN_V1.0.0_r12_110933, hardware 1.0) devices. The TELNET service is enabled by default with admin/admin as **default credentials** and is exposed over the LAN. The allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands with root-level permissions. Device setup does not require this password to be changed during setup in order to utilize the device. (However, the TELNET password is dictated by the current GUI password.)",

Since the vulnerability description specifies the use of **default credentials** being \"admin/admin\", CWE-259 which is a variant of CWE-798 is more specific and appropriate.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe259[\"CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password\"]\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe1392[\"CWE-1392: Use of Default Credentials\"]\n\n    cwe259 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n    cwe1392 -->|PEEROF| cwe259\n    cwe306 -->|PEEROF| cwe259\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe259 primary\n    class cwe798,cwe306,cwe1392 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **use of default credentials** (CWE-259) for the Telnet service. This allows attackers to bypass authentication and execute arbitrary commands with root-level permissions.\n  - The **Primary CWE** identifies the issue that led to the vulnerability i.e. the first in the \"Vulnerability Chain\"\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment strongly points to CWE-259 (Use of Hard-coded Password) as the primary weakness. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions that the TELNET service is enabled by default with \"admin/admin\" as **default credentials**. This aligns perfectly with the definition of CWE-259. The confidence is high because the evidence is direct and the CWE is specific.\n\nCWE-1392 (Use of Default Credentials) was also considered, but CWE-259 is more specific as it identifies the **default credentials** as a password.\n\nCWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) was considered because the use of **default credentials** effectively bypasses authentication. However, the authentication mechanism is present but severely weakened by the use of **default credentials**, making CWE-259 the more accurate representation.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly address the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the use of **default credentials** for authentication. This allows attackers to gain unauthorized access and execute arbitrary commands.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n*   **CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password**\n    *   **Description**: The product contains a hard-coded password.\n    *   **Why it applies**: The Victure RX1800 WiFi 6 Router uses \"admin/admin\" as **default credentials** for its TELNET service, which allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands with root-level permissions.\n    *   **Security Implications**: Unauthorized access, arbitrary command execution, root-level compromise.\n*   **CWE-1392: Use of Default Credentials**\n    *   **Description**: The product uses default credentials, such as a default username and password, that are intended to be changed by the administrator, but are not changed.\n    *   **Why it applies**: The device setup does not require the password to be changed during setup in order to utilize the device.\n    *   **Security Implications**: Unauthorized access to the device.\n*   **CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function**\n    *   **Description**: The product does not perform any authentication for a critical function.\n    *   **Why it may apply**: Although authentication exists, the **default credentials** effectively bypass it.\n    *   **Security Implications**: Unauthorized access to critical functions.",
