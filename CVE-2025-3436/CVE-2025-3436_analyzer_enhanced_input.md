# Vulnerability Description

    The coreActivity Activity Logging for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the order and orderby parameters in all versions up to, and including, 2.7 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.

    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis
    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs.
