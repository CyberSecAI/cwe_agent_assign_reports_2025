  "reference_content": "## CVE-2025-32071: Wikibase CommonsInlineImageFormatter: i18n XSS from widthheight message via ImageHandler::getDimensionsString()\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from `ImageHandler::getDimensionsString()` using a message that returns plain text, while other similar functions return HTML and thus escape the output. This plain text output is then used directly as HTML in `CommonsInlineImageFormatter::getFileMetaHtml()`, leading to a potential XSS vulnerability.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)\n*   Insufficient output escaping\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nSuccessful exploitation could lead to XSS attacks, potentially allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts into the page.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Loading a Wikibase entity with an image statement using a specific language setting (`?uselang=x-xss`) when `$wgUseXssLanguage = true` is set.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   Ability to control the language setting used to load a Wikibase entity.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   A patch has been created and merged to fix the missing escaping in `CommonsInlineImageFormatter`. The patch is available as:\n    *   [https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/1133558](https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/1133558)\n    *   [https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/1133861](https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/1133861)\n    *   [https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/1133869](https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/1133869)\n    *   [https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/1133559](https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/1133559)\n*   A related fix was also applied to [WikibaseLocalMedia](https://github.com/ProfessionalWiki/WikibaseLocalMedia/blob/35a19d0d1b678f5540edf238c523473a145df0f6/src/Services/InlineImageFormatter.php#L139).\n*   The patch was deployed on April 1, 2025.\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   The issue was discovered and reported by Lucas Werkmeister (WMDE).\n*   The vulnerability affects the `Wikibase` extension.\n*   The task was initially blocked by merge conflicts during the 1.44.0-wmf.25 release, but was resolved by removing the patch from the deployment server.\n*   The fix also addresses a similar issue reported in [T297543](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T297543).\n*   The fix was backported to multiple MediaWiki releases (REL1\\_39, REL1\\_42, REL1\\_43).",
