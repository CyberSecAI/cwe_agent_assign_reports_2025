## Analysis of CVE-2025-2865 Content

This content is **RELEVANT** to CVE-2025-2865 and provides more detail than the placeholder description. Here's an extraction of the relevant information:

**Affected Resource:**

*   saTECH BCU, version 2.1.3

**Description:**

INCIBE has coordinated the publication of 8 vulnerabilities affecting saTECH BCU, a control and automation equipment used in electrical substations.

**Vulnerabilities & Details:**

*   **CVE-2025-2858:** Privilege escalation. An attacker with CLI access can elevate privileges to superuser using the `nice` command. (CVSS v4.0: 8.5)
*   **CVE-2025-2859:** Cookie theft. An attacker with network access can capture traffic and steal user cookies, potentially gaining access to the device with the stolen user's privileges. (CVSS v4.0: 6.9)
*   **CVE-2025-2860:** Credential Information Disclosure. Authenticated attacker can access user credentials stored in an XML file. (CVSS v4.0: 6.9)
*   **CVE-2025-2861:** Use of HTTP protocol. Sensitive data (credentials) is exchanged in plaintext, allowing attackers to intercept them. (CVSS v4.0: 6.9)
*   **CVE-2025-2862:** Weak password encryption. Attackers with access to the system or website can obtain credentials due to insufficient encryption. (CVSS v4.0: 6.9)
*   **CVE-2025-2863:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). Unauthenticated local attacker can exploit active administrator sessions to perform malicious actions (reboot, modify roles/permissions). (CVSS v4.0: 5.7)
*   **CVE-2025-2864:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). An attacker can inject malicious code into the website, impacting the victim's browser. (CVSS v4.0: 2.0)
*   **CVE-2025-2865:** Stored XSS. Allows attackers to store malicious resources on the web server, potentially impacting victim users. (CVSS v4.0: 2.4)

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Privilege escalation
*   Account compromise
*   Data theft (credentials, cookies)
*   Remote code execution (via XSS)
*   System disruption (reboot, permission changes)

**Attack Vectors:**

*   CLI access (CVE-2025-2858)
*   Network access (CVE-2025-2859)

*   Access to device's system or website (CVE-2025-2862)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   Vary depending on the vulnerability:
    *   Authenticated user (CVE-2025-2860, CVE-2025-2862)
    *   Network access (CVE-2025-2859)
    *   CLI access (CVE-2025-2858)
    *   Local unauthenticated attacker (CVE-2025-2863)
    *   Ability to inject malicious code (CVE-2025-2864, CVE-2025-2865)

**Mitigation/Fix:**

*   Upgrade to firmware version 2.2.1.

**Additional Information:**

*   The advisory was coordinated by INCIBE.
*   The vulnerabilities were discovered by Aarón Flecha Menéndez and Gabriel Vía Echezarreta.
*   The affected device is used in critical infrastructure (electrical substations).
