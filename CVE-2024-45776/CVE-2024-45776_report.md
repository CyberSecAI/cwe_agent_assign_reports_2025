# Analysis Report for CVE-2024-45776

# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-45776

## Description

When reading the language .mo file in grub_mofile_open(), grub2 fails to verify an **integer overflow** when allocating its internal buffer. A crafted .mo file may lead the buffer size calculation to overflow, leading to **out-of-bound reads** and writes. This flaw allows an attacker to leak sensitive data or overwrite critical data, possibly circumventing secure boot protections.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Weakness:** ['out-of-bound reads', 'integer overflow']
- **Impact:** ['overwrite critical data', 'leak sensitive data']
- **Vector:** crafted .mo file
- **Attacker:** attacker
- **Product:** grub2

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-190 | Integer Overflow or Wraparound | 0.9 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-125 | Out-of-bounds Read | 0.8 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |
| CWE-131 | Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size | 0.7 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The vulnerability involves an **integer overflow** (CWE-190) during buffer size calculation, leading to an **out-of-bounds read** (CWE-125). CWE-190 can precede CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), which is a parent of CWE-125. CWE-131 (Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size) is related, as the **incorrect calculation** resulting from the **integer overflow** directly contributes to the buffer size miscalculation. The primary weakness is the **integer overflow**, which then causes other issues. All selected CWEs are at the Base level of abstraction, providing appropriate granularity.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with a crafted .mo file, which causes an **integer overflow** (CWE-190) when calculating the buffer size in `grub_mofile_open()`. This leads to an **incorrect calculation of buffer size** (CWE-131), which results in an **out-of-bounds read** (CWE-125) and write. This can then lead to leaking sensitive data or overwriting critical data.

CWE-190 (Root Cause) -> CWE-131 -> CWE-125 (Impact)

## Summary of Analysis
The primary weakness is the **integer overflow** (CWE-190) during buffer size calculation. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions that the **integer overflow** leads to **out-of-bound reads** and writes. The retriever results and keyphrase analysis also support this mapping. The graph relationships show how CWE-190 can precede CWE-131 and CWE-125, fitting the vulnerability chain. Therefore, CWE-190 is the most accurate root cause, and CWE-125 and CWE-131 are secondary weaknesses that arise from the primary issue. All CWEs selected are at the Base level of abstraction, providing sufficient specificity.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-1285: Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input that is expected to specify an index, position, or offset into an indexable resource such as a buffer or file, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the specified index/position/offset has the required properties.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.
