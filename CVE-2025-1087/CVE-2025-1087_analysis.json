The vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code due to **insufficient validation of user-supplied input when processing template strings**. |\n| CWE-20 | Improper Input Validation | 0.5 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary CWE. The vulnerability stems from **insufficient validation of user-supplied input when processing template strings**. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-1336, which represents the **improper neutralization of special elements in a template engine**. CWE-94 (Code Injection) and CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) are related, as the lack of input validation leads to the ability to inject and execute arbitrary code. CWE-20 is a class-level CWE, while CWE-1336 and CWE-94 are base-level CWEs, providing more specific details about the vulnerability. CWE-1336 is selected as the primary CWE as it directly reflects the vulnerability described.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1336[\"CWE-1336: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine\"]\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    \n    cwe1336 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    cwe94 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    cwe1336 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe94\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1336 primary\n    class cwe94,cwe20 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **insufficient validation of user-supplied input when processing template strings** (CWE-1336). This leads to a **template injection vulnerability**, which allows attackers to execute arbitrary code (CWE-94).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly indicates a **template injection vulnerability** due to **insufficient validation of user-supplied input when processing template strings**. This directly aligns with CWE-1336, which describes the **improper neutralization of special elements in a template engine**. The ability to execute arbitrary code is a consequence of the template injection, leading to a secondary mapping to CWE-94. CWE-20 is a more general weakness and represents the root cause of the vulnerability and is a related secondary mapping.\n\nThe primary CWE (CWE-1336) is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly describes the **template injection** issue.\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1336: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a template engine to insert or process externally-influenced input, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements or syntax that can be interpreted as template expressions or other code directives when processed by the engine.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
