The **faulty business logic** resulted in **exposure of sensitive information** via the logging mechanism. |\n| CWE-200 | Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor | 0.6 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary candidate. This is a high-level impact, not the root cause, as information exposure is the result of the logging. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship influencing my decision is that CWE-532 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File) can lead to CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor). While CWE-200 represents the impact, CWE-532 is closer to the root cause in this specific scenario, due to the **faulty business logic** within the logging mechanism.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe532[\"CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe532 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe532 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **faulty business logic** leading to the insertion of sensitive information into the password history, which in turn exposes this sensitive information.\n\nFaulty Business Logic -> Insertion of Sensitive Information (CWE-532) -> Exposure of Sensitive Information (CWE-200)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis considered various CWEs related to sensitive information exposure and credential management. However, the root cause was identified as **faulty business logic** leading to the specific issue of sensitive information ending up in the password history and being exposed via the clear history feature.\n\nThe evidence supporting this conclusion comes from the \"**Vulnerability Description Key Phrases**\" which identifies **faulty business logic** as the root cause, and \"**CVE Reference Links Content Summary**\" which highlights \"Faulty business logic in the 'My Personal Credentials' password history component\".\n\nCWE-532 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the mechanism by which the sensitive information is exposed, which is through logging (in this case, password history). CWE-200 is more of a general impact and less descriptive of the actual flaw.\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.

In fact, it should be noted that recoverable encrypted passwords provide no significant benefit over plaintext passwords since they are subject not only to reuse by malicious attackers but also by malicious insiders.
