## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-2831 Content

Based on the provided content, this relates to a SQL injection vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The code uses string concatenation to build the SQL query, incorporating user-supplied input (`where.get("condition")` and `where.get("conditionValue")`) directly into the query without proper sanitization or parameterization. While `PreparedStatement` is used, it's not utilized correctly to prevent SQL injection. The parameters are not bound as placeholders, leading to the vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   SQL Injection
*   Improper input validation
*   Incorrect use of `PreparedStatement`

**Impact of exploitation:**

An attacker can inject malicious SQL code into the `condition` and `conditionValue` parameters, potentially allowing them to:

*   Bypass authentication
*   Read sensitive data from the database
*   Modify or delete data
*   Execute arbitrary commands on the database server (depending on database permissions)

The provided content demonstrates a time-based blind SQL injection payload (`SELECT 5645 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))xoUI`) that causes a 5-second delay, confirming the vulnerability.

**Attack vectors:**

The vulnerability is exploitable through the following URLs:

*   `https://library.mingyuefusu.top/admin/bookList?page=1&limit=10&condition=name%20AND%20(SELECT%205645%20FROM%20(SELECT(SLEEP(5)))xoUI)&conditionValue=Java`
*   `https://library.mingyuefusu.top/admin//borrowList?limit=1&page=1&condition=1%20AND%20(SELECT%205645%20FROM%20(SELECT(SLEEP(5)))xoUI)&conditionValue=1`
*   `https://library.mingyuefusu.top/reader/book?limit=1&page=1&condition=1%20AND%20(SELECT%205645%20FROM%20(SELECT(SLEEP(5)))xoUI)&conditionValue=1`
*   `https://library.mingyuefusu.top/reader/borrow?limit=1&page=1&condition=1%20AND%20(SELECT%205645%20FROM%20(SELECT(SLEEP(5)))xoUI)&conditionValue=1`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable URLs.
*   No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   **Use parameterized queries (Prepared Statements) correctly:**  Instead of concatenating strings, use placeholders in the SQL query and bind the user-supplied values to these placeholders using the `PreparedStatement`'s `setXXX()` methods (e.g., `pstmt.setString(1, where.get("condition"))`).
*   **Input validation:** Validate and sanitize all user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries.
*   **Least privilege:** Ensure the database user used by the application has only the necessary permissions.

**More detail than official CVE description:**

Yes, the content provides a detailed analysis of the vulnerability, including the vulnerable code snippet, specific attack vectors, and a demonstration of exploitation using a time-based blind SQL injection payload. This level of detail is not typically found in a standard CVE description.
