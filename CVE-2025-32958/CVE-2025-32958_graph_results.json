  "query": "Adept is a language for general purpose programming. Prior to commit a1a41b7, the remoteBuild.yml workflow file uses actions/upload-artifact@v4 to upload the mac-standalone artifact. This artifact is a zip of the current directory, which includes the automatically generated .git/config file containing the runs GITHUB_TOKEN. Seeing as the artifact can be downloaded prior to the end of the workflow, there is a few seconds where an attacker can extract the token from the artifact and use it with the Github API to push malicious code or rewrite release commits in the AdeptLanguage/Adept repository. This issue has been patched in commit a1a41b7.",
