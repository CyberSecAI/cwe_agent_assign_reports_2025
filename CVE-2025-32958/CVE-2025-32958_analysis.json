  "description": "Adept is a language for general purpose programming. Prior to commit a1a41b7, the remoteBuild.yml workflow file uses actions/upload-artifact@v4 to upload the mac-standalone artifact. This artifact is a zip of the current directory, which includes the automatically generated .git/config file containing the runs GITHUB_TOKEN. Seeing as the artifact can be downloaded prior to the end of the workflow, there is a few seconds where an attacker can extract the token from the artifact and use it with the Github API to push malicious code or rewrite release commits in the AdeptLanguage/Adept repository. This issue has been patched in commit a1a41b7.",

  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-32958 based on provided content\n\nThe provided content is **RELEVANT** to CVE-2025-32958. It details a critical vulnerability in the Adept repository related to the exposure of the `GITHUB_TOKEN`. Here's a breakdown of the information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from including the `.git/config` file, which contains the `GITHUB_TOKEN`, when creating artifacts using `actions/upload-artifact@v4`. The workflow file `remoteBuild.yml` uploads the entire current directory as a zip file, unintentionally including sensitive information.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **Insecure Artifact Creation:** The workflow doesn't filter files before creating the artifact, leading to the inclusion of sensitive data.\n*   **Exposure of Credentials:** The `GITHUB_TOKEN` is exposed within the artifact.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nAn attacker who gains access to the artifact can extract the `GITHUB_TOKEN` and use it to:\n\n*   Push malicious code to the repository.\n*   Rewrite release commits, potentially injecting backdoors into released software.\n*   Compromise the repository's integrity.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Monitoring workflow runs (specifically `remoteBuild.yml`).\n*   Downloading the artifact before the workflow completes.\n*   Extracting the `GITHUB_TOKEN` from the `.git/config` file within the artifact.\n*   Using the token with the GitHub API.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   Ability to monitor GitHub workflow runs.\n*   Ability to download GitHub artifacts.\n*   Basic understanding of the GitHub API.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   **Filter Artifact Contents:**  Only include necessary files in the artifact, excluding sensitive files like `.git/config` and environment variables. The suggested fix in the advisory is to specify the files to include instead of the current directory.\n*   The commit a1a41b7 includes changes to the `remoteBuild.yml` workflow file to remove the `.git` directory before zipping the artifact. Specifically, the lines `find stage -type d -name \".git\" -exec rm -rf {} +` and `-x \"*/.git/*\"` were added to remove the `.git` directory and exclude it from the zip archive.\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   The vulnerability affects version 2.7 of Adept and is patched in version 2.8.\n*   The CVSS score is 9.8 (Critical).\n*   CVSS v3 base metrics are provided: AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\n*   The vulnerability was reported by jackhac and nopcorn.\n*   The advisory includes a Proof of Concept (PoC) outlining the steps an attacker could take to exploit the vulnerability.",

CWE-201 was considered as a potential secondary weakness, because it is about sending sensitive information, but it does not fully capture the version control system aspect of the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe527[\"CWE-527: Exposure of Version-Control Repository to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe526[\"CWE-526: Information Exposure Through Environmental Variables\"]\n\n    cwe527 -->|CHILDOF| cwe526\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe527 primary\n    class cwe201 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper** inclusion of the `.git/config` file containing the GITHUB_TOKEN in the uploaded artifact (CWE-527). This leads to the exposure of sensitive information, which can then be exploited by an attacker to push malicious code or rewrite release commits.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-527 as the primary weakness due to the exposure of the `.git/config` file in the uploaded artifact. The analysis considered other CWEs such as CWE-201, but ultimately determined that CWE-527 best represents the specific vulnerability. The relationship analysis confirmed that CWE-527 is a variant of CWE-526, further supporting its selection. The decision is primarily based on the vulnerability description and the provided evidence from the CVE reference links content summary, which explicitly mentions the insecure artifact creation leading to the inclusion of sensitive data.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-88: Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs a string for a command to be executed by a separate component\nin another control sphere, but it does not properly delimit the\nintended arguments, options, or switches within that command string.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1286: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input that is expected to be well-formed -
