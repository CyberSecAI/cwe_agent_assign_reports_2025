  "vulnerability_info": "VulnerabilityInfo(cve_id='CVE-2024-4941', description='A ****local file inclusion** vulnerability** exists in the JSON component of gradio-app/gradio version 4.25. The vulnerability arises from **improper input validation** in the `postprocess()` function within `gradio/components/json_component.py`, where a user-controlled string is parsed as JSON. If the parsed JSON object contains a `path` key, the specified file is moved to a temporary directory, making it possible to retrieve it later via the `/file=..` endpoint. This issue is due to the `processing_utils.move_files_to_cache()` function traversing any object passed to it, looking for a dictionary with a `path` key, and then copying the specified file to a temporary directory. The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to read files on the remote system, posing a significant security risk.', key_phrases={'rootcause': ['improper input validation', 'local file inclusion vulnerability'], 'weakness': 'local file inclusion', 'impact': 'read files on the remote system', 'vector': '', 'attacker': '', 'product': 'gradio-app/gradio', 'version': '4.25', 'component': 'gradio/components/json_component.py'}, reference_content='```\\n{\\n  \"vulnerability_details\": {\\n    \"root_cause\": \"The `flag` method in `gradio/components/base.py` was not handling `JsonData` objects properly when creating the payload string for flagging.

    "enhanced_query": "# Vulnerability Description\n\n    A ****local file inclusion** vulnerability** exists in the JSON component of gradio-app/gradio version 4.25. The vulnerability arises from **improper input validation** in the `postprocess()` function within `gradio/components/json_component.py`, where a user-controlled string is parsed as JSON. If the parsed JSON object contains a `path` key, the specified file is moved to a temporary directory, making it possible to retrieve it later via the `/file=..` endpoint. This issue is due to the `processing_utils.move_files_to_cache()` function traversing any object passed to it, looking for a dictionary with a `path` key, and then copying the specified file to a temporary directory. The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to read files on the remote system, posing a significant security risk.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'improper input validation'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1.
