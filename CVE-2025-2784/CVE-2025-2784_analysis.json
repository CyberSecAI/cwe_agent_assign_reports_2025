The vulnerability description clearly indicates a **heap buffer over-read**, which directly corresponds to the characteristics of CWE-126. CWE-125, while related, is less specific and more general, describing any read beyond the intended buffer boundaries. Since the description highlights the \"over-read\" aspect, CWE-126 is a more precise classification.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe126[\"CWE-126: Buffer Over-read\"]\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n\n    cwe126 -->|CHILDOF| cwe125\n    cwe125 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe126 primary\n    class cwe125 secondary\n    class cwe119 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **heap buffer over-read** (CWE-126) in the `skip_insight_whitespace()` function, triggered by a crafted HTTP response. This leads to reading one byte out-of-bounds.\n- Root Cause: CWE-126 [Buffer Over-read]\n- Impact: Read one byte out-of-bounds\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description explicitly states a **\"heap buffer over-read\"** in the `skip_insight_whitespace()` function, making CWE-126 the most appropriate primary classification. This assessment is strongly supported by the evidence provided in the vulnerability description and CVE reference links content summary. The retriever results also lists CWE-126 as the highest-ranked CWE.\n\nThe decision to select CWE-126 is based on its direct match to the vulnerability's characteristics and its higher level of specificity compared to its parent CWE, CWE-125 [Out-of-bounds Read]. CWE-125 is included as a secondary classification because it represents the broader category of out-of-bounds read vulnerabilities. The relationship between CWE-126 and CWE-125 further solidifies the selection of CWE-126 due to its precise nature within the hierarchy.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25
