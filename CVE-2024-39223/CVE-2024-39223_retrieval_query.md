# Retrieval Query for CVE-2024-39223

## Vulnerability Description
An **authentication bypass** in the SSH service of gost v2.11.5 allows attackers to intercept communications via setting the HostKeyCallback function to ssh.InsecureIgnoreHostKey

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **authentication bypass**
- **impact:** intercept communications
- **vector:** setting HostKeyCallback function
- **attacker:** attackers
- **product:** gost
- **version:** 2.11.5
- **component:** SSH service

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the insecure configuration of the SSH client within the `gost` library. Specifically, the `HostKeyCallback` is set to `ssh.InsecureIgnoreHostKey()`, which disables host key verification during SSH connection establishment.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Missing Host Key Verification:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of host key verification during SSH connections. This bypasses a fundamental security mechanism designed to prevent man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks.
- **CWE-305:** The gist identifies this as CWE-305, which refers to "Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness." This means that the primary weakness of skipping host key verification directly leads to the ability to bypass authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** Attackers can intercept SSH connections, present a forged host key, and carry out man-in-the-middle attacks.
- **Data Theft:** Attackers can potentially steal sensitive information transmitted via the compromised SSH connection.
- **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to systems that the `gost` application connects to via SSH.
- **Malicious Actions:** Attackers can execute malicious actions on behalf of legitimate users using the compromised connection.
- **Code Execution:** The gist specifies impact code execution to true, meaning the vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Escalation of Privileges:** The gist specifies impact escalation of privileges to true, meaning the vulnerability could allow an attacker to elevate their privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Network Attack:** Attackers perform the attack remotely by intercepting the SSH connection between a `gost` client and a server.
- **MITM Position:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the client and server (i.e., be "on-path").

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Interception:** The attacker must be able to intercept network traffic between the `gost` client and the target SSH server.
- **No Special Privileges Needed:** No specific access or credentials on either the `gost` client or server are required to exploit the vulnerability, other than network access.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is located in `github.com/ginuerzh/gost/ssh.go` at line 229.
- Affected versions are `gost` <= 2.11.5
- The vulnerability affects local/remote TCP port forwarding.
- The vulnerability impacts the integrity of transmission messages.

**Suggested Solution:**
The recommended fix is to implement secure host key verification by:
- Using a known host key.
- Storing and comparing host key fingerprints against a list of trusted keys.
- Implementing a `HostKeyCallback` function that checks the host key against known or trusted keys.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation ('Algorithm Downgrade')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
A protocol or its implementation supports interaction between multiple actors and allows those actors to negotiate which algorithm should be used as a protection mechanism such as encryption or authentication, but it does not select the strongest algorithm that is available to both parties.

### Extended Description
When a security mechanism can be forced to downgrade to use a less secure algorithm, this can make it easier for attackers to compromise the product by exploiting weaker algorithm. The victim might not be aware that the less secure algorithm is being used. For example, if an attacker can force a communications channel to use cleartext instead of strongly-encrypted data, then the attacker could read the channel by sniffing, instead of going through extra effort of trying to decrypt the data using brute force techniques.

### Additional Notes
**[Other]** The main difference between the use of hard-coded passwords and the use of hard-coded cryptographic keys is the false sense of security that the former conveys. Many people believe that simply hashing a hard-coded password before storage will protect the information from malicious users. However, many hashes are reversible (or at least vulnerable to brute force attacks) -- and further, many authentication protocols simply request the hash itself, making it no better than a password.

**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-29960:** Engineering Workstation uses hard-coded cryptographic keys that could allow for unathorized filesystem access and privilege escalation
- **CVE-2022-30271:** Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) uses a hard-coded SSH private key that is likely to be used by default.
- **CVE-2020-10884:** WiFi router service has a hard-coded encryption key, allowing root access




## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

### Extended Description


By design, authentication protocols try to ensure that attackers must perform brute force attacks if they do not know the credentials such as a key or password. However, when these credentials are easily predictable or even fixed (as with default or hard-coded passwords and keys), then the attacker can defeat the mechanism without relying on brute force.


Credentials may be weak for different reasons, such as:


  - Hard-coded (i.e., static and unchangeable by the administrator)

  - Default (i.e., the same static value across different deployments/installations, but able to be changed by the administrator)

  - Predictable (i.e., generated in a way that produces unique credentials across deployments/installations, but can still be guessed with reasonable efficiency)

Even if a new, unique credential is intended to be generated for each product installation, if the generation is predictable, then that may also simplify guessing attacks.

## CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm or protocol.

### Extended Description


Cryptographic algorithms are the methods by which data is scrambled to prevent observation or influence by unauthorized actors. Insecure cryptography can be exploited to expose sensitive information, modify data in unexpected ways, spoof identities of other users or devices, or other impacts.


It is very difficult to produce a secure algorithm, and even high-profile algorithms by accomplished cryptographic experts have been broken. Well-known techniques exist to break or weaken various kinds of cryptography. Accordingly, there are a small number of well-understood and heavily studied algorithms that should be used by most products. Using a non-standard or known-insecure algorithm is dangerous because a determined adversary may be able to break the algorithm and compromise whatever data has been protected.


Since the state of cryptography advances so rapidly, it is common for an algorithm to be considered "unsafe" even if it was once thought to be strong. This can happen when new attacks are discovered, or if computing power increases so much that the cryptographic algorithm no longer provides the amount of protection that was originally thought.


For a number of reasons, this weakness is even more challenging to manage with hardware deployment of cryptographic algorithms as opposed to software implementation. First, if a flaw is discovered with hardware-implemented cryptography, the flaw cannot be fixed in most cases without a recall of the product, because hardware is not easily replaceable like software. Second, because the hardware product is expected to work for years, the adversary's computing power will only increase over time.

### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** Since CWE 4.4, various cryptography-related entries, including CWE-327 and CWE-1240, have been slated for extensive research, analysis, and community consultation to define consistent terminology, improve relationships, and reduce overlap or duplication. As of CWE 4.6, this work is still ongoing.

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-30273:** SCADA-based protocol supports a legacy encryption mode that uses Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA) in ECB mode, which leaks patterns in messages and cannot protect integrity
- **CVE-2022-30320:** Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) uses a protocol with a cryptographically insecure hashing algorithm for passwords.
- **CVE-2008-3775:** Product uses "ROT-25" to obfuscate the password in the registry.




## CWE-1393: Use of Default Password
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses default passwords for potentially critical functionality.

### Extended Description
It is common practice for products to be designed to use default passwords for authentication. The rationale is to simplify the manufacturing process or the system administrator's task of installation and deployment into an enterprise. However, if admins do not change the defaults, then it makes it easier for attackers to quickly bypass authentication across multiple organizations. There are many lists of default passwords and default-password scanning tools that are easily available from the World Wide Web.

## CWE-287: Improper Authentication
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
When an actor claims to have a given identity, the product does not prove or insufficiently proves that the claim is correct.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
authentification: An alternate term is "authentification", which appears to be most commonly used by people from non-English-speaking countries.
AuthN: "AuthN" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authentication" within the web application security community. It is also distinct from "AuthZ," which is an abbreviation of "authorization." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.
AuthC: "AuthC" is used as an abbreviation of "authentication," but it appears to used less frequently than "AuthN."

### Relationships
