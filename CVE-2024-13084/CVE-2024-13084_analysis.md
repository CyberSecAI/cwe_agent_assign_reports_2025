# Analysis for CVE-2024-13084

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-89 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship to consider is that CWE-89 is a Base level CWE, indicating it is a specific root cause. There are no parent or child relationships that influence this selection given the explicit mention of **SQL Injection** in the description.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain is straightforward: **Improper neutralization** of input leads directly to **SQL Injection**.

## Summary of Analysis
The vulnerability description clearly states the presence of **SQL injection** due to the manipulation of the `searchdata` argument in the `/admin/search-property.php` file. The retriever results also strongly suggest CWE-89 as the most appropriate mapping. Therefore, the primary CWE is CWE-89.

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component. Without sufficient removal or quoting of SQL syntax in user-controllable inputs, the generated SQL query can cause those inputs to be interpreted as SQL instead of ordinary user data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
