# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-50271

## Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved signal restore the override_rlimit logic Prior to commit d64696905554 (Reimplement RLIMIT_SIGPENDING on top of ucounts) **UCOUNT_RLIMIT_SIGPENDING rlimit was not enforced for a class of signals**. However now its enforced unconditionally, even if override_rlimit is set. This behavior change caused production issues. For example, if the limit is reached and a process receives a SIGSEGV signal, sigqueue_alloc fails to allocate the necessary resources for the signal delivery, preventing the signal from being delivered with siginfo. This prevents the process from correctly identifying the fault address and handling the error. From the user-space perspective, applications are unaware that the limit has been reached and that the siginfo is effectively corrupted. This can lead to unpredictable behavior and crashes, as we observed with java applications. Fix this by passing override_rlimit into inc_rlimit_get_ucounts() and skip the comparison to max there if override_rlimit is set. This effectively restores the old behavior.

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship influencing the CWE selection is the hierarchical relationship, specifically focusing on identifying the most appropriate level of abstraction. While several CWEs related to signal handling and resource allocation were considered, CWE-754, being a Class-level CWE, was chosen to represent the **improper check** for an exceptional condition (reaching the rlimit).

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with an **improper check** (CWE-754) for the `UCOUNT_RLIMIT_SIGPENDING` rlimit when `override_rlimit` is set. This leads to an incorrect enforcement of the limit, which in turn causes a failure to allocate resources for signal delivery. The lack of `siginfo` then results in unpredictable application behavior and crashes.
  - The **root cause** is the **improper check** for the rlimit.
  - The impact includes signal delivery failure and application crashes.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis focused on signal handler specific CWEs but evolved towards a broader categorization based on the root cause. The key evidence lies in the description stating that the `UCOUNT_RLIMIT_SIGPENDING` rlimit was enforced unconditionally, even if `override_rlimit` was set. This signifies an **improper check** for an exceptional condition.

The selection of CWE-754 is at a higher level of abstraction (Class) because the description points to a generalized lack of proper checking rather than a highly specific error like a race condition. While resource allocation issues arise, the primary issue stems from the **improper check**, making CWE-754 the most fitting root cause.

**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a signal handler that introduces a race condition.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
