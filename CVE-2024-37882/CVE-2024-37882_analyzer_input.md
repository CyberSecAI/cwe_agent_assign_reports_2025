# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-37882

## Vulnerability Description
Nextcloud Server is a self hosted personal cloud system. A recipient of a share with read&share permissions could reshare the item with more permissions. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server is upgraded to 26.0.13 or 27.1.8 or 28.0.4 and that the Nextcloud Enterprise Server is upgraded to 26.0.13 or 27.1.8 or 28.0.4.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** reshare item with more permissions
- **attacker:** recipient of share with read&share permissions
- **product:** Nextcloud Server

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-37882:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in Nextcloud's sharing mechanism, where a recipient of a shared item with "read&share" permissions could reshare the item with *more* permissions than originally granted. This indicates an issue with how Nextcloud was validating permissions when resharing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Authorization/Access Control:** The core issue is a lack of proper authorization checks when a user attempts to reshare an item. The system failed to verify if the user had the right to grant higher permissions than they themselves were given. This is a classic access control vulnerability (CWE-284).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** A user with initially limited "read&share" permission could elevate their effective permissions by resharing with others, granting them higher privileges. This could allow unauthorized users to modify or delete files that they would otherwise be unable to.
- **Potential Data Breach:** Although the specific impact is described as "Integrity: Low" and "Availability: Low",  the ability to modify data that the attacker should not have access to could potentially be a vector for data breaches and data corruption.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low Privileges:** The attacker needs to be a recipient of a shared item with "read&share" permissions. This implies having a valid user account within the Nextcloud instance and having received a share.
- **User Interaction:** The attack requires the user to take action in resharing, so "User interaction: Required".

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content includes the fix information, which references a pull request ([https://github.com/nextcloud/server/pull/44339](https://github.com/nextcloud/server/pull/44339)), and also shows that backports were applied to older stable versions of Nextcloud.
- The vulnerability is rated as "Moderate" severity, with a CVSS v3 base score of 4.6/10.
- The vulnerability affects multiple versions of both Nextcloud Server and Nextcloud Enterprise Server.
- The fix involves ensuring that share owner is used to confirm reshare permissions.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* 🔍 *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* 🔍 *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion – CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### 🔸 CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ✅ *“A user created with the ‘guest’ role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ✅ *“The backup service runs as root but only needs read access.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ⚠️ This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### 🔸 CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ✅ *“User can access another user’s invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.”*

## Mapping Examples – Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *“User can escalate privileges to admin.”*
> ❌ Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged – only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ✅ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**

| “Unauthorized read/write to file”           | Permission control issue              | CWE-285                                      |
| “Can access resource without correct role”  | Incorrect or missing permission check | CWE-285, 862, 863                            |

## Good Mapping Examples – Privileges & Permissions

* ✅ **CWE-266**: *“When a new user registers, the system assigns them admin role due to a missing role validation.”*
* ✅ **CWE-250**: *“Installer runs with system-level privileges but doesn't require them to install files in the user directory.”*
* ✅ **CWE-284**: *“Inconsistent access rules between UI and backend for sensitive endpoints.”*
* ✅ **CWE-285**: *“Authorization logic fails to restrict access to finance reports based on department.”*
