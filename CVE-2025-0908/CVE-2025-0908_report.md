# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2025-0908

## Description

PDF-XChange Editor U3D File Parsing **Out-Of-Bounds Read** **Information Disclosure Vulnerability**. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of PDF-XChange Editor. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of U3D files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-25557.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Rootcause:** lack of proper validation of user-supplied data
- **Weakness:** ['Information Disclosure Vulnerability', 'Out-Of-Bounds Read']
- **Impact:** ['Information Disclosure Vulnerability', 'disclose sensitive information', 'arbitrary code execution', 'execute arbitrary code']
- **Vector:** malicious page or open a malicious file
- **Attacker:** remote attackers
- **Product:** PDF-XChange Editor

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is CWE-125, which directly reflects the **out-of-bounds read** condition described in the vulnerability. CWE-20 is included as a secondary weakness because the root cause is the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which is a form of improper input validation and can lead to the **out-of-bounds read**.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data** (CWE-20), leading to an **out-of-bounds read** (CWE-125), which then results in an **information disclosure vulnerability**.

## Summary of Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-125 because the vulnerability description explicitly states an **Out-Of-Bounds Read**. The root cause is the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which maps to CWE-20, and is a prerequisite for the **out-of-bounds read** to occur.

The selection of CWE-125 and CWE-20 is based on the vulnerability description and the provided context. Both CWEs are at appropriate levels of abstraction. CWE-125 is a Base level CWE, representing the specific type of **out-of-bounds read**. CWE-20 is a Class level CWE, representing the generic **improper input validation** that is the root cause of the vulnerability.

**Supporting Evidence:**

*   Vulnerability Description: "PDF-XChange Editor U3D File Parsing **Out-Of-Bounds Read** **Information Disclosure Vulnerability**...The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer."
*   Keyphrase Analysis:
    *   ROOTCAUSE: '**lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**'
    *   WEAKNESS: '**Out-Of-Bounds Read**'
    *   IMPACT: 'Information Disclosure Vulnerability'

**CWEs Considered But Not Used:**

*   CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write): This CWE was considered, but the vulnerability is specifically an **out-of-bounds read**, not a write.
*   CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input): This CWE was considered, but the description doesn't specify that the improper validation is regarding the quantity in input.
*   CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow): This CWE was considered, but the description doesn't say that the buffer is allocated in the heap.
*   CWE-126 (Buffer Over-read): This CWE was considered, but it's too similar to CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) and doesn't provide additional specificity.
