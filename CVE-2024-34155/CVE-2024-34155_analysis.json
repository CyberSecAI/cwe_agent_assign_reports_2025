  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-34155:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability is caused by a stack exhaustion issue in the `go/parser` package when parsing Go source code containing deeply nested literals. Specifically, calling any of the `Parse*` functions on such code can lead to a panic due to excessive stack usage.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- Stack exhaustion vulnerability in the `go/parser` package.\n- The vulnerability lies in how the parser handles deeply nested literals during the parsing process.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- Denial of Service (DoS) - Successful exploitation leads to a panic due to stack exhaustion, effectively crashing the program or service using the vulnerable `go/parser` functionality.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- Inputting specially crafted Go source code with deeply nested literals to any function that utilizes the vulnerable `go/parser` package.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- An attacker needs to be able to provide the vulnerable application or service with the specially crafted Go source code, likely via a file or string input.\n-  No special privileges are required; a low-privileged attacker can cause a DoS.\n- The attacker needs to be able to cause the vulnerable code to call any of the parse functions (`ParseDir`, `ParseExpr`, `ParseExprFrom`, `ParseFile`).\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n- The vulnerability affects Go versions before 1.22.7 and from 1.23.0-0 before 1.23.1.\n- The fix involves tracking the depth of nested literals to prevent excessive stack consumption.\n- This issue is tracked as Go issue #69138.\n- NetApp products using the vulnerable versions of Go are also affected.\n- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3.1 score of 4.3 (Medium) with the vector `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L`",

CWE-400 **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption** is a parent of CWE-770. The selection favors CWE-674 because the vulnerability description specifically mentions **stack exhaustion** caused by deeply nested literals, which is a direct indicator of uncontrolled recursion. However, it leads to uncontrolled resource consumption. Thus, CWE-770 and CWE-400 are also considered relevant.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe674[\"CWE-674: Uncontrolled Recursion\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe789[\"CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\"]\n    \n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    cwe789 -->|CHILDOF| cwe770\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe674 primary\n    class cwe770,cwe400 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with parsing deeply nested literals, leading to **uncontrolled recursion**, which in turn causes **stack exhaustion**, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) due to a panic.\n  - **Root Cause:** Deeply nested literals leading to **uncontrolled recursion** (CWE-674)\n  - **Weakness:** **Stack exhaustion** due to uncontrolled resource allocation (CWE-770, CWE-400)\n  - **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) via program panic\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability based on the provided description and CVE reference.
