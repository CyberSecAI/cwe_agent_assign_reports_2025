## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability in the Cisco AnyConnect VPN server of Cisco Meraki MX and Cisco Meraki Z Series Teleworker Gateway devices could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a DoS condition in the AnyConnect service on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to **insufficient resource management when establishing TLS/SSL sessions**. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of crafted TLS/SSL messages to the VPN server of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the Cisco AnyConnect VPN server to stop accepting new connections, preventing new SSL VPN connections from being established. Existing SSL VPN sessions are not impacted. Note When the attack traffic stops, the Cisco AnyConnect VPN server recovers gracefully without requiring manual intervention.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2024-20500:

**Root Cause:** Insufficient resource management when establishing TLS/SSL sessions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   The vulnerability stems from inadequate handling of resources during the establishment of TLS/SSL sessions within the Cisco AnyConnect VPN server on Cisco Meraki MX and Z Series Teleworker Gateway devices.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   A successful exploit allows an attacker to cause the Cisco AnyConnect VPN server to stop accepting new connections.
*   This results in the prevention of new SSL VPN connections from being established.
*   Existing SSL VPN sessions remain unaffected.
*   The AnyConnect VPN server recovers gracefully after the attack traffic ceases without requiring manual intervention.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability.
*   The attack vector involves sending a series of crafted TLS/SSL messages to the vulnerable VPN server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker does not need any prior authentication.
*   The attacker can be remote and unauthenticated.
*   The attacker needs the ability to send specially crafted TLS/SSL messages.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is specific to devices that have the Cisco AnyConnect VPN service enabled.
*   Devices using only L2TP/IPsec are not vulnerable.
*   The severity is rated as Medium with a CVSS base score of 5.8.
*   Cisco Meraki has released software updates to address this vulnerability.
*   There are no workarounds other than disabling AnyConnect VPN to mitigate the risk.
