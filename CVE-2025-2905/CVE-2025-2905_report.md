# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2025-2905

## Description

An XML External Entity (**XXE**) vulnerability exists in the gateway component of WSO2 API Manager due to **insufficient validation of XML input in crafted URL paths**. User-supplied XML is parsed without appropriate restrictions, enabling external entity resolution. This vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated remote attacker to read files from the servers filesystem or perform denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. * On systems running JDK 7 or early JDK 8, full file contents may be exposed. * On later versions of JDK 8 and newer, only the first line of a file may be read, due to improvements in XML parser behavior. * DoS attacks such as Billion Laughs payloads can cause service disruption.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Component:** gateway component
- **Rootcause:** insufficient validation of XML input in crafted URL paths
- **Vector:** crafted URL paths
- **Weakness:** XXE
- **Product:** WSO2 API Manager
- **Impact:** Billion Laughs payloads, denial-of-service, read files from the servers filesystem, service disruption
- **Attacker:** unauthenticated remote attacker

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-611 | Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference | 1.0 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-776 | Improper Restriction of Recursive Entity References in DTDs ('XML Entity Expansion') | 0.7 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that influenced the selection was that CWE-611 is a Base level CWE, which is preferred for mapping. CWE-776 was considered a secondary CWE because the vulnerability description mentions "Billion Laughs" attacks, which are related to XML entity expansion. Both CWE-611 and CWE-776 are related to improper handling of XML structures.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **insufficient validation of XML input**, leading to an **XXE** vulnerability. This allows an attacker to read files from the server's filesystem or perform denial-of-service attacks.

## Summary of Analysis
The primary CWE identified is CWE-611 (Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference), based on the vulnerability description which explicitly mentions an **XXE** vulnerability due to **insufficient validation of XML input**. The retriever results also list CWE-611 as the top candidate with a score of 1.0. The vulnerability description states that "User-supplied XML is parsed without appropriate restrictions, enabling external entity resolution," which aligns directly with the definition of CWE-611.

CWE-776 (Improper Restriction of Recursive Entity References in DTDs ('XML Entity Expansion')) is considered as a secondary CWE since the description mentions "DoS attacks such as Billion Laughs payloads can cause service disruption". Billion Laughs is a type of XML entity expansion attack.

CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) was considered, but it is a Class-level CWE and the vulnerability description provides enough detail to use the more specific Base-level CWE-611. Therefore, CWE-20 is not selected.

The selection of CWE-611 and CWE-776 is based on direct evidence from the vulnerability description and the retriever results. These CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity (Base) and accurately represent the weaknesses described in the vulnerability.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.81
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product processes an XML document that can contain XML entities with URIs that resolve to documents outside of the intended sphere of control, causing the product to embed incorrect documents into its output.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-776: Improper Restriction of Recursive Entity References in DTDs ('XML Entity Expansion')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses XML documents and allows their structure to be defined with a Document Type Definition (DTD), but it does not properly control the number of recursive definitions of entities.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-112: Missing XML Validation
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product accepts XML from an untrusted source but does not validate the XML against the proper schema.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as "<", ">", and "&" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-917: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of an expression language (EL) statement in a framework such as a Java Server Page (JSP) using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended EL statement before it is executed.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.



## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.
