Several other CWEs are related, particularly those dealing with resource management such as CWE-772 (Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime) and CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling). However, without more information, it is difficult to determine the exact nature of the resource **uncontrolled consumption**. CWE-400 is a general class encompassing various resource-related issues.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe772[\"CWE-772: Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    \n    cwe772 -->|CHILDOF| cwe404[\"CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\"]\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    cwe400 -->|PARENT_OF| cwe770\n    cwe404 -->|PARENT_OF| cwe772\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe400 primary\n    class cwe772,cwe770 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **uncontrolled resource consumption** (CWE-400) leading to a denial of service. The specific type of resource consumption isn't detailed, so we cannot map further.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description explicitly states **\"uncontrolled resource consumption\"** as the **rootcause**, which directly maps to CWE-400. The impact is a denial of service. The provided information is limited, preventing a more specific mapping.\n\nThe retriever results also listed CWE-400 as the top candidate. While more specific CWEs like CWE-772 (Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime) and CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) were considered, the lack of detail in the description prevents confidently assigning them.\n\nCWE-400 is selected because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions uncontrolled resource consumption. The evidence strength is moderate because the description doesn't provide further details on the nature of the resource or the mechanism of consumption. The confidence score is 0.75, reflecting the direct match with the description but acknowledges the lack of deeper context.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not maintain or incorrectly maintains control over a resource throughout its lifetime of creation, use, and release.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is high-level when lower-level children are available.\n\n\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification)\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly control situations in which an adversary can cause the product to consume or produce excessive resources without requiring the adversary to invest equivalent work or otherwise prove authorization, i.e., the adversary's influence is \"asymmetric.\"\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-772: Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release a resource after its effective lifetime has ended, i.e., after the resource is no longer needed.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-410: Insufficient Resource Pool\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product's resource pool is not large enough to handle peak demand, which allows an attacker to prevent others from accessing the resource by using a (relatively) large number of requests for resources.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource, thereby enabling an actor to influence the amount of resources consumed, eventually leading to the exhaustion of available resources.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-400 is intended for incorrect behaviors in which the product is expected to track and restrict how many resources it consumes, but CWE-400 is often misused because it is conflated with the \"technical impact\" of vulnerabilities in which resource consumption occurs.
