# Enhanced Analysis for CVE-2024-50341

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE - The root cause is the absence of authentication for a critical function (login). |
| CWE-863 | Incorrect Authorization | 0.7 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary Candidate - The `user_checker` is part of the authorization process, and it's not being called. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-306 **Missing Authentication for Critical Function**, as the `user_checker` is not being called during login, which is a critical function that should require authentication/authorization checks. CWE-863 **Incorrect Authorization** is a closely related class-level CWE. It is considered because the `user_checker` is part of the authorization process, and it's not functioning as intended.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **missing call** to the `user_checker` during the `Security::login` method, which leads to a bypass of authentication/authorization checks, and ultimately results in **unwanted login**.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment identified CWE-306 **Missing Authentication for Critical Function** as the primary root cause, supported by the vulnerability description, which states that the custom `user_checker` is not called during login. The retriever results also suggested CWE-306. The CVE reference content summary supports this by stating that the `Security::login` method did not call the custom `user_checker`. The relationship analysis showed that CWE-863 **Incorrect Authorization** could also be a secondary candidate since it is a related class-level CWE, and the `user_checker` is part of the authorization process. The final decision is based on the evidence that the `user_checker` is not called, which means authentication/authorization checks are missing for a critical function (login). CWE-306 **Missing Authentication for Critical Function** is at the optimal level of specificity (Base).

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product generates an error message that includes sensitive information about its environment, users, or associated data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product requires authentication, but the product has an alternate path or channel that does not require authentication.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
According to WASC, "Insufficient Session Expiration is when a web site permits an attacker to reuse old session credentials or session IDs for authorization."

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.

## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 686.92
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 680.83
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.

**Mapping Guidance**:
