  "description": "symfony/security-bundle is a module for the Symphony PHP framework which provides a tight integration of the Security component into the Symfony full-stack framework. The custom `user_checker` defined on a firewall is not called when Login Programmaticaly with the `Securitylogin` method, leading to **unwanted login**. As of versions 6.4.10, 7.0.10 and 7.1.3 the `Securitylogin` method now ensure to call the configured `user_checker`. All users are advised to upgrade.

CWE-863 **Incorrect Authorization** is a closely related class-level CWE. It is considered because the `user_checker` is part of the authorization process, and it's not functioning as intended.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe306 -->|PEEROF| cwe863\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe306 primary\n    class cwe863 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing call** to the `user_checker` during the `Security::login` method, which leads to a bypass of authentication/authorization checks, and ultimately results in **unwanted login**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-306 **Missing Authentication for Critical Function** as the primary root cause, supported by the vulnerability description, which states that the custom `user_checker` is not called during login. The retriever results also suggested CWE-306. The CVE reference content summary supports this by stating that the `Security::login` method did not call the custom `user_checker`. The relationship analysis showed that CWE-863 **Incorrect Authorization** could also be a secondary candidate since it is a related class-level CWE, and the `user_checker` is part of the authorization process. The final decision is based on the evidence that the `user_checker` is not called, which means authentication/authorization checks are missing for a critical function (login). CWE-306 **Missing Authentication for Critical Function** is at the optimal level of specificity (Base).\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified
