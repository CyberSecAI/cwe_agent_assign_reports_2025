Specific impact varies case by case.\n- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through a crafted request that a logged-in user would unknowingly execute.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user with sufficient privileges into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious site. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to initiate the attack.",

The **XSS** is a consequence of this **lack of protection**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n- **CWE-352**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) - This is the root cause of the vulnerability, as the **lack of CSRF protection** allows unauthorized requests to be made.\n- **CWE-79**: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') - This is a secondary weakness, as the **lack of CSRF protection** allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts.\n\n**CWE-80** (Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)) was considered because the vulnerability is Stored **XSS**. However, **CWE-79** is more appropriate because it describes the general case of improper neutralization of input during web page generation, whereas **CWE-80** focuses specifically on script-related HTML tags.
