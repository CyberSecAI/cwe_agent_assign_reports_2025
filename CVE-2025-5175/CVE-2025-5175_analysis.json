  "description": "A vulnerability was found in erdogant pypickle up to 1.1.5. It has been classified as critical. This affects the function Save of the file pypickle/pypickle.py. The manipulation leads to **improper authorization**. Attacking locally is a requirement. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. Upgrading to version 2.0.0 is able to address this issue. The patch is named 14b4cae704a0bb4eb6723e238f25382d847a1917. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component.",

  "reference_content": "**CVE-2025-5175 Analysis**\n\nBased on the provided content, this relates to a file overwrite vulnerability in the `pypickle` library. Here's a breakdown of the information:\n\n*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient validation of the file path in the `save()` function when the `overwrite` parameter is set to `True`. This allows attackers to overwrite arbitrary files.\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Path traversal vulnerability, insufficient input validation.\n*   **Impact of exploitation:** Data loss, corruption of critical files, potential security vulnerabilities, system instability, and execution of malicious payloads.\n*   **Attack vectors:** An attacker can control the `filepath` input to the `save()` function to overwrite files.\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to control the input to the `save()` function, meaning they need to be able to execute code that calls this function with a malicious filepath.\n*   **Mitigation or fix:**\n    *   Sanitize file paths to prevent directory traversal (e.g., checking for \"..\").\n    *   Restrict file paths to a specific, safe directory.\n    *   Implement improved file existence checks and potentially require user confirmation before overwriting files.\n    *   Log file overwrites, especially in sensitive directories.\n\nThe provided content includes a proof-of-concept exploit demonstrating how to overwrite files using relative paths.\n\n**Note:** The release notes for version 2.0.0 indicate that significant security mechanisms have been added to address this and other vulnerabilities, including restrictions on saving files outside of home/temp directories and validation of modules during loading. However, the initial vulnerability existed prior to this release.",

CWE-73 is a secondary CWE related to external control of file paths, which contributes to the vulnerability's exploitability. The relationship between them isn't directly hierarchical or part of a strict chain, but they are related in the context of the vulnerability. CWE-862 is a base-level CWE, providing a detailed description of the vulnerability. CWE-73 is also a base-level CWE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe73[\"CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe73 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with **insufficient validation** of the file path in the `save()` function, leading to missing authorization checks (CWE-862). This allows for external control of the file path (CWE-73), ultimately resulting in arbitrary file overwrite and potential execution of malicious payloads.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on the **improper authorization** reported in the vulnerability description. The CVE reference link content summary provided additional details about the root cause, specifically the **insufficient validation** of the file path and potential path traversal.\n\nThe primary selection is CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) because the vulnerability allows unauthorized file overwrites due to the absence of proper access controls. This aligns with the provided guidance distinguishing authentication vs. authorization issues and the retriever results.\n\nCWE-73 (External Control of File Name or Path) is considered a secondary factor because the attacker can control the file path to overwrite arbitrary files. This is facilitated by the initial lack of authorization.\n\nThe selection is based on the evidence of **insufficient validation** allowing unauthorized file overwrites.

Alternately, if the weakness occurs in a privileged program, it could allow the attacker to specify commands that normally would not be accessible, or to call alternate commands with privileges that the attacker does not have. The problem is exacerbated if the compromised process does not follow the principle of least privilege, because the attacker-controlled commands may run with special system privileges that increases the amount of damage.\n\n\nThere are at least two subtypes of OS command injection:\n\n\n  - The application intends to execute a single, fixed program that is under its own control. It intends to use externally-supplied inputs as arguments to that program. For example, the program might use system(\"nslookup [HOSTNAME]\") to run nslookup and allow the user to supply a HOSTNAME, which is used as an argument. Attackers cannot prevent nslookup from executing. However, if the program does not remove command separators from the HOSTNAME argument, attackers could place the separators into the arguments, which allows them to execute their own program after nslookup has finished executing.\n\n  - The application accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run, as well as which commands to use. The application simply redirects this entire command to the operating system. For example, the program might use \"exec([COMMAND])\" to execute the [COMMAND] that was supplied by the user. If the COMMAND is under attacker control, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or programs. If the command is being executed using functions like exec() and CreateProcess(), the attacker might not be able to combine multiple commands together in the same line.\n\nFrom a weakness standpoint, these variants represent distinct programmer errors. In the first variant, the programmer clearly intends that input from untrusted parties will be part of the arguments in the command to be executed. In the second variant, the programmer does not intend for the command to be accessible to any untrusted party, but the programmer probably has not accounted for alternate ways in which malicious attackers can provide input.",
