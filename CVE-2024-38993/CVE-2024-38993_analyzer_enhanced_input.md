## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in the advisory:

**Vulnerability:** Prototype Pollution in `@jsonic/jsonic-next` version 2.12.1

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of the `__proto__` property within several utility functions: `empty`, `util.clone`, `util.prop`, `util.deep`, and `make`. These functions fail to prevent modification of the `Object.prototype`, leading to prototype pollution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The affected utility functions directly manipulate object properties without proper sanitization or validation.
- They allow an attacker to inject the `__proto__` property which can overwrite properties in the prototype chain.
- The vulnerability is present in internal, undocumented utility functions which, while not the primary API, are still exploitable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Modifying `Object.prototype` can potentially lead to:
    - Denial of service (DoS): by changing how objects behave, it could crash the application
    - Remote code execution (RCE): if an application relies on the prototypeâ€™s values for decision making or execution
    - Cross-site scripting (XSS): if application outputs polluted data
- The actual impact depends on how the application utilizes objects and the modifications made by an attacker.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker crafts a malicious input that includes the `__proto__` property.
- This malicious input is passed as an argument to any of the vulnerable utility functions (`empty`, `util.clone`, `util.prop`, `util.deep`, `make`).
- The utility functions process the malicious input, leading to changes in the `Object.prototype`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to control the input to one of the vulnerable functions.
- This may be possible through the application's API which relies on these functions, although the advisory does not specify this.
- The provided PoC shows it is possible to directly exploit the vulnerable functions if they can be called.

**Additional Notes:**
- The advisory includes a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) demonstrating how the vulnerability can be exploited.
- The package vendor, `rjrodger`, claims the functions are internal and undocumented, however, the functions are still vulnerable.
- The CVSS score is 9.8 CRITICAL, indicating the severity of the potential impact.
