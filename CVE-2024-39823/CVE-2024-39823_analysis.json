This is an information disclosure vulnerability, meaning it does not allow for modification or denial of service.\n*   **Attack Vector:** Network access is required to exploit the vulnerability.\n*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n    *   The attacker must be a privileged user within the Zoom environment.\n    *   The attacker needs network access to the affected system.\n*   **Affected Products:** A wide range of Zoom products are affected across different operating systems, all versions prior to 6.1.0 (or 6.0.11 for Zoom Workplace VDI Client for Windows, excluding 5.17.14). This includes:\n    *   Zoom Workplace Desktop App (Windows, macOS, Linux)\n    *   Zoom Workplace App (iOS, Android)\n    *   Zoom Workplace VDI Client for Windows\n    *   Zoom Meeting SDK (Windows, macOS, iOS, Android)\n    *   Zoom Rooms Client (Windows, macOS, iPad)\n    *   Zoom Rooms Controller (Windows, macOS, Linux, Android)\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n*   The vulnerability was reported by Zoom Offensive Security.\n*   The CVSS score is 4.9, with a vector string of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N, indicating a medium severity vulnerability that is remotely exploitable, requires high privileges, no user interaction and results in high confidentiality impact.\n*   The recommended mitigation is to update the affected applications to the latest versions available on the Zoom download page: [https://zoom.us/download](https://zoom.us/download)\n\nThis content provides more specific information than the typical CVE description by listing the specific products and versions affected.",

However, the provided information does not give enough detail to select a more specific child CWE. The retriever results also showed many potential base CWEs but none were definitive. Therefore, the analysis relies on the class-level CWE-200 for its broad applicability to the sensitive information exposure.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    \n    class cwe200 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an unspecified weakness within the Zoom product's code that results in sensitive information being exposed to a privileged user via network access. The root cause is unspecified. The impact is **sensitive information disclosure**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-200 as the most relevant CWE based on the vulnerability description stating \"**Sensitive information disclosure**\".\n\nThe vulnerability description explicitly states \"Sensitive information disclosure...may allow a privileged user to conduct an information disclosure via network access.\" This directly aligns with the description of CWE-200 which states \"The product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.\"\n\nThe confidence level is high (0.9) because the description clearly indicates sensitive information disclosure, which is the core characteristic of CWE-200. While the description mentions network access and privileged users, these are contextual details about the attack vector and attacker capabilities, rather than specific coding errors.\n\nOther CWEs Considered:\n\n*   CWE-126 (Buffer Over-read): While buffer over-reads can lead to information disclosure, there's no evidence of a buffer handling issue in the description.\n*   CWE-284 (Improper Access Control): Access control issues could lead to information disclosure, but the description doesn't specify an access control **failure**, only that a privileged user is involved.\n*   CWE-321 (Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key), CWE-259 (Use of Hard-coded Password): There's no indication of cryptographic keys or passwords being involved.\n*   CWE-250 (Execution with Unnecessary Privileges): While a privileged user exploits the vulnerability, the root cause isn't necessarily related to unnecessary privileges.\n*   CWE-287 (Improper Authentication): The vulnerability description doesn't indicate any issues with authentication.\n*   CWE-248 (Uncaught Exception): There's no evidence of uncaught exceptions.\n*   CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data): This is more specific than the general disclosure described.\n*   CWE-213 (Exposure of Sensitive Information Due to Incompatible Policies): There's no evidence of incompatible policies.\n\nThe selection of CWE-200 is at the optimal level of specificity because the vulnerability description lacks specific details about the underlying cause of the information disclosure. Therefore, a more specific CWE cannot be selected.",
