# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-12601

## Vulnerability Description
The Calculated Fields Form plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Denial of Service in all versions up to, and including, 5.2.63. This is due to unlimited height and width parameters for CAPTCHA images. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to send multiple requests with large values, resulting in slowing server resources if the server does not mitigate Denial of Service attacks.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** Denial of Service attacks
- **vector:** multiple requests with large values
- **attacker:** unauthenticated attackers
- **product:** Calculated Fields Form plugin for WordPress
- **version:** all versions up to and including 5.2.63

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
**Vulnerability:** Denial of Service (DoS)

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to the lack of input sanitization and validation for the height and width parameters used to generate CAPTCHA images. The plugin doesn't impose any limit on the size of the image requested.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
  - Uncontrolled Resource Consumption
  - Lack of Input sanitization
  - Lack of input validation

**Impact of Exploitation:**
  - An unauthenticated attacker can cause a denial of service condition by sending multiple requests with arbitrarily large values for the CAPTCHA image width and height parameters, resulting in resource exhaustion (CPU, Memory, etc.) on the server and potentially crashing the service.

**Attack Vectors:**
  - HTTP GET requests with manipulated parameters

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
  - Unauthenticated access to the web server.
  - Ability to send HTTP requests.
