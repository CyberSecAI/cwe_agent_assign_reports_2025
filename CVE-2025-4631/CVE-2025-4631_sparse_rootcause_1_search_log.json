  "query": "The Profitori plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation due to a missing capability check on the stocktend_object endpoint in versions 2.0.6.0 to 2.1.1.3. This makes it possible to trigger the save_object_as_user() function for objects whose _datatype is set to users,. This allows unauthenticated attackers to write arbitrary strings straight into the users wp_capabilities meta field, potentially elevating the privileges of an existing user account or a newly created one to that of an administrator.",
