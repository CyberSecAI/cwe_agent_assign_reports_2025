## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain consists of:
1.  **Root Cause:** CWE-89 - Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') due to the manipulation of the 'eid' argument in the `/art-enquiry.php` file.
2.  **Impact:** Unauthorized data access/modification (inferred).

## Summary of Analysis
The vulnerability description clearly states that the manipulation of the `eid` argument leads to **SQL Injection**. The description aligns perfectly with CWE-89, which describes the **improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL command**. The retriever results also confirm that CWE-89 is the top candidate for this vulnerability.

The evidence supporting this classification is found in the vulnerability description: "The manipulation of the argument eid leads to **sql injection**." This statement directly indicates the presence of an **SQL Injection** vulnerability.

The selection of CWE-89 is at the optimal level of specificity as it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability.
