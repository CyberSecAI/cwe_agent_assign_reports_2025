# Raw Analyzer Response for CVE-2025-48207

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-639 | Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE. The application **fails to validate** the *downloaduid* parameter and an attacker can use a crafted *downloaduid* parameter to download any files. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship influencing the decision is the direct match of the vulnerability to the description of CWE-639. There are no other hierarchical or chain relationships that are relevant based on the provided information. The abstraction level is Base, which is the preferred level of abstraction.

```

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain is simple:

1.  **Root Cause:** **Insecure Direct Object Reference** due to **failure to validate** the *downloaduid* parameter (CWE-639).
2.  **Impact:** An unauthenticated attacker can download any files available in the system.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is based on the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which both explicitly mention **Insecure Direct Object Reference** and the **failure to validate** the *downloaduid* parameter. This aligns directly with the description of CWE-639, "Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key," where a user-controlled key (*downloaduid*) is used to bypass authorization and access resources. The retriever results also list CWE-639 as the top candidate with a score of 1.0. CWE-639 is at the Base level of abstraction, which is ideal.
