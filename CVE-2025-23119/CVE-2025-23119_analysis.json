CWE-78 is included as a related injection weakness, and CWE-294 is included as a possible impact stemming from the root cause. The abstraction levels were considered to ensure that the most specific and relevant CWEs were selected.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe150[\"CWE-150: Improper Neutralization of Escape, Meta, or Control Sequences\"]\n    cwe138[\"CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\"]\n    cwe294[\"CWE-294: Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay\"]\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n\n    cwe150 -->|CHILDOF| cwe138\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe150 primary\n    class cwe294,cwe78 secondary\n    class cwe138 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **Improper Neutralization of Escape Sequences** (CWE-150), which leads to Authentication Bypass (CWE-294) and Remote Code Execution (RCE).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **Improper Neutralization of Escape Sequences** as the root cause. The selection of CWE-150 is based on the **rootcause** explicitly mentioned in the Vulnerability Description Key Phrases.\n\nThe retriever results suggested CWE-138 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements), but since the description specifies \"Escape Sequences\", CWE-150 (Improper Neutralization of Escape, Meta, or Control Sequences), a variant of CWE-138, is a more precise fit.\n\nCWE-78 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')) is considered because RCE is mentioned, and escape sequence issues can potentially lead to command injection. However, without further details, it is a less confident mapping.\n\nCWE-294 (Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay) is also considered since the vulnerability results in an authentication bypass. However, it is classified as a secondary candidate because the root cause is the **improper neutralization** rather than the bypass mechanism itself.\n\nThe evidence is primarily the explicit mention of \"Improper Neutralization of Escape Sequences\" in the vulnerability description.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
