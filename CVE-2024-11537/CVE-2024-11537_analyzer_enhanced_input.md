## Vulnerability Description
IrfanView DXF File Parsing **Out-Of-Bounds Read** Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of IrfanView. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of DXF files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-24620.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the insufficient validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of DXF files within IrfanView. This lack of validation allows for a read operation past the end of an allocated buffer.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The core weakness is an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. This occurs because the software does not properly check the size or validity of data being read from the DXF file, potentially accessing memory outside the intended buffer.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current IrfanView process. This means the attacker could gain control over the user's system, install malware, or steal sensitive information.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector involves a malicious DXF file. The user must either open this file directly or visit a malicious web page that triggers the vulnerability by loading the file.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious DXF file to exploit this vulnerability. They also need to convince a user to open this file or visit a site hosting it. Since the CVSS score includes "User Interaction" (UI:R), the attacker cannot exploit the vulnerability without the user taking some action.

The information provided here is more detailed than the basic description in the CVE placeholder, providing specifics on the vulnerable file type (DXF), the type of memory corruption (out-of-bounds read), and the impact (remote code execution).
