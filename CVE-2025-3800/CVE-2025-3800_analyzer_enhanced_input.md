## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-3800 Content

Based on the provided content, this relates to a vulnerability report and **is relevant** to a potential CVE. The content details a SQL injection vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper filtering of the `mobile_phone` parameter in the `anonymous/setlogin` interface of WCMS11. The backend SQL queries are constructed by string concatenation without parameter sanitization, specifically within `lib/Db.php`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   SQL Injection

**Impact of exploitation:**

Successful exploitation could lead to website intrusion and data theft.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The `mobile_phone` parameter in a POST request to the `anonymous/setlogin` interface (`http://wcms.com/index.php?anonymous/setlogin`).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to send a crafted POST request to the vulnerable endpoint. No authentication is required as the interface is `anonymous`.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   Thoroughly filter the `mobile_phone` parameter.
*   Use prepared statements for backend SQL queries to avoid direct parameter concatenation.

**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**

*   **Affected Product:** WCMS11
*   **Product Supplier:** <https://gitee.com/wcms/WCMS>
*   **Code Location:** `app/controllers/AnonymousController.php#setLogin`, `app/service/MemberService.php`, `lib/Db.php`
*   **Proof of Concept:** A sample POST request is provided.
