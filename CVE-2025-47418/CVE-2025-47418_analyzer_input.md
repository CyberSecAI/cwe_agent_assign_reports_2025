The provided content details updates and release notes for Crestron's Automate VX software. It describes new features, fixed issues, and known issues across multiple versions (6.4.1.8 down to 5.6.8161.21536).

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information, specifically addressing security-related fixes:

**CVE-2025-20821:**

*   **Root cause:** Not explicitly stated, but resolved by defaulting to secure HTTPS connections in the web configuration interface and API.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use of insecure HTTP connections.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Potential for man-in-the-middle attacks, eavesdropping, and credential theft.
*   **Attack vectors:** Network interception.
*   **Mitigation or fix:**  Defaulting to HTTPS connections. Legacy mode is enabled by default on updates, but can be disabled. New installations do not support legacy mode.

**CVE-2025-20819 & CVE-2025-20820:**

*   **Root cause:** Not explicitly stated.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Not explicitly stated.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Not explicitly stated.
*   **Attack vectors:** Not explicitly stated.
*   **Mitigation or fix:** Added overlays to program video output to identify when recordings or Debug Mode are enabled.

**CVE-2025-20822:**

*   **Root cause:** Not explicitly stated.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Permissions were not applied to API commands.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthorized access to API functionality.
*   **Attack vectors:** API access.
*   **Mitigation or fix:** Applied permissions to API commands.

**Additional Security-Related Notes:**

*   **OpenSSL Upgrade:** Several releases mention upgrading OpenSSL (e.g., from 3.0.11 to 3.0.13), which addresses known vulnerabilities in older OpenSSL versions.
*   **NVIDIA Driver Updates:** Version 6.2.1.18 includes updates to NVIDIA drivers to mitigate known NVIDIA security issues (link provided to NVIDIA's security advisories).
*   **Password Requirements:** Increased minimum password requirements for the web UI.
*   **API Security:** New API support features were added, and security considerations were likely part of their implementation.
