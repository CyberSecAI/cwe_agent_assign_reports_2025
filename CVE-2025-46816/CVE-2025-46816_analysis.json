  "description": "goshs is a SimpleHTTPServer written in Go. Starting in version 0.3.4 and prior to version 1.0.5, running goshs without arguments makes it possible for anyone to execute commands on the server. The function `dispatchReadPump` does not checks the option cli `-c`, thus allowing anyone to execute arbitrary command through the use of websockets. Version 1.0.5 fixes the issue.",

Verification:**\n\nThe content directly references CVE-2025-46816 and details a security vulnerability in the `goshs` project. Therefore, it is relevant to the specified CVE.\n\n**2. Extracted Information:**\n\n*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `dispatchReadPump` function in `ws/client.go` does not check for the `-c` cli option, allowing arbitrary command execution via websockets.\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of input validation/sanitization, specifically regarding command execution triggered through websocket messages.  The CWE identified is CWE-284: Improper Access Control.\n*   **Impact of exploitation:**  Allows anyone to execute commands on the server running a vulnerable version of `goshs`. This could lead to complete system compromise (High Confidentiality, High Integrity, Low Availability).\n*   **Attack vectors:**  Exploitation occurs via sending a JSON payload containing a command through a websocket connection to the `goshs` server.  The provided PoC uses `websocat`.\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  An attacker needs network access to the `goshs` server's websocket endpoint (port 8000 in the PoC). No authentication is required.\n*   **Mitigation or fix:** The commit `1602209` addresses the issue by adding a check for `cliEnabled` before executing commands and passing the CLI object to the `NewHub` function.  Updating to version 1.0.5 (patched version) resolves the vulnerability.\n*   **Affected versions:** v0.3.4 - 1.0.4\n*   **Patched versions:** 1.0.5\n*   **CVSS Score:** 9.4 (Critical)\n    *   Attack Vector: Network\n    *   Attack Complexity: Low\n    *   Privileges Required: None\n    *   User Interaction: None\n    *   Scope: Unchanged\n    *   Confidentiality: High\n    *   Integrity: High\n    *   Availability: Low\n\n**3. Additional Details:**\n\nThe provided content includes a detailed description of the vulnerability, a proof-of-concept (PoC) for exploitation, and information about the fix implemented in the patched version. The commit details show the specific code changes made to address the vulnerability. The CVSS vector is also provided.\n\nThis content provides more detail than the placeholder CVE description.",

The evidence clearly indicates that the `dispatchReadPump` function **does not check the option cli -c**, leading to the execution of arbitrary commands. This is a direct instance of CWE-78. The secondary CWE is CWE-284 because the vulnerability allows anyone to execute commands, which indicates an access control issue.\n\nThe selection of CWE-78 is based on the explicit description of OS command injection resulting from a lack of input validation. The vulnerability allows anyone to execute commands on the server, indicating an access control issue (CWE-284).\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-88: Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs a string for a command to be executed by a separate component\nin another control sphere, but it does not properly delimit the\nintended arguments, options, or switches within that command string.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1286: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input that is expected to be well-formed - i.e., to comply with a certain syntax - but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input complies with the syntax.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-346: Origin Validation Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly verify that the source of data or communication is valid.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web server receives a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
