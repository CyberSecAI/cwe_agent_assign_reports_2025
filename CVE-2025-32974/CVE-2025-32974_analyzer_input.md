# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-32974

## Vulnerability Description
XWiki is a generic wiki platform. In versions starting from 15.9-rc-1 to before 15.10.8 and from 16.0.0-rc-1 to before 16.2.0, the required **rights analysis doesnt consider TextAreas with default content type**. When editing a page, XWiki warns since version 15.9 when there is content on the page like a script macro that would gain more rights due to the editing. This analysis doesnt consider certain kinds of properties, allowing a user to put malicious scripts in there that will be executed after a user with script, admin, or programming rights edited the page. Such a malicious script could impact the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the whole XWiki installation. This issue has been patched in versions 15.10.8 and 16.2.0.

The commit `153dbfa` provides the fix.

**2. Information Extraction:**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The required rights analysis in XWiki did not properly consider `TextArea` properties with a default content type. This allowed malicious scripts to be inserted into pages.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A user could insert malicious scripts into `TextArea` properties with a default content type. When an administrator or a user with script rights edited the page, the malicious script would execute, potentially impacting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the XWiki installation.
*   **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   Confidentiality breach
    *   Integrity compromise
    *   Availability disruption
*   **Attack vectors:**
    1.  A user without script rights creates a class with a `TextArea` property.
    2.  The user creates a page with an object of that class and includes a Velocity macro within the `TextArea` property's content.
    3.  An administrator edits the page.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   A user account on XWiki with the ability to create classes and pages.
    *   Knowledge of Velocity macros or scripting to insert malicious code.
*   **Mitigation or fix:** The vulnerability was patched in XWiki versions 15.10.8 and 16.2.0.
*   **More detail than the official CVE description:** Yes. The content provides detailed steps to reproduce the vulnerability, the affected versions, the patched versions, and the severity of the issue. The CVSS score is provided.
