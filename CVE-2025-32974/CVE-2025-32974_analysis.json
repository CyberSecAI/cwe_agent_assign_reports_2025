  "description": "XWiki is a generic wiki platform. In versions starting from 15.9-rc-1 to before 15.10.8 and from 16.0.0-rc-1 to before 16.2.0, the required **rights analysis doesnt consider TextAreas with default content type**. When editing a page, XWiki warns since version 15.9 when there is content on the page like a script macro that would gain more rights due to the editing. This analysis doesnt consider certain kinds of properties, allowing a user to put malicious scripts in there that will be executed after a user with script, admin, or programming rights edited the page. Such a malicious script could impact the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the whole XWiki installation. This issue has been patched in versions 15.10.8 and 16.2.0.",

  "reference_content": "Here's an analysis of the provided content, focusing on the information relevant to CVE-2025-32974:\n\n**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**\n\n*   The content from `github.com_b920a264_20250624_131743.html`, `github.com_d61a2660_20250624_131743.html`, and `jira.xwiki.org_761638fa_20250624_131744.html` directly relates to the XWiki platform and a security vulnerability, GHSA-mvgm-3rw2-7j4r, which has been mapped to CVE-2025-32974. The commit `153dbfa` provides the fix.\n\n**2. Information Extraction:**\n\n*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The required rights analysis in XWiki did not properly consider `TextArea` properties with a default content type. This allowed malicious scripts to be inserted into pages.\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A user could insert malicious scripts into `TextArea` properties with a default content type. When an administrator or a user with script rights edited the page, the malicious script would execute, potentially impacting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the XWiki installation.\n*   **Impact of exploitation:**\n    *   Confidentiality breach\n    *   Integrity compromise\n    *   Availability disruption\n*   **Attack vectors:**\n    1.  A user without script rights creates a class with a `TextArea` property.\n    2.  The user creates a page with an object of that class and includes a Velocity macro within the `TextArea` property's content.\n    3.  An administrator edits the page.\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n    *   A user account on XWiki with the ability to create classes and pages.\n    *   Knowledge of Velocity macros or scripting to insert malicious code.\n*   **Mitigation or fix:** The vulnerability was patched in XWiki versions 15.10.8 and 16.2.0.\n*   **More detail than the official CVE description:** Yes. The content provides detailed steps to reproduce the vulnerability, the affected versions, the patched versions, and the severity of the issue. The CVSS score is provided.",

While a more specific child CWE might be ideal, the provided information doesn't pinpoint the precise authorization failure mechanism. CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')) represents the subsequent impact of the authorization bypass, as the **malicious script** is executed due to the **incorrect rights analysis**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    \n    cwe79 -- CANFOLLOW --> cwe863\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe79 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **incorrect authorization** (CWE-863), where the **rights analysis doesn't consider TextAreas with default content type**. This leads to the ability to inject **malicious scripts**. When a user with sufficient privileges edits the page, the injected script executes, resulting in a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79) and impacting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the XWiki installation.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the description highlights that the **rights analysis doesn't consider TextAreas with default content type**. This points towards an authorization issue. The Retriever Results also suggest CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) as a potential candidate. The vulnerability allows a user to put **malicious scripts** in a `TextArea`, which are executed when a user with higher privileges edits the page. This leads to an XSS vulnerability and the ability to impact the system's confidentiality, integrity, and availability.\n\nThe evidence supporting CWE-863 is that the **rights analysis doesn't consider TextAreas with default content type**. This indicates a flaw in the authorization mechanism, allowing unintended access or execution of code.\nThe evidence supporting CWE-79 is the ability to put **malicious scripts** in a `TextArea` that will be executed after a user with script, admin, or programming rights edited the page.\n\nCWE-863 is at the Class level, but the evidence doesn't allow for a more specific Base or Variant CWE to be selected. CWE-79 is at the Base level and is appropriate.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
