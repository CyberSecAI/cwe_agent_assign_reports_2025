# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-863 | Incorrect Authorization | 0.85 | Class | Primary | Allowed-with-Review |
| CWE-79 | Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') | 0.70 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.80
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship influencing the decision is the hierarchical nature between CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) and its potential children. While a more specific child CWE might be ideal, the provided information doesn't pinpoint the precise authorization failure mechanism. CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')) represents the subsequent impact of the authorization bypass, as the **malicious script** is executed due to the **incorrect rights analysis**.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **incorrect authorization** (CWE-863), where the **rights analysis doesn't consider TextAreas with default content type**. This leads to the ability to inject **malicious scripts**. When a user with sufficient privileges edits the page, the injected script executes, resulting in a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79) and impacting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the XWiki installation.

## Summary of Analysis
Initially, the description highlights that the **rights analysis doesn't consider TextAreas with default content type**. This points towards an authorization issue. The Retriever Results also suggest CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) as a potential candidate. The vulnerability allows a user to put **malicious scripts** in a `TextArea`, which are executed when a user with higher privileges edits the page. This leads to an XSS vulnerability and the ability to impact the system's confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

The evidence supporting CWE-863 is that the **rights analysis doesn't consider TextAreas with default content type**. This indicates a flaw in the authorization mechanism, allowing unintended access or execution of code.
The evidence supporting CWE-79 is the ability to put **malicious scripts** in a `TextArea` that will be executed after a user with script, admin, or programming rights edited the page.

CWE-863 is at the Class level, but the evidence doesn't allow for a more specific Base or Variant CWE to be selected. CWE-79 is at the Base level and is appropriate.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as "<", ">", and "&" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
