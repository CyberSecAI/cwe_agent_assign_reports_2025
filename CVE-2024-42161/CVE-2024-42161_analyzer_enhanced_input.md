## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved bpf Avoid **uninitialized value** in BPF_CORE_READ_BITFIELD [Changes from V1 - Use a default branch in the switch statement to initialize `val.] GCC warns that `val may be used uninitialized in the BPF_CRE_READ_BITFIELD macro, defined in bpf_core_read.h as [...] unsigned long long val \ [...] \ switch (__CORE_RELO(s, field, BYTE_SIZE)) { \ case 1 val = *(const unsigned char *)p break \ case 2 val = *(const unsigned short *)p break \ case 4 val = *(const unsigned int *)p break \ case 8 val = *(const unsigned long long *)p break \ } \ [...] val \ } \ This patch adds a default entry in the switch statement that sets `val to zero in order to avoid the warning, and random values to be used in case __builtin_preserve_field_info returns unexpected values for BPF_FIELD_BYTE_SIZE. Tested in bpf-next master. No regressions.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **uninitialized value**
- **vector:** BPF_CORE_READ_BITFIELD macro
- **product:** Linux kernel
- **component:** bpf

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability addressed by the commits:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability arises from the `BPF_CORE_READ_BITFIELD` macro within the Linux kernel's eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) subsystem. This macro is used to read bitfields from memory, and it contains a switch statement that handles different byte sizes. However, the switch statement lacked a default case, leading to the possibility of the `val` variable remaining uninitialized if the `__CORE_RELO(s, field, BYTE_SIZE)` macro returned a value not explicitly handled by the existing cases.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Uninitialized Variable:** The primary vulnerability is the potential use of an uninitialized `val` variable within the `BPF_CORE_READ_BITFIELD` macro. If the `switch` statement does not hit any of the cases (1, 2, 4, 8), `val` is not assigned a value and could contain arbitrary data.
- **Incorrect BPF_FIELD_BYTE_SIZE:** The vulnerability also includes the possibility of `__builtin_preserve_field_info` returning unexpected values for BPF_FIELD_BYTE_SIZE. This could lead to the switch statement not being able to assign a value to `val`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Undefined Behavior:** Using an uninitialized variable leads to undefined behavior, which can range from unpredictable results to program crashes.
- **Data Corruption:** In the context of eBPF, this could lead to incorrect data being read and used by the BPF program, potentially affecting network filtering, system monitoring, or other functionality reliant on eBPF.
- **Potential Security Issues:** While the primary issue is undefined behavior, this could potentially be exploited to introduce unexpected results that could have security consequences depending on the context of the program and the data being read.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malformed BPF programs:** An attacker could potentially craft a malicious BPF program that triggers the vulnerable code path.
- **Unexpected byte sizes:** An attacker may attempt to manipulate the input to `__builtin_preserve_field_info` to generate an unexpected byte size, causing the uninitialized value to be used.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to load eBPF programs:** The attacker needs to be able to load and execute eBPF programs on the target system. This typically requires root privileges or specific capabilities.
- **Knowledge of target structure:** The attacker likely needs some knowledge of the data structures and bitfields the BPF program is attempting to read to trigger the vulnerability.

**Mitigation:**

The fix introduces a default case in the `switch` statement, initializing `val` to 0. This ensures that `val` is always initialized regardless of the value of `__CORE_RELO(s, field, BYTE_SIZE)`.

**Additional Notes:**

- The commits mention that GCC warned about the uninitialized variable, indicating the use of static analysis tools to find this type of problem.
- The fix is a simple one line change, which highlights the importance of having a comprehensive approach to catch such subtle issues.
- This issue is related to the BPF Core feature which allows BPF programs to access data structures from the kernel or other processes.

## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.

### Extended Description
This can happen in signed and unsigned cases.

### Alternative Terms
Integer underflow: 

"Integer underflow" is sometimes used to identify signedness errors in which an originally positive number becomes negative as a result of subtraction. However, there are cases of bad subtraction in which unsigned integers are involved, so it's not always a signedness issue.


"Integer underflow" is occasionally used to describe array index errors in which the index is negative.

### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This weakness is a major factor in a number of resultant weaknesses, especially in web applications that allow global variable initialization (such as PHP) with libraries that can be directly requested.

**[Research Gap]** It is highly likely that a large number of resultant weaknesses have missing initialization as a primary factor, but researcher reports generally do not provide this level of detail.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2020-6078:** Chain: The return value of a function returning a pointer is not checked for success (CWE-252) resulting in the later use of an uninitialized variable (CWE-456) and a null pointer dereference (CWE-476)
- **CVE-2009-2692:** Chain: Use of an unimplemented network socket operation pointing to an uninitialized handler function (CWE-456) causes a crash because of a null pointer dereference (CWE-476).
- **CVE-2020-20739:** A variable that has its value set in a conditional statement is sometimes used when the conditional fails, sometimes causing data leakage




## CWE-197: Numeric Truncation Error
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
Truncation errors occur when a primitive is cast to a primitive of a smaller size and data is lost in the conversion.

### Extended Description
When a primitive is cast to a smaller primitive, the high order bits of the large value are lost in the conversion, potentially resulting in an unexpected value that is not equal to the original value. This value may be required as an index into a buffer, a loop iterator, or simply necessary state data. In any case, the value cannot be trusted and the system will be in an undefined state. While this method may be employed viably to isolate the low bits of a value, this usage is rare, and truncation usually implies that an implementation error has occurred.

### Additional Notes
**[Research Gap]** This weakness has traditionally been under-studied and under-reported, although vulnerabilities in popular software have been published in 2008 and 2009.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2020-17087:** Chain: integer truncation (CWE-197) causes small buffer allocation (CWE-131) leading to out-of-bounds write (CWE-787) in kernel pool, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2009-0231:** Integer truncation of length value leads to heap-based buffer overflow.
- **CVE-2008-3282:** Size of a particular type changes for 64-bit platforms, leading to an integer truncation in document processor causes incorrect index to be generated.




## CWE-194: Unexpected Sign Extension
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product performs an operation on a number that causes it to be sign extended when it is transformed into a larger data type. When the original number is negative, this can produce unexpected values that lead to resultant weaknesses.

### Extended Description

### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Sign extension errors can lead to buffer overflows and other memory-based problems. They are also likely to be factors in other weaknesses that are not based on memory operations, but rely on numeric calculation.

**[Maintenance]** This entry is closely associated with signed-to-unsigned conversion errors (CWE-195) and other numeric errors. These relationships need to be more closely examined within CWE.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2018-10887:** Chain: unexpected sign extension (CWE-194) leads to integer overflow (CWE-190), causing an out-of-bounds read (CWE-125)
- **CVE-1999-0234:** Sign extension error produces -1 value that is treated as a command separator, enabling OS command injection.
- **CVE-2003-0161:** Product uses "char" type for input character. When char is implemented as a signed type, ASCII value 0xFF (255), a sign extension produces a -1 value that is treated as a program-specific separator value, effectively disabling a length check and leading to a buffer overflow. This is also a multiple interpretation error.




## CWE-457: Use of Uninitialized Variable
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The code uses a variable that has not been initialized, leading to unpredictable or unintended results.

### Extended Description
In some languages such as C and C++, stack variables are not initialized by default. They generally contain junk data with the contents of stack memory before the function was invoked. An attacker can sometimes control or read these contents. In other languages or conditions, a variable that is not explicitly initialized can be given a default value that has security implications, depending on the logic of the program. The presence of an uninitialized variable can sometimes indicate a typographic error in the code.

### Alternative Terms

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2019-15900:** Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).
- **CVE-2008-3688:** Chain: A denial of service may be caused by an uninitialized variable (CWE-457) allowing an infinite loop (CWE-835) resulting from a connection to an unresponsive server.
- **CVE-2008-0081:** Uninitialized variable leads to code execution in popular desktop application.
