# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-7440

## Vulnerability Description
** UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED ** A vulnerability was found in Vivotek CC8160 VVTK-0100d. It has been classified as critical. This affects the function getenv of the file upload_file.cgi. The manipulation of the argument QUERY_STRING leads to **command injection**. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. The identifier VDB-273525 was assigned to this vulnerability. NOTE This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer. NOTE Vendor was contacted early and confirmed that the affected release tree is end-of-life.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **command injection**
- **impact:** arbitrary command execution
- **vector:** manipulation of QUERY_STRING argument
- **product:** Vivotek CC8160
- **version:** VVTK-0100d
- **component:** upload_file.cgi

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability lies in the `upload_file.cgi` script of the Vivotek CC8160 camera.
- The script uses the `getenv` function to retrieve the GET request parameters.
- It then extracts the first field of this data without proper sanitization and concatenates it into a command using `snprintf`.
- Finally, the `system` function executes this constructed command.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Command Injection:** The core issue is that user-controlled input (the GET request parameters) is directly incorporated into a system command without any filtering or sanitization.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The program fails to validate or sanitize the user-provided input before using it in a `system` call.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious commands into the GET request, which the device will then execute with the privileges of the web server process. This allows them to perform a wide range of malicious actions on the system, including data exfiltration, denial of service, and taking complete control of the camera.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **GET Request Manipulation:** The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the parameters sent via a GET request to `upload_file.cgi`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** An attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable device to send the malicious GET request. This could be within the same local network or, depending on the device's configuration, potentially from the internet.
- **Basic Knowledge of HTTP:** The attacker should understand how to construct HTTP GET requests and append parameters.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerable code is located at line 61 (using `getenv`), 69 (extracting the first field), and the `system` function.
- This vulnerability is present in the Vivotek CC8160 camera.
- The provided source link points to a Notion page with more details on the vulnerability, however, that link is not included in the official CVE description.
