# Analysis Report for CVE-2024-6552

# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-6552

## Description

The Booking for Appointments and Events Calendar - Amelia plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Full Path Disclosure in all versions up to, and including, 1.2. This is due to the plugin **utilizing Symfony and leaving display_errors on within test files**. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve the full path of the web application, which can be used to aid other attacks. The information displayed is not useful on its own, and requires another vulnerability to be present for damage to an affected website.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Rootcause:** utilizing Symfony and leaving display_errors on within test files
- **Weakness:** full path disclosure
- **Impact:** Full Path Disclosure
- **Attacker:** unauthenticated attackers
- **Product:** Booking for Appointments and Events Calendar - Amelia plugin for WordPress
- **Version:** up to and including 1.2

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-200 | Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor | 0.9 | Class | Primary | Allowed-with-Review |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-200 which is a Class level CWE. The retriever results also included several Base level CWEs related to Authorization and Authentication, but those do not apply as the vulnerability is about exposure of information and not related to authorization or authentication.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **rootcause** of Symfony's `display_errors` being enabled in test files. This leads to the **weakness** of Full Path Disclosure, which is a form of sensitive information exposure. The final impact is that unauthenticated attackers can retrieve the full path of the web application, potentially aiding other attacks.

## Summary of Analysis
The vulnerability is a Full Path Disclosure due to having `display_errors` enabled. The vulnerability is about exposing sensitive information. The closest CWE is CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor. This is further supported by the "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" which lists the weaknesses as "Full Path Disclosure".
The evidence clearly indicates that the plugin exposes sensitive information (full path) to unauthorized actors (unauthenticated attackers) due to improper configuration (`display_errors` enabled). This aligns directly with the description of CWE-200.

The other CWEs such as authorization and authentication related CWEs are not applicable in this case as the vulnerability is not about authentication or authorization.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
**Abstraction Level**: Compound
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.

## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-862: Missing Authorization
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
