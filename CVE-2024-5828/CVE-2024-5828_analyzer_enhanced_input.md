## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-5828

**Vulnerability:** EL Injection Vulnerability

**Affected Product:** Hitachi Tuning Manager

**Affected Versions:** Versions less than 8.8.7-00 on Windows, Linux, and Solaris. Note that the fix is only for Windows as Solaris and Linux are no longer supported.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to an EL injection flaw in Hitachi Tuning Manager. EL (Expression Language) injection occurs when user-supplied data is incorporated into an EL expression without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code.

**Weaknesses:**
*   Lack of proper sanitization of user-provided input before using it in EL expressions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   According to the CVSS score, the impact is rated as:
    *   **Confidentiality: Low** (C:L) - Some sensitive information can be accessed.
    *   **Integrity: Low** (I:L) - Some modification of data is possible.
    *   **Availability: High** (A:H) - Can lead to a significant loss of availability.
*   Overall, this could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to data, modify data, and/or disrupt the system's normal operation

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network (AV:N):** The vulnerability can be exploited over a network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Low Attack Complexity (AC:L):** The attack is relatively easy to execute.
*   **No Privileges Required (PR:N):** No specific user privileges are needed to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **No User Interaction Required (UI:N):** User interaction is not necessary to trigger the vulnerability.

**Fix:**
*   Upgrade to version 8.8.7-00 for Windows. There is no fix for Linux or Solaris as they are no longer supported.

**Workarounds:**
*   None specified.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The CVSS v3.1 score for this vulnerability is 8.6 (High).
*   Hitachi recommends removing storage devices that are no longer supported from management and monitoring to prevent exploitation of latent vulnerabilities.
