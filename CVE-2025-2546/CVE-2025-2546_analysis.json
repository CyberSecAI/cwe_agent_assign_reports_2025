  "description": "A vulnerability classified as problematic was found in D-Link DIR-618 and DIR-605L 2.02/3.02. This vulnerability affects unknown code of the file /goform/formAdvFirewall of the component Firewall Service. The manipulation leads to **improper access controls**. The attack needs to be approached within the local network. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer.",

Therefore, CWE-284 is the most appropriate choice given the available evidence.\n\nOther CWEs were considered but not selected due to lack of specific evidence:\n\n*   CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function): This is a possible cause of the **improper access control**, but the description doesn't explicitly state that authentication is missing.\n*   CWE-425 (Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')): Similar to CWE-306, this is a potential type of access control issue, but there's no direct evidence to support it.\n*   CWE-288 (Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel): Again, a possible access control issue, but not directly stated.\n*   CWE-79, CWE-89, CWE-78, CWE-184, CWE-113: These are all related to injection or input validation, but the vulnerability is explicitly about access control.\nRelevant CWE Information:",
