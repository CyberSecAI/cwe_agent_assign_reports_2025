A more specific Base-level CWE related to authorization would be ideal, but in this case, the description focuses on the absence of any authorization check rather than an incorrect one. CWE-89 [Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')] is a consequence of the missing authorization, as the lack of access control allows attackers to inject SQL commands. CWE-862 is a parent of CWE-425 [Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')], which could be considered if the vulnerability involved direct access to restricted resources, but the SQL injection aspect makes CWE-89 a more relevant secondary CWE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    cwe425[\"CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\"]\n    \n    cwe425 -->|CHILDOF| cwe862\n    cwe89 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe862\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe89 secondary\n    class cwe425 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing capability check** (CWE-862 [Missing Authorization]). Because there is no check, authenticated users with low privileges can then inject SQL (CWE-89 [Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')]), leading to unauthorized data loss.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary root cause is the **missing capability check**, which directly translates to CWE-862 [Missing Authorization]. The vulnerability description clearly states this **missing capability check** on the `template_delete_saved` function.
