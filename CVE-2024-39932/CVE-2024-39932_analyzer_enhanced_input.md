## Vulnerability Description
Gogs through 0.13.0 allows **argument injection** during the previewing of changes.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **argument injection**
- **vector:** argument injection
- **product:** Gogs
- **version:** through 0.13.0

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2024-39932:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by an **argument injection** flaw in the changes preview functionality of Gogs. Specifically, when generating a preview of changes, user-controlled input is incorporated into a command executed by the server without proper sanitization or escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Argument Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-provided input when constructing the command for previewing changes. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary arguments into the command, potentially leading to malicious actions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the Gogs server by injecting malicious arguments. These commands would run with the same privileges as the Gogs application (`RUN_USER`).
- **Source Code Compromise:** Attackers can read all source code on the Gogs instance, modify it, or delete it entirely.
- **Internal Network Attack:** Attackers can pivot to attack internal hosts that are reachable from the Gogs server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** The attacker sends a specially crafted HTTP request to the Gogs server, specifically targeting the changes preview functionality. The request path would look like `/<user>/<repo>/_preview/<branch>/--`. The `--` at the end of the path signifies the beginning of the injected arguments.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the Gogs instance.
- **Knowledge of a Repository:** The attacker needs to know the username, repository name, and branch of a repository in the Gogs instance to craft the attack request.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is present in the latest Gogs version (0.13.0) at the time of the report and is still unpatched.
- The `env` command's `--split-string` option was used as an example in the blog post to explain how arbitrary commands can be injected, but this specific option is not related to CVE-2024-39932. It was related to CVE-2024-39930.
- The blog post provides a patch that adds an end-of-options argument (`--`) to separate user-controlled arguments from the options, thus preventing the argument injection.
- It also provides recommendations like disabling the built-in SSH server to mitigate CVE-2024-39930 and disabling user registration, or to switch to Gitea.
- The blog suggests that network level detection for this vulnerability will involve HTTP requests with the specific path structure mentioned above.
- The CVE entry was published on 2024-07-04.
- Gogs version 0.13.2 fixes this vulnerability.
