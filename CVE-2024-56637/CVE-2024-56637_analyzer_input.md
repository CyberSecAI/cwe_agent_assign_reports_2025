# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-56637

## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved netfilter ipset **Hold module reference while requesting a module** User space may unload ip_set.ko while it is itself requesting a set type backend module, leading to a kernel crash. The **race condition** may be provoked by inserting an mdelay() right after the nfnl_unlock() call.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **component:** netfilter ipset Hold module
- **rootcause:** **race condition**
- **vector:** mdelay() right after the nfnl_unlock() call
- **weakness:** **Hold module reference while requesting a module**
- **product:** Linux kernel
- **impact:** kernel crash, unload ip_set.ko

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is a race condition in the Linux kernel's IP set module (ipset). Specifically, the `ip_set.ko` module can be unloaded by user space while the module itself is in the process of requesting a set type backend module. This leads to a use-after-free scenario and a kernel crash. The race condition can be triggered by inserting a delay (`mdelay()`) immediately after calling `nfnl_unlock()`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Race Condition:**  The vulnerability stems from a race between the unloading of the `ip_set.ko` module and the module's request for a backend module, specifically when `nfnl_unlock()` is called before the backend module is fully loaded and a reference held.
*   **Use-After-Free:** If the `ip_set.ko` module is unloaded while still trying to load a set type module, the kernel will likely attempt to access freed memory, leading to a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Kernel Crash:** The primary impact of successfully exploiting this vulnerability is a kernel crash, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **User Space Interaction:** The vulnerability is triggered by interactions from user space. Specifically, a user-space process can initiate the unloading of the `ip_set.ko` module while it is in the process of loading a backend module.
*   **Timing:** Exploitation depends on timing. The user space needs to unload the `ip_set.ko` module in a precise window after it has requested another module using `request_module("ip_set_%s", name)` after releasing the Netfilter lock.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Ability to unload kernel modules:** The attacker must have the privilege to unload kernel modules, which generally requires root or similar capabilities, or through an unprivileged process capable of causing the race through the Netfilter subsystem.

**Patch Details:**
The fix involves holding a reference to the `ip_set` module (using `try_module_get(THIS_MODULE)`) before releasing the Netfilter lock and requesting the backend module to prevent premature unloading, and releasing this reference with `module_put(THIS_MODULE)` after the request is completed successfully or has failed. This ensures the module remains loaded until the backend module loading process is complete.

**More detail than CVE:**
The provided content offers greater details than a typical CVE description. Specifically:
*   The exact vulnerable code path and race condition scenario with timing requirements are outlined
*   The specific `nfnl_unlock()` call and use of `request_module()` are highlighted
*   The method to trigger the race using `mdelay()` is included.
*   The fix is described in detail, which is to hold a module reference when requesting another module.
