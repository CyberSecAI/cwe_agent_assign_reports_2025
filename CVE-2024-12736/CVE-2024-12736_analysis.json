Example: `https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=buse_new_group&perm_panel=testxss\"><script>alert(1)</script>`\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\nThe attacker needs to be able to create a malicious URL and trick a user with sufficient privileges (e.g., administrator) into clicking it.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\nAs of the provided information, there is no known fix available.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n*   **Affected Plugin:** BU Section Editing <= 0.9.9\n*   **CVSS Score:** 7.1 (High)\n*   **Researcher:** Hassan Khan Yusufzai - Splint3r7\n*   **WPVDB ID:** d3c6a4c1-8358-4f8b-b58d-3f712052668f\n*   **CWE:** CWE-79\n*   **OWASP Top 10:** A7: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",

The impact is the execution of arbitrary scripts in the context of a high-privilege user, such as an administrator.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, specifically the vulnerability description and the CVE reference summary, both of which explicitly state the presence of a **cross-site scripting** vulnerability due to **improper neutralization**.\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"The BU Section Editing WordPress plugin through 0.9.9 does not sanitise and escape a parameter before outputting it back in the page, leading to a Reflected **Cross-Site Scripting** which could be used against high privilege users such as admin.\"\n\nThe CVE reference summary highlights the root cause: \"The plugin does not sanitize and escape a parameter before outputting it back in the page.\" and \"Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: \\* Reflected **Cross-Site Scripting** (XSS)\".\n\nCWE-79 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the core issue of **improper neutralization** of input leading to XSS.

Thus, CWE-79 is a more precise representation of the vulnerability.\n\n**CWE-862: Missing Authorization** was considered and rejected. The vulnerability is not related to missing authorization checks.\n\n**CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter** was considered and rejected. The vulnerability is not related to the external control of assumed immutable web parameters.\n\n**CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')** was considered and rejected.
