    "enhanced_query": "# Vulnerability Description\n\n    The ScrollTo Bottom plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to **Cross-Site Request Forgery** to **Arbitrary File Upload** in versions up to, and including, 1.1.1. This is due to **missing nonce validation and missing file type validation** in the options_page function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected sites server which may make remote code execution possible via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'missing nonce validation and missing file type validation'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1.
