  "query": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drm/i915/gt Use spin_lock_irqsave() in interruptible context spin_lock/unlock() functions used in interrupt contexts could result in a deadlock, as seen in GitLab issue #13399, which occurs when interrupt comes in while holding a lock. Try to remedy the problem by saving irq state before spin lock acquisition. v2 add irqs state save/restore calls to all locks/unlocks in signal_irq_work() execution (Maciej) v3 use with spin_lock_irqsave() in guc_lrc_desc_unpin() instead of other lock/unlock calls and add Fixes and Cc tags (Tvrtko) change title and commit message (cherry picked from commit c088387ddd6482b40f21ccf23db1125e8fa4af7e)",
