  "description": "A vulnerability has been found in ThingsBoard up to 3.7.0 and classified as problematic. Affected by this vulnerability is an unknown functionality of the component HTTP RPC API. The manipulation leads to resource consumption. The attack can be launched remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation appears to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. Upgrading to version 3.7.1 is able to address this issue. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component. The vendor was informed on 2024-07-24 about this vulnerability and announced the release of 3.7.1 for the second half of September 2024.",

CWE-770 is a specific type of resource consumption. There is also a CANFOLLOW relationship between CWE-20 Improper Input Validation and CWE-770, though not relevant here. The abstraction levels were considered, and CWE-770 at the Base level was deemed most appropriate.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe770 primary\n    class cwe400 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of limits or throttling** on resource allocation by the ThingsBoard platform when handling responses from a device's RPC server (CWE-770). This leads directly to **resource exhaustion**, specifically Out-of-Memory errors, and ultimately a denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified several potential CWEs, but after reviewing the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling was selected as the most appropriate.\n\nThe key evidence supporting this decision is:\n*   \"The Thingsboard platform attempts to handle a large response from a device's RPC server, leading to **resource exhaustion**.\"\n*   \"The vulnerability lies in the **lack of proper handling of excessively large responses** from an RPC server, leading to resource exhaustion.\"\n*   \"The Thingsboard platform experiences Out-of-Memory (OOM) errors and eventually crashes, resulting in a denial of service.\"\n\nThe vulnerability involves the ThingsBoard platform's **failure to limit or throttle** the amount of resources allocated to handle responses from device RPC servers. The lack of these limits means that an attacker can cause **resource exhaustion** by configuring a device to return a large amount of data. This directly aligns with the definition of CWE-770, \"The product allocates a reusable resource or group of resources on behalf of an actor without imposing any restrictions on the size or number of resources that can be allocated.\"\n\nThe retriever results listed other CWEs such as CWE-79, CWE-89, CWE-22, CWE-306. These are not appropriate because the root cause is not related to input validation, SQL injection, path traversal, or missing authentication. While CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption is also relevant, CWE-770 is more specific.\n\nThe final selection of CWE-770 is based on the clear evidence of **missing limits/throttling** leading directly to **resource exhaustion**. The CWE is at the optimal level of specificity, and the mapping guidance allows its use.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
