  "description": "Discourse is an open source platform for community discussion. In affected versions the endpoint for generating inline oneboxes for URLs wasnt enforcing limits on the number of URLs that it accepted, allowing a malicious user to inflict denial of service on some parts of the app. This vulnerability is only exploitable by authenticated users. This issue has been patched in the latest stable, beta and tests-passed versions of Discourse. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should turn off the `enable inline onebox on all domains` site setting and remove all entries from the `allowed inline onebox domains` site setting.",

It details a partial denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability in Discourse. Here's a breakdown of the information extracted:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe endpoint for generating inline oneboxes for URLs did not enforce limits on the number of URLs accepted, allowing a malicious user to inflict a denial of service.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Uncontrolled resource consumption (specifically, the number of URLs processed for inline oneboxes).\n*   Lack of input validation/limiting on the `/inline-onebox` endpoint.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   Denial of service on parts of the application.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   An authenticated user can send a request to the `/inline-onebox` endpoint with a large number of URLs (more than 10).\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   The attacker must be an authenticated user of the Discourse application.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   **Patches:** The issue is patched in Discourse versions stable >= 3.3.3, beta >= 3.4.0.beta4, and tests-passed >= 3.4.0.beta4.\n*   **Workarounds:**\n    *   Disable the `enable inline onebox on all domains` site setting.\n    *   Remove all entries from the `allowed inline onebox domains` site setting.\n*   The commit `416ec83` limits the `/inline-onebox` endpoint to 10 URLs at a time.\n\n**CVSS Score:**\n\n*   CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L (Overall score: 4.3/10 - Moderate)\n\n**Additional Details (compared to a hypothetical CVE description):**\n\n*   The content provides specific details about the fix implemented in the commit `416ec83`.\n*   It details the workaround options available to mitigate the vulnerability before patching.\n*   It includes the CVSS vector string and overall score.\n*   The content provides details on how to reproduce the vulnerability in a testing environment.\n*   The content details how concurrent requests are handled and blocked.",

No other CWEs from the retriever results or graph analysis showed a stronger or more direct fit. There were no parent/child or chain relationships that significantly altered the assessment, as CWE-400 directly reflects the identified **weakness**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe400 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain consists of the following:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Lack of rate limiting** on the number of URLs accepted by the inline onebox generation endpoint (CWE-400).\n2.  **Impact:** Denial of service, making parts of the application unavailable.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis and the final conclusion both strongly point to CWE-400 as the most accurate classification. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions that the endpoint for generating inline oneboxes **wasn't enforcing limits** on the number of URLs, which is the core characteristic of CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption).
