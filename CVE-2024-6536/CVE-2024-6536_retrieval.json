Specifically, the plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied data when creating or editing project names and descriptions.\\n- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows high-privilege users such as editors and admins to inject malicious JavaScript code into the plugin's settings. This code is then executed in the browsers of other users who access the affected pages. This can lead to a variety of attacks, including session hijacking, defacement, and redirection to malicious sites. The stored XSS can be triggered even when the `unfiltered_html` capability is disallowed.\\n- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited via the plugin's project creation functionality. An attacker, with editor or admin privileges, crafts a malicious project name containing JavaScript and submits it through the plugin's interface.\\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have high privileges, such as editor or administrator role, in the WordPress instance. They also need to be able to log into the admin panel.\\n\\nThe provided content gives more detail than the basic CVE description by detailing the specific attack vector, the required user privileges, and a proof of concept script.\", similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {}, 'top_cwes_by_threshold': {}}}, similarity_summary=SimilarityInsight(consensus_cwe='', top_cwes=[], confidence_levels={}, total_samples=0), analysis='', analysis_with_relationships='', criticism='', resolution='', relevant_cwes=[{'metadata': {'doc_id': '352', 'name': 'Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'rootcause:does not sanitise and escape some of its settings', 'keyphrase': 'does not sanitise and escape some of its settings', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'rootcause:lack of input sanitization', 'keyphrase': 'lack of input sanitization', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'weakness:cross-site scripting', 'keyphrase': 'cross-site scripting', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'impact:Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks', 'keyphrase': 'Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks', 'type': 'impact'}, {'id': 'attacker:high privilege users', 'keyphrase': 'high privilege users', 'type': 'attacker'}, {'id': 'product:Zephyr Project Manager WordPress plugin', 'keyphrase': 'Zephyr Project Manager WordPress plugin', 'type': 'product'}, {'id': 'version:before 3.3.99', 'keyphrase': 'before 3.3.99', 'type': 'version'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(570.9251758859216)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '116', 'name': 'Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
