  "reference_content": "- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Zephyr Project Manager plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape some of its settings.\n- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Specifically, the plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied data when creating or editing project names and descriptions.\n- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows high-privilege users such as editors and admins to inject malicious JavaScript code into the plugin's settings. This code is then executed in the browsers of other users who access the affected pages. This can lead to a variety of attacks, including session hijacking, defacement, and redirection to malicious sites. The stored XSS can be triggered even when the `unfiltered_html` capability is disallowed.\n- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited via the plugin's project creation functionality. An attacker, with editor or admin privileges, crafts a malicious project name containing JavaScript and submits it through the plugin's interface.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have high privileges, such as editor or administrator role, in the WordPress instance. They also need to be able to log into the admin panel.\n\nThe provided content gives more detail than the basic CVE description by detailing the specific attack vector, the required user privileges, and a proof of concept script.",

The vulnerability description states the plugin **\"does not sanitise and escape some of its settings\"**.

However, **CWE-79** directly addresses the XSS issue, making it the primary concern.\n\nThe evidence clearly supports the selection of **CWE-79** as the primary CWE, with **CWE-116** as a secondary contributing factor.
