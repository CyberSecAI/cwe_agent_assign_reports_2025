# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-53858

## Vulnerability Description
The gh cli is GitHubs official command line tool. A security vulnerability has been identified in the GitHub CLI that could leak authentication tokens when cloning repositories containing `git` submodules hosted outside of GitHub.com and ghe.com. This vulnerability stems from several `gh` commands used to clone a repository with submodules from a non-GitHub host including `gh repo clone`, `gh repo fork`, and `gh pr checkout`. These GitHub CLI commands invoke git with instructions to retrieve authentication tokens using the `credential.helper` configuration variable for any host encountered. Prior to version `2.63.0`, hosts other than GitHub.com and ghe.com are treated as GitHub Enterprise Server hosts and have tokens sourced from the following environment variables before falling back to host-specific tokens stored within system-specific secured storage 1. `GITHUB_ENTERPRISE_TOKEN`, 2. `GH_ENTERPRISE_TOKEN` and 3. `GITHUB_TOKEN` when the `CODESPACES` environment variable is set. The result being `git` sending authentication tokens when cloning submodules. In version `2.63.0`, these GitHub CLI commands will limit the hosts for which `gh` acts as a credential helper to source authentication tokens. Additionally, `GITHUB_TOKEN` will only be used for GitHub.com and ghe.com. Users are advised to upgrade. Additionally users are advised to revoke authentication tokens used with the GitHub CLI and to review their personal security log and any relevant audit logs for actions associated with their account or enterprise

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **improper access control**
- **impact:** leak authentication tokens
- **product:** GitHub CLI
- **version:** prior to 2.63.0

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The GitHub CLI (`gh`) incorrectly treats non-GitHub.com and non-ghe.com hosts as GitHub Enterprise Server hosts when cloning repositories with submodules, leading to the exposure of authentication tokens.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The `gh` CLI commands `gh repo clone`, `gh repo fork`, and `gh pr checkout` invoke `git` with instructions to retrieve authentication tokens using the `credential.helper` configuration for any encountered host, including non-GitHub hosts.
- Prior to version `2.63.0`, `gh` incorrectly sourced tokens from environment variables (`GITHUB_ENTERPRISE_TOKEN`, `GH_ENTERPRISE_TOKEN`, and `GITHUB_TOKEN` when `CODESPACES` is set) for non-GitHub hosts, treating them as GitHub Enterprise Server instances.
- Git may then send these tokens to the submodule host during cloning.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Leaked authentication tokens could be used by a third party to access privileged resources on the non-GitHub submodule host.

**Attack vectors:**
- Cloning a repository with a submodule hosted on a non-GitHub domain using the vulnerable `gh` commands.
- The attacker would need to control or compromise a git repository, with a submodule pointing to a server under their control.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to create or control a git repository with submodules hosted on a non-GitHub server.
- The attacker needs a victim to clone the repository using vulnerable versions of the `gh` tool.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is fixed in `gh` version `2.63.0` by limiting the hosts for which `gh` acts as a credential helper and by restricting the usage of `GITHUB_TOKEN` to GitHub.com and ghe.com.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 6.5 (Moderate severity).
- The attack vector is local, but the impact involves high confidentiality and integrity issues.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control

**Authentication**:
Determines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.

* Example phrases: "user must log in", "lack of login check", "bypasses login"
* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.

  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* – used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).

**Authorization**:
Determines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do. It decides access *after* identity is verified.

* Example phrases: "unauthorized access", "regular user can access admin panel", "role checks are missing"
* CWE relevance: use CWEs like 862, 863, 285 for authorization errors:

  * **CWE-862**: *Missing Authorization* – the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all.
  * **CWE-863**: *Incorrect Authorization* – the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).
  * **CWE-285**: *Improper Authorization* – general category for any flawed authorization logic or design.

**Access Control**:
A broader term that includes both authentication and authorization. Governs how resources are protected and who can access them under what conditions.

* CWE relevance:

  * **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* – top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear.
  * This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.

## Mapping Discussion – Common Misclassification Patterns

### 1. **CWE-306 vs CWE-862**:

* **306** is about lack of **authentication** (e.g., *no login required at all*).
* **862** is about lack of **authorization** *after* authentication (e.g., *admin check missing*).
* ✅ Example CWE-306: *“An unauthenticated attacker can invoke the password reset API.”*
* ✅ Example CWE-862: *“An authenticated user without admin privileges can delete any user account.”*

### 2. **CWE-285 vs CWE-284**:

* **285** is specific to authorization flaws – it's a better choice than 284 **if** the issue involves *improper or missing role checks*.
* **284** should be reserved for general access control issues when it’s unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.

---

## Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification

**Phrase like "unauthorized access" is not enough.**

* If you **cannot determine whether identity was checked**, assume it’s **authorization** and consider 862 or 863.
* If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** → CWE-306.
* If the **access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced**, but it's not due to missing checks, consider **CWE-284**.

---

## Good Mapping Examples

* ✅ **CWE-306**: “The endpoint `/admin/deleteUser` does not require any authentication.”
* ✅ **CWE-862**: “Any logged-in user can change any other user's email without being an admin.”
* ✅ **CWE-863**: “An admin check exists but incorrectly grants access to non-admin users.”
* ✅ **CWE-285**: “Application uses a static role check that fails when roles change dynamically.”
* ✅ **CWE-284**: “Inconsistent enforcement of access rules across services with unclear policy source.”
