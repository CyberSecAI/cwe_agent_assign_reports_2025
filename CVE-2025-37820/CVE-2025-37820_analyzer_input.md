# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-37820

## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved xen-netfront handle NULL returned by xdp_convert_buff_to_frame() The function xdp_convert_buff_to_frame() may return NULL if it fails to correctly convert the XDP buffer into an XDP frame due to memory constraints, internal errors, or invalid data. Failing to check for NULL may lead to a **NULL pointer dereference** if the result is used later in processing, potentially causing crashes, data corruption, or undefined behavior. On XDP redirect failure, the associated page must be released explicitly if it was previously retained via get_page(). Failing to do so may result in a memory leak, as the pages reference count is not decremented.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **component:** xen-netfront
- **rootcause:** **NULL pointer dereference, memory leak**
- **weakness:** **NULL pointer dereference**
- **product:** Linux kernel
