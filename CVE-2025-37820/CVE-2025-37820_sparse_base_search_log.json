Failing to check for NULL may lead to a NULL pointer dereference if the result is used later in processing, potentially causing crashes, data corruption, or undefined behavior. On XDP redirect failure, the associated page must be released explicitly if it was previously retained via get_page(). Failing to do so may result in a memory leak, as the pages reference count is not decremented.",
