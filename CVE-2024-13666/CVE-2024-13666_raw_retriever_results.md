# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-13666
## Query
The Fluent Forms Customizable Contact Forms, Survey, Quiz, & Conversational Form Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to IP Address Spoofing in all versions up to, and including, 5.2.12 due to insufficient IP address validation and use of user-supplied HTTP headers as a primary method for IP retrieval. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers spoof their IP address and submit forms that may have IP-based restrictions.

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: 'insufficient IP address validation'
