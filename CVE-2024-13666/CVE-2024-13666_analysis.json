CWE-1286 [Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input] is a contributing factor, as the input (IP address) isn't validated correctly.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe290[\"CWE-290: Authentication Bypass by Spoofing\"]\n    cwe1286[\"CWE-1286: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    \n    cwe290 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    cwe1286 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe290 primary\n    class cwe1286 secondary\n    class cwe20 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the **insufficient IP address validation** (CWE-1286 [Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input]), which enables attackers to spoof their IP address (CWE-290 [Authentication Bypass by Spoofing]). This allows unauthenticated attackers to bypass IP-based restrictions and submit forms.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and the retriever results. The primary CWE, CWE-290 [Authentication Bypass by Spoofing], is selected because the vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers to spoof their IP address, effectively bypassing any IP-based restrictions. This aligns with the description of CWE-290, which is an attack-focused weakness caused by incorrectly implemented authentication schemes that are subject to spoofing attacks. The secondary CWE, CWE-1286 [Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input], is selected because the **insufficient IP address validation** is the root cause that enables the spoofing. This is supported by the vulnerability description key phrases which call out **insufficient IP address validation** as the rootcause. The retriever results also support these findings, with CWE-290 [Authentication Bypass by Spoofing] and CWE-1286 [Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input] being among the top candidates.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-290 [Authentication Bypass by Spoofing] is a Base level CWE, which is preferred for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities. CWE-1286 [Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input] is also a Base level CWE, which accurately represents the **insufficient IP address validation** that is the root cause of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of
