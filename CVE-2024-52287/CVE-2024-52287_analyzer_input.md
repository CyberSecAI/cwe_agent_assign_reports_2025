## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-52287:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Insufficient validation of OAuth scopes when using `client_credentials` or `device_code` grants.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- When using `device_code` grant, a user could authorize a set of scopes, and an attacker could then acquire a token with a different set of scopes (including those not configured).
- When using the `client_credentials` grant, no scope validation was performed, allowing tokens to be issued with unconfigured scopes.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers could obtain tokens with broader permissions than intended.
- These tokens could be used to send requests to other systems which trust tokens signed by authentik and execute malicious actions on behalf of the user or application.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attacks.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- A valid set of OAuth2 `client_id` and `client_secret` credentials.
- Knowledge of another system that trusts tokens issued by authentik and the scopes it checks for.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability exists in versions of authentik prior to 2024.8.5 and 2024.10.3.
