  "reference_content": "- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the `Gitlab::Asciidoc::IncludeProcessor` not properly handling recursive includes using the `include::` directive in AsciiDoc files. Specifically, the `:include_allowed?` method doesn't prevent cyclic imports, leading to an infinite loop when two files include each other.\n\n- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n    -  Unrestricted recursive includes in AsciiDoc processing.\n    -  Lack of proper cycle detection in the `Gitlab::Asciidoc::IncludeProcessor`.\n    -  Inefficient processing of nested includes leading to resource exhaustion.\n\n- **Impact of exploitation:**\n    - Denial of Service (DoS): The infinite loop caused by recursive includes leads to excessive CPU consumption, eventually causing the request to timeout after 60 seconds and potentially affecting the entire site.\n    - Resource Exhaustion: The server's CPU is heavily utilized due to the infinite loop.\n\n- **Attack vectors:**\n    -  Uploading specially crafted AsciiDoc files that include each other recursively using the `include::` directive.\n    -  Accessing these malicious files through the web interface which triggers the `Gitlab::Asciidoc::IncludeProcessor`.\n\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n    - The attacker needs to be able to create or modify AsciiDoc files within a GitLab repository.\n    - The attacker needs to have access to the GitLab instance (user account) to exploit this vulnerability",

While CWE-400 is a broader classification, CWE-770 provides more specific details about the **allocation of resources without limits**, which is more aligned with the vulnerability details. Additionally, CWE-1333 was considered because the resource consumption stemmed from inefficient processing.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe1333[\"CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\"]\n    \n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    cwe1333 -->|PEEROF| cwe400\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe400 primary\n    class cwe770,cwe1333 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper handling of recursive includes** in AsciiDoc files, leading to an infinite loop. This loop results in excessive CPU consumption, ultimately causing a denial of service.\n  - **Root Cause:** **Improper handling of recursive includes** (`Gitlab::Asciidoc::IncludeProcessor` not preventing cyclic imports).\n  - **Weakness 1:** **Allocation of resources without limits** (CWE-770) due to the infinite loop.\n  - **Weakness 2:** Inefficient processing (CWE-1333) of nested includes.\n  - **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) (CWE-400) due to resource exhaustion.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary assessment is based on the provided evidence, particularly the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section, which states that the vulnerability stems from the `Gitlab::Asciidoc::IncludeProcessor` not properly handling recursive includes, leading to an infinite loop and resource exhaustion.\n\nThe relationship between CWE-400 and CWE-770 influenced the final selection. While CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) is a high-level classification, CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) provides a more specific explanation of the **root cause**. CWE-1333 was considered as another factor contributing to the resource exhaustion.\n\nCWE-400 is selected despite it being discouraged. The vulnerability leads to an uncontrolled consumption of CPU resources due to the infinite loop, leading to a denial of service. The retriever also listed CWE-400 as the top combined result. The evidence states \"The infinite loop caused by recursive includes leads to excessive CPU consumption, eventually causing the request to timeout after 60 seconds and potentially affecting the entire site.\"\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1286: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input that is expected to be well-formed - i.e., to comply with a certain syntax - but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input complies with the syntax.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-88: Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs a string for a command to be executed by a separate component\nin another control sphere, but it does not properly delimit the\nintended arguments, options, or switches within that command string.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-93: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses CRLF (carriage return line feeds) as a special element, e.g. to separate lines or records, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CRLF sequences from inputs.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product generates an error message that includes sensitive information about its environment, users, or associated data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
