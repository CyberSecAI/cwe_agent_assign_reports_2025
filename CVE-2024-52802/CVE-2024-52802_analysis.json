  "cve_id": "CVE-2024-52802",
  "description": "RIOT is an operating system for internet of things (IoT) devices. In version 2024.04 and prior, the function `_parse_advertise`, located in `/sys/net/application_layer/dhcpv6/client.c`, has **no minimum header length check** for `dhcpv6_opt_t` after processing `dhcpv6_msg_t`. This omission could lead to an **out-of-bound read**, causing system inconsistency. Additionally, the same lack of a header length check is present in the function `_preparse_advertise`, which is called by `_parse_advertise` before handling the request. As of time of publication, no known patched version exists.",

  "reference_content": "- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the absence of minimum header length checks for `dhcpv6_opt_t` within the `_parse_advertise` and `_preparse_advertise` functions in `/sys/net/application_layer/dhcpv6/client.c` after processing a `dhcpv6_msg_t`.\n- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:\n    - Out-of-bounds read vulnerability due to lack of length validation on DHCPv6 options.\n    - Insufficient input validation, specifically missing header length checks after `dhcpv6_msg_t` processing.\n    - Use of potentially unsafe operations, like accessing `opt->type` without ensuring adequate remaining data.\n- **Impact of exploitation**: An out-of-bounds read can lead to system instability and inconsistency. It can cause a denial of service or allow for further exploitation.\n- **Attack vectors**: Network. The vulnerability can be triggered by sending crafted DHCPv6 messages.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send a malicious DHCPv6 message to the vulnerable system. No special privileges are needed on the target system.\n\nThe provided content gives more details than the initial CVE description which was a placeholder.",

However, given the specific nature of the vulnerability, CWE-125 is the more appropriate choice.\n    *   The official MITRE mapping guidance allows the use of CWE-125.\n*   **CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input**\n    *   The vulnerability stems from the **lack of** minimum header length checks, indicating that the product does not properly validate the size or length of the input.\n    *   This weakness can lead to other vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows or out-of-bounds reads, as seen in this case.\n    *   The official MITRE mapping guidance allows the use of CWE-1284.\n\nCWEs Considered but Not Used:\n\n*   CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation): While the vulnerability does involve input validation, CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input) is a more specific and accurate representation of the **lack of** header length checks.\n*   CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) and CWE-191 (Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)): These CWEs were considered due to the potential for integer-related issues in length calculations. However, the primary issue is the **lack of** validation rather than an overflow or underflow.\n*   CWE-120 (Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')): This CWE was considered, but the vulnerability description explicitly mentions an out-of-bounds read, not a buffer copy without checking size.\n*   CWE-755 (Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions) and CWE-390 (Detection of Error Condition Without Action): Although errors are likely occurring, the root cause is **lack of** input validation and result in out-of-bounds read, making those other CWEs less relevant.",
