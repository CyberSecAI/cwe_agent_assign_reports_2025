Prior to version 2.0.8, the `ejson2env` tool has a vulnerability related to how it writes to `stdout`. Specifically, the tool is intended to write an export statement for environment variables and their values. However, due to **inadequate **output sanitization****, there is a potential risk where variable names or values may include malicious content, resulting in additional unintended commands being output to `stdout`. If this output is improperly utilized in further command execution, it could lead to **command injection**, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the host system. Version 2.0.8 sanitizes output during decryption. Other mitigations involve avoiding use of `ejson2env` to decrypt untrusted user secrets and/or avoiding evaluating or executing the direct output from `ejson2env` without removing nonprintable characters.', key_phrases={'rootcause': 'inadequate output sanitization', 'weakness': ['output sanitization', 'command injection'], 'impact': ['execute arbitrary commands', 'command execution'], 'vector': '', 'attacker': '', 'product': 'ejson2env', 'version': 'prior to 2.0.8', 'component': ''}, reference_content='```text\\nBased on the provided content, I can extract the following information about CVE-2025-48069:\\n\\n*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `ejson2env` tool has a vulnerability related to how it writes to `stdout`. Specifically, the tool is intended to write an export statement for environment variables and their values. However, due to inadequate output sanitization, there is a potential risk where variable names or values may include malicious content, resulting in additional unintended commands being output to `stdout`. The vulnerability exists because environment variables are not properly sanitized during the decryption phase, which enables malicious keys or encrypted values to inject commands.\\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insufficient input sanitization in `ejson2env`. Command injection vulnerability.\\n*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with control over `.ejson` files can inject commands in the environment where `source $(ejson2env)` or `eval ejson2env` are executed. This could lead to command injection vulnerabilities, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the host system.\\n*   **Attack vectors:** An attacker can inject commands in the environment where `source $(ejson2env)` or `eval ejson2env` are executed.\\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker with control over `.ejson` files.\\n*   **Mitigation or fix:**\\n    *   Update to a version of `ejson2env` that sanitizes the output during decryption or\\n    *   Do not use `ejson2env` to decrypt untrusted user secrets or\\n    *   Do not evaluate or execute the direct output from `ejson2env` without removing nonprintable characters.\\n\\nThis content provides more detail than the official CVE description because it gives the root cause, attack vector, and mitigation steps, which may not be present in the standard CVE description.\\n```', similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {}, 'top_cwes_by_threshold': {}}}, similarity_summary=SimilarityInsight(consensus_cwe='', top_cwes=[], confidence_levels={}, total_samples=0), analysis='', analysis_with_relationships='', criticism='', resolution='', relevant_cwes=[{'metadata': {'doc_id': '116', 'name': 'Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.

    "enhanced_query": "# Vulnerability Description\n\n    ejson2env allows users to decrypt EJSON secrets and export them as environment variables. Prior to version 2.0.8, the `ejson2env` tool has a vulnerability related to how it writes to `stdout`. Specifically, the tool is intended to write an export statement for environment variables and their values. However, due to **inadequate **output sanitization****, there is a potential risk where variable names or values may include malicious content, resulting in additional unintended commands being output to `stdout`. If this output is improperly utilized in further command execution, it could lead to **command injection**, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the host system. Version 2.0.8 sanitizes output during decryption. Other mitigations involve avoiding use of `ejson2env` to decrypt untrusted user secrets and/or avoiding evaluating or executing the direct output from `ejson2env` without removing nonprintable characters.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'inadequate output sanitization'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1. CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output (Score: 777.30)\n\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
