  "description": "An **Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File** vulnerability in Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows a local, authenticated attacker with high privileges to access sensitive information. When another user performs a specific operation, sensitive information is stored as plain text in a specific log file, so that a high-privileged attacker has access to this information. This issue affects Junos OS * All versions before 22.1R2-S2, * 22.1R3 and later versions, * 22.2 versions before 22.2R2-S1, 22.2R3, * 22.3 versions before 22.3R1-S2, 22.3R2 Junos OS Evolved * All versions before before 22.1R3-EVO, * 22.2-EVO versions before 22.2R2-S1-EVO, 22.2R3-EVO, * 22.3-EVO versions before 22.3R1-S1-EVO, 22.3R2-EVO.",

A local, authenticated attacker with high privileges then accesses this log file to retrieve the sensitive information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe vulnerability description clearly states an \"**Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File**\" which directly corresponds to CWE-532. The attacker's ability to access this information due to their high privileges highlights a potential issue with privilege management. The analysis is heavily based on the explicit description of the weakness.\n\nCWE-532 is the most specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability.\n\nCWE-267 was considered as a secondary candidate because the attacker required high privileges to access the log file. It is possible the privileges were not correctly defined, allowing the attacker to access information they should not have. However, the primary issue is the logging of sensitive information, not the privilege definition itself.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions. This may cause it to follow unexpected code paths that may leave the product in an invalid state.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not check or incorrectly checks for unusual or exceptional conditions that are not expected to occur frequently during day to day operation of the product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly anticipate or handle exceptional conditions that rarely occur during normal operation of the product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.\n\n\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.\n\n\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 1517.31\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly assign, modify, track, or check privileges for an actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-269 is commonly misused. It can be conflated with \"privilege escalation,\" which is a technical impact that is listed in many low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is not useful for trend analysis.\n\n\n\n## CWE-252: Unchecked Return Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 1444.91\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not check the return value from a method or function, which can prevent it from detecting unexpected states and conditions.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- R",
