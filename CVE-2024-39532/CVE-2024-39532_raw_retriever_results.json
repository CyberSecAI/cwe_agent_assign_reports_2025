  "query": "An Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File vulnerability in Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows a local, authenticated attacker with high privileges to access sensitive information. When another user performs a specific operation, sensitive information is stored as plain text in a specific log file, so that a high-privileged attacker has access to this information. This issue affects Junos OS * All versions before 22.1R2-S2, * 22.1R3 and later versions, * 22.2 versions before 22.2R2-S1, 22.2R3, * 22.3 versions before 22.3R1-S2, 22.3R2 Junos OS Evolved * All versions before before 22.1R3-EVO, * 22.2-EVO versions before 22.2R2-S1-EVO, 22.2R3-EVO, * 22.3-EVO versions before 22.3R1-S1-EVO, 22.3R2-EVO.",
