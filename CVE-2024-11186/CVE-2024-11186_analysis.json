Here's an extraction of the relevant information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\n* Improper access controls in the CloudVision Portal.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n* CWE-284: Improper Access Control.  A malicious authenticated user can take broader actions on managed EOS devices than intended.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*  An authenticated malicious user could perform unauthorized actions on managed EOS devices. (High impact - CVSS score 9.9)\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n* Requires authentication with CloudVision.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n* Authenticated user with malicious intent.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n* **Workaround:** Append the following to `/etc/nginx/conf.d/locations/cvp.https.conf` on all CVP nodes:\n```\nlocation ^~ /cvpservice/di/ {\n    return 404;\n}\n```\nThen restart nginx using `nginx-app.sh reload`.\n* **Resolution:** Upgrade to the following versions or later:\n    * 2025.1.0 and later releases in the 2025.1.x train\n    * 2024.3.1 and later releases in the 2024.3.x train\n    * 2024.2.2 and later releases in the 2024.2.x train\n    * 2024.1.3 and later releases in the 2024.1.x train\n\n**Affected Software:**\n\n* CloudVision Portal versions 2024.3.0 and below, 2024.2.1 and below, 2024.1.2 and below, and all releases in the 2023.x, 2022.x, 2021.x, 2020.x, 2019.1.x, 2018.2.x, 2018.1.x, and 2017.2.x trains.\n\n**Unaffected Software:**\n\n* Arista EOS-based products (a comprehensive list is provided in the advisory).\n* CloudVision as-a-Service\n* Other Arista products (listed in the advisory).\n\n**Indicators of Compromise:**\n\n* CLI commands sent to devices logged in the device-interaction app starting with \u201cRequest to execute:\u201d. Also, check device Radius/TACACS logs for suspicious activity.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n* The issue was discovered internally by Arista.\n* Arista is not aware of any malicious exploitation in customer networks.\n* Bug tracking ID: BUG 1029707.\n\nThis content provides significantly more detail than the placeholder CVE description.",

While it broadly fits, the retriever results and the nature of the vulnerability suggest a more specific CWE might be appropriate. CWE-285, Improper Authorization, is a child of CWE-284 and represents a more refined classification. However, since the provided description and CVE summary don't give a precise method of how the authorization was bypassed, using the more general CWE-284 is safer.

The CVE Reference Links Content Summary explicitly mentions **CWE-284: Improper Access Control** as well.\n\nWhile CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) is a more specific child of CWE-284, the vulnerability description does not provide enough detail to definitively say that an authorization check was performed incorrectly.
