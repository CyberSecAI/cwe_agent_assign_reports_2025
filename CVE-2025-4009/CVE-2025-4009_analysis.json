  "description": "The Evertz SDVN 3080ipx-10G is a High Bandwidth Ethernet Switching Fabric for Video Application. This device exposes a web management interface on port 80. This web management interface can be used by administrators to control product features, setup network switching, and register license among other features. The application has been developed in PHP with the webEASY SDK, also named ewb by Evertz. This web interface has two endpoints that are vulnerable to arbitrary command injection and the authentication mechanism has a flaw leading to authentication bypass. Remote unauthenticated attackers can gain arbitrary command execution with elevated privileges ( root ) on affected devices. This level of access could lead to serious business impact such as the interruption of media streaming, modification of media being streamed, alteration of closed captions being generated, among others.",

  "reference_content": "## Security Advisory: Remote Code Execution on Evertz SDVN (CVE-2025-4009)\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\n*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of input sanitization in the `feature-transfer-import.php` and `feature-transfer-export.php` files. These files construct commands using user-controlled parameters (`action`, `filename`, and `slot`) without proper validation, leading to arbitrary command injection.\n*   An authentication bypass exists in `usr/htdocs/login.php` due to a flawed implementation of preauthorized users, allowing unauthenticated users to gain access as administrators by crafting a valid base64 encoded JSON structure.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Command Injection\n*   Authentication Bypass\n*   Lack of Input Validation\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   Remote unauthenticated attackers can gain arbitrary command execution with elevated privileges (root) on affected devices.\n*   Potential business impact includes interruption of media streaming, modification of streamed media, and alteration of closed captions.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Sending crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoints (`/v.1.5/php/features/feature-transfer-import.php` and `/v.1.5/php/features/feature-transfer-export.php`) with malicious parameters.\n*   Exploiting the authentication bypass in `usr/htdocs/login.php` by sending a crafted base64 encoded JSON structure to gain administrator access.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   Unauthenticated remote attacker.\n*   Ability to send HTTP requests.\n*   Understanding of command injection techniques and base64 encoding.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   The advisory does not specify a fixed version or mitigation. It recommends isolating the web management interfaces from untrusted networks, applying network-level access controls, and monitoring for anomalous web requests or shell-spawning processes.\n\n**Affected Products:**\n\n*   Evertz SDVN 3080ipx-10G (confirmed)\n*   Evertz MViP-II\n*   Evertz cVIP\n*   Evertz 7890IXG\n*   Evertz CC Access Server\n*   Evertz 5782XPS-APP-4E\n*   ewb v.1.4, v1.5, v1.6 (confirmed)\n\n**CVSS:** CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/S:N/AU:Y/V:C (9.3 - Critical)\n\n**Note:** This content provides more detail than the official CVE description, including specific file paths, example requests, and a detailed explanation of the authentication bypass.",
