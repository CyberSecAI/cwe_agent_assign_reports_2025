Due to improper user input validation, it is possible to upload dangerous files, for instance PHP code, to the C-MOR system. By analyzing the C-MOR web interface, it was found out that the upload functionality for backup files allows an authenticated user to upload arbitrary files. The only condition is that the filename contains a .cbkf string. Therefore, webshell.cbkf.php is considered a valid file name for the C-MOR web application. Uploaded files are stored within the directory /srv/www/backups on the C-MOR system, and can thus be accessed via the URL https///backup/upload_. Due to broken access control, low-privileged authenticated users can also use this file upload functionality.",
