CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow) is also relevant because the vulnerability occurs on the stack. The relationships show a hierarchical structure where specific buffer overflow types (like stack-based) are children of more general out-of-bounds read/write weaknesses.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe126[\"CWE-126: Buffer Over-read\"]\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe121[\"CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    \n    cwe126 -->|CHILDOF| cwe125\n    cwe121 -->|RELATED| cwe126\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe126 primary\n    class cwe125,cwe121 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **stack-based buffer over-read** in `TS_program_map_section::extractPMTDescriptors` due to insufficient bounds checking. This leads to information disclosure because an attacker can read data beyond the intended buffer. The chain is: Insufficient bounds checking -> Stack buffer over-read -> Information Disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis strongly supports CWE-126 (Buffer Over-read) as the primary CWE because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions a \"**stack-based buffer over-read**\" which is further supported by the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" that mentions \"**stack buffer over-read** in `TS_program_map_section::extractPMTDescriptors`\". This aligns perfectly with the definition of CWE-126 as reading beyond the targeted buffer. CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow) is also relevant as the overflow occurs on the stack, but the primary issue is the over-read. CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) is a more general case of CWE-126, but CWE-126 is more specific and therefore a better fit.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following

Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which

larger than\n         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is\n         incremented to a value that is too large to store in the\n         associated representation.
