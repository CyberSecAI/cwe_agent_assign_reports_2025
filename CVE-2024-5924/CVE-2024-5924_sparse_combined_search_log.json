This vulnerability allows remote attackers to bypass the Mark-of-the-Web protection mechanism on affected installations of Dropbox Desktop. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the handling of shared folders.
