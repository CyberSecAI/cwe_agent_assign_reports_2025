The **rootcause** is **missing CSRF protection**.\n\nThe evidence supporting CWE-352 includes the vulnerability description key phrases: \"**rootcause: missing CSRF protection**\" and the CVE reference links content summary, which states: \"The vulnerability allows a malicious actor to force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.\"\n\nThe evidence supporting CWE-79 includes the vulnerability description key phrases: \"**weakness: cross-site scripting, XSS**\" and \"**impact: Stored XSS**\".\n\nThe Retriever Results list CWE-79 as the top result, but it is the impact, not the root cause. CWE-352 is also listed, confirming its relevance.\n\nThe relationship graph shows that CWE-79 can be a resulting impact of CWE-352. This aligns with the vulnerability description, where the **missing CSRF protection** allows for Stored XSS.\n\nI am selecting CWE-352 as the primary CWE because it represents the **rootcause** of the vulnerability and CWE-79 as the secondary CWE representing the resulting impact. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-352 being a Compound and CWE-79 being a Base level weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.\n\n## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
