# Enhanced Analysis for CVE-2025-26543

# Summary

| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-352 | Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) | 1.0 | Compound | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-79 | Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that influenced the decision was the direct mention of **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** in the vulnerability description, which aligns well with CWE-352. The secondary relationship is that the **impact** of the **CSRF** vulnerability leads to Stored XSS (CWE-79), suggesting a CANPRECEDE relationship where CWE-352 enables CWE-79. CWE-352 is a Compound weakness, while CWE-79 is a Base weakness. Choosing CWE-352 accurately captures the **root cause**, with the resulting XSS attack being a consequence of the **CSRF**.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** (CWE-352), which allows an attacker to trick a user into performing actions they did not intend. This leads to Stored XSS (CWE-79) because the attacker can inject malicious scripts through the **CSRF** vulnerability.

CWE-352 (Root Cause) -> CWE-79 (Impact)

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis clearly points to **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** as the primary vulnerability. The description explicitly mentions "**Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** vulnerability...allows Stored XSS." This statement directly supports the selection of CWE-352 as the primary weakness. The **impact** of the vulnerability is Stored XSS, which is a consequence of the **CSRF**, supporting the choice of CWE-79 as a secondary weakness. The evidence is "allows Stored XSS", and the "Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)." from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary.

The graph relationships further reinforce this decision. CWE-352 is the enabler, and CWE-79 is the result. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-352 being a Compound weakness that accurately captures the **CSRF**, and CWE-79 being a Base weakness representing the XSS **impact**.

CWEs considered but not used:

*   CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output - While encoding issues can contribute to XSS, the primary issue is the **CSRF** that enables the injection in the first place.
*   CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') - This is not relevant as SQL injection is not mentioned.
*   CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type - This is not relevant as file uploads are not mentioned.
*   CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing') - While related to authorization, **CSRF** is the more specific vulnerability.
*   CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS) - This is a variant of CWE-79, which is already considered.

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
**Abstraction Level**: Compound
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.



## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web server receives a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as "<", ">", and "&" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-346: Origin Validation Error
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly verify that the source of data or communication is valid.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key
