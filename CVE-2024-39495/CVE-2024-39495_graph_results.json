  "query": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved greybus Fix use-after-free bug in gb_interface_release due to race condition. In gb_interface_create, &intf->mode_switch_completion is bound with gb_interface_mode_switch_work. Then it will be started by gb_interface_request_mode_switch. Here is the relevant code. if (!queue_work(system_long_wq, &intf->mode_switch_work)) { ... } If we call gb_interface_release to make cleanup, there may be an unfinished work. This function will call kfree to free the object intf. However, if gb_interface_mode_switch_work is scheduled to run after kfree, it may cause use-after-free error as gb_interface_mode_switch_work will use the object intf. The possible execution flow that may lead to the issue is as follows CPU0 CPU1 | gb_interface_create | gb_interface_request_mode_switch gb_interface_release | kfree(intf) (free) | | gb_interface_mode_switch_work | mutex_lock(&intf->mutex) (use) Fix it by canceling the work before kfree.",
