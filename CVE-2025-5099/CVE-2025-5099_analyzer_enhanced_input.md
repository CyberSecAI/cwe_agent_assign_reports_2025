## Vulnerability Description
An **Out of Bounds Write** occurs when the native library attempts PDF rendering, which can be exploited to achieve memory corruption and potentially arbitrary code execution.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **component:** native library
- **weakness:** **Out of Bounds Write**
- **product:** PDF rendering
- **impact:** memory corruption, potentially arbitrary code execution

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-5099 Content

This content **relates** to CVE-2025-5099. It provides significantly more detail than the placeholder CVE description.

**1. Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient bounds checking on pointers within the `libpdfrender.so` native library when processing PDF files. Specifically, memory operations are performed without proper validation, allowing manipulation of memory via crafted inputs.

**2. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer**
*   **CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write**
*   Out-of-bounds write in the `PDFrender.drawPage` function.

**3. Impact of exploitation:**

Successful exploitation can lead to:

*   Memory corruption
*   Potentially arbitrary code execution

**4. Attack vectors:**

*   Processing manipulated PDF files with extreme dimensions (e.g., 0x7FFFFFFF or INT\_MAX).
*   The vulnerability is accessible through the exported `ActivityPrintDocuments` class.
*   The Frida script demonstrates exploiting the vulnerability by hooking `Java\_com\_dynamixsoftware\_printershare\_PDFrender\_drawPage` and providing a malformed PDF.

**5. Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted PDF file to the application.
*   The target Activity is exported, meaning any application with appropriate permissions can interact with it.
*   The provided proof of concept uses Frida for dynamic instrumentation and exploitation, requiring a rooted Android device and Frida client/server setup.

**6. Mitigation or fix:**

*   No response from the vendor was received at the time of the advisory's publication.
*   No known mitigations are available to end-users.

**Technical Details:**

*   **Affected Vendor:** Mobile Dynamix
*   **Affected Product:** PrinterShare Mobile Print
*   **Affected Version:** up to 12.15.01
*   **Platform:** Android
*   The vulnerable function is `PDFrender.drawPage` in `libpdfrender.so`.
*   The Frida script hooks `Java\_com\_dynamixsoftware\_printershare\_PDFrender\_drawPage`.
*   The proof of concept (PoC) modifies a vtable pointer in memory, leading to a crash and demonstrating memory corruption.
*   The crash occurs due to a SIGSEGV (segmentation fault) with a fault address of 0x0041414141414000.
