Given the information provided, there isn't enough detail to select a more specific child. The chain relationship isn't explicitly defined, but the uncontrolled resource consumption can be seen as a consequence of the authorization bypass. Abstraction levels guided the choice to stay at the class level for authorization due to lack of precise details.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    \n    cwe400 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe863\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe400 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **Incorrect Authorization** (CWE-863), where view-only users are able to access an API (`run_soon`) they should not have access to. This leads to **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption** (CWE-400) as the view-only users can trigger alerting rules continuously, potentially affecting system availability. The root cause is the **incorrect authorization**, and the impact is the potential resource exhaustion.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-863 as the primary weakness due to the **broken access control** allowing unauthorized access to the `run_soon` API. The retriever results also listed CWE-863 as the top candidate. The vulnerability description and CVE summary both point to an authorization issue as the root cause. CWE-400 was considered because the continuous triggering of alerting rules could lead to resource exhaustion, which is an impact of the authorization bypass.\n\nThe assessment is largely based on the provided evidence, specifically:\n*   \"**Root cause of vulnerability:** A **broken access control flaw** in Kibana's alerting functionality.\"\n*   \"**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** `view-only` users of alerting can use the `run_soon` API which is not intended for them.\"\n*   \"**Impact of exploitation:** `view-only` users can trigger alerting rules to run continuously, potentially affecting system availability, especially if the rules involve complex queries.\"\n\nThe graph relationships helped clarify the chain of events, with the authorization issue leading to resource consumption. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity given the available information. While CWE-863 is a class-level CWE, the evidence doesn't allow for a more specific base-level classification within the authorization category.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.67\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-612: Improper Authorization of Index Containing Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.67\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product creates a search index of private or sensitive documents, but it does not properly limit index access to actors who are authorized to see the original information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.66\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
