  "description": "Discord-Bot-Framework-Kernel is a Discord bot framework built with interactions.py, featuring modular extension management and secure execution. Because of the nature of **arbitrary user-submited code execution**, this allows user to execute potentially malicious code to perform damage or extract sensitive information. By loading the module containing the following code and run the command, the bot token can be extracted. Then the attacker can load a blocking module to sabotage the bot (DDoS attack) and the token can be used to make the fake bot act as the real one. If the bot has very high privilege, the attacker basically has full control before the user kicks the bot. Any Discord user that hosts Discord-Bot-Framework-Kernel before commit f0d9e70841a0e3170b88c4f8d562018ccd8e8b14 is affected. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may attempt to limit their discord bots access via configuration options.",

While the description doesn't explicitly mention PHP, the underlying issue of code injection is well-represented by CWE-94. The other considered CWEs showed various relationships, but none were as directly applicable as CWE-94.

The chain highlights how insecure code execution can lead to a cascade of security impacts, including complete control over the bot.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe primary CWE, CWE-94, directly addresses the **root cause** of the vulnerability: **arbitrary user-submitted code execution**. This aligns with the vulnerability description, which states that the issue stems from allowing users to execute potentially malicious code. CWE-472 and CWE-201 have been added as secondary CWEs due to the potential for external control and sensitive information exposure respectively.\n\nThe decision is heavily based on the provided evidence, particularly the phrase \"**arbitrary user-submitted code execution**\". This clearly points to CWE-94 as the primary weakness.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at an appropriate level of specificity. While broader classifications exist, CWE-94 accurately captures the essence of code injection.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
