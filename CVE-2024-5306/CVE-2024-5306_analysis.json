  "description": "Kofax Power PDF PDF File Parsing Memory Corruption Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Kofax Power PDF. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of PDF files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a **memory corruption** condition. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-22930.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided advisory, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n* **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of PDF files within Kofax Power PDF. This inadequate validation leads to a memory corruption condition.\n* **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The core weakness is insufficient input validation, specifically regarding data present in a PDF file. This leads to a memory corruption vulnerability.\n* **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process, potentially leading to complete system compromise.\n* **Attack Vectors:** The primary attack vector involves a malicious PDF file. The victim must open this specially crafted file in Kofax Power PDF to trigger the vulnerability. Alternatively, user interaction can be through a malicious page which leads to the opening of a malicious PDF.\n* **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs the capability to create a malicious PDF file and deliver it to the target user. They need the target user to open the malicious PDF in Kofax Power PDF.\n\nThis advisory provides more specific details than the placeholder CVE description, outlining the root cause, impact, and attack vectors.",

Usage is Discouraged for CWE-119.\n*   CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read was considered but not used because the vulnerability description specifically mentions **memory corruption**, which implies writing to memory, rather than reading.\n*   CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow') was considered but not used because the description does not mention a buffer copy operation.\n*   CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow was considered but not used because the description doesn't explicitly mention the heap. While memory corruption can often involve the heap, without explicit confirmation, it's better to stick to the more general CWE-787.\n*   CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound was considered but not used because there is no mention of an integer overflow or wraparound in the description.",

The chosen CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-787 being a Base-level CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n*   CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write. The product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n*   CWE-20: Improper Input Validation. The product receives input or data, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input has the properties that are required to process the data safely and correctly.\n\nCWEs Considered but Not Used:\n\n*   CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer was considered but not used because CWE-787 is a more specific child that more accurately describes the vulnerability. Usage is Discouraged for CWE-119.\n*   CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read was considered but not used because the vulnerability description specifically mentions **memory corruption**, which implies writing to memory, rather than reading.\n*   CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow') was considered but not used because the description does not mention a buffer copy operation.\n*   CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow was considered but not used because the description doesn't explicitly mention the heap. While memory corruption can often involve the heap, without explicit confirmation, it's better to stick to the more general CWE-787.\n*   CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound was considered but not used because there is no mention of an integer overflow or wraparound in the description.\n\n\n## CWE Relationship Analysis\n\nCurrent CWEs represent these abstraction levels: .\n\n\n### Vulnerability Chain Analysis\n\n**Chain starting from CWE-125:**\n- 125 (Out-of-bounds Read) - ROOT\n\n\n**Chain starting from CWE-787:**\n- 787 (Out-of-bounds Write) - ROOT\n\n\n\n### CWE Relationship Diagram\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n```",
