## Vulnerability Description
arduino-esp32 is an Arduino core for the ESP32, ESP32-S2, ESP32-S3, ESP32-C3, ESP32-C6 and ESP32-H2 microcontrollers. The `arduino-esp32` CI is vulnerable to **multiple Poisoned Pipeline Execution (PPE) vulnerabilities**. Code injection in `tests_results.yml` workflow (`GHSL-2024-169`) and environment Variable injection (`GHSL-2024-170`). These issue have been addressed but users are advised to verify the contents of the downloaded artifacts.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **impact:** Code injection in tests_results.yml workflow and environment Variable injection
- **product:** arduino-esp32

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-45798:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the use of untrusted input within GitHub Actions workflows, specifically within the `tests_results.yml` workflow. This workflow downloads artifacts from a previous workflow and uses data from those artifacts in insecure ways, leading to command injection and environment variable injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Code Injection (GHSL-2024-169):**  The workflow interpolates user-controlled data (specifically, the `original_ref` environment variable, obtained from an artifact) into a JavaScript script executed by the `actions/github-script` action. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code.
2.  **Environment Variable Injection (GHSL-2024-170):** The workflow creates environment variables using data read directly from the downloaded artifacts and redirects it to `$GITHUB_ENV`. An attacker can inject arbitrary content including bash commands to be executed when these environment variables are expanded.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Repository Takeover:** Successful exploitation of either vulnerability can lead to a complete repository takeover. The attacker gains control over a GitHub token with `Actions: write`, `Checks: write`, `Contents: write`, `PullRequests: write`, and `Statuses: write` permissions.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The attacker can execute arbitrary code within the GitHub Actions environment. This includes exfiltrating secrets, modifying repository contents, or performing other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Poisoned Artifacts:** The attacker modifies a separate GitHub Actions workflow (in this case `tests_wokwi.yml`), to upload malicious files as artifacts. These files contain the malicious payloads designed to exploit the `tests_results.yml` workflow.
*   **Triggering Workflow:** The attacker creates a pull request with the modified workflow, triggering the vulnerable `tests_results.yml` workflow upon completion of the modified workflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Create Pull Requests:** The attacker needs the ability to create pull requests on the targeted repository to inject malicious artifacts.
*   **Understanding of GitHub Actions:** The attacker needs some knowledge of how GitHub Actions workflows function to craft the exploit.
*   **Indirect Code Injection:** The attacker does not directly modify the vulnerable workflow itself but injects malicious payloads into intermediate artifacts that the vulnerable workflow uses.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was present in the `arduino-esp32` repository.
*   The vulnerability was introduced in commit `26db8cba32e77050f177e8cb0f879614c57bc5f2`.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in commit `a7cec020df8f1a815bd8dfd2559f51a2216bcf1c`.
*   The advisory also provides a proof of concept (PoC) for each vulnerability.
*   The provided documentation also includes references to additional resources regarding GitHub Actions security.
*   The severity is rated as critical.
*   The weaknesses are classified as CWE-20, CWE-78, and CWE-94.

This detailed breakdown provides a comprehensive understanding of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2024-45798.
