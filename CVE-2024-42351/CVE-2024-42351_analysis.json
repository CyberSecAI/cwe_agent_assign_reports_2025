  "description": "Galaxy is a free, open-source system for analyzing data, authoring workflows, training and education, publishing tools, managing infrastructure, and more. An attacker can potentially replace the contents of public datasets resulting in data loss or tampering. All supported branches of Galaxy (and more back to release_21.05) were amended with the below patch. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-42351:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from the Galaxy platform's dataset import functionality, specifically how it handles UUIDs during dataset imports.  Prior to the patch, the system directly set the UUID of a dataset based on the provided `dataset_attrs` during an import process. This allowed external or malicious actors to overwrite the UUID with their own specified value if they had the ability to import data with the `allow_edit` setting enabled.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Unrestricted Dataset UUID Modification:** The core weakness is the ability to directly set the dataset UUID based on user-provided input during import. This allowed potentially unauthorized modification of dataset metadata (UUID).\n*   **Data Tampering:** An attacker could exploit this to potentially replace the contents of public datasets by manipulating the UUID. This is because the UUID is used to identify the dataset.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Data Loss:** By replacing a dataset's UUID, an attacker can effectively make it inaccessible and potentially overwrite it.\n*   **Data Tampering:** An attacker can replace the actual content of a public dataset with their own data, leading to potential data corruption or malicious content injection.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Dataset Import with `allow_edit`:** An attacker needs to have the ability to import datasets into the Galaxy platform with `allow_edit` option enabled.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Access to Galaxy with Dataset Import Privileges**: An attacker would need to have a user account with permissions to import data into a Galaxy instance with the `allow_edit` option enabled, and be able to control `dataset_attrs` in the import process.\n\n**Patch Information:**\n\nThe provided patch modifies the `handle_dataset_object_edit` function in `lib/galaxy/model/store/__init__.py`.  The change is that the UUID is set based on `dataset_attrs` only if `self.import_options.allow_edit` is `True`. This prevents unauthorized changes to the UUID and mitigates the vulnerability.\n\nThe vulnerability has been assigned **Moderate** severity.",

CWE-201 (**Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data**) is considered a secondary CWE. The relationship between these CWEs is not hierarchical. They represent different aspects of the vulnerability. CWE-863 is a class-level CWE, so it is broader in scope, while CWE-201 is at the base level.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe201 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **incorrect authorization** (CWE-863), which allows an attacker to modify the UUID of a dataset. This leads to **data tampering** and **data loss**, as the attacker can replace the contents of public datasets.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial assessment identified the **incorrect authorization** as the primary weakness, leading to the ability to **replace the contents of public datasets, resulting in data loss or tampering**. The selection of CWE-863 (**Incorrect Authorization**) is based on the fact that the system **does not correctly perform the authorization check** when setting the UUID of a dataset.\n\nThe evidence from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary supports this: \"The core weakness is the ability to directly set the dataset UUID based on user-provided input during import. This allowed potentially unauthorized modification of dataset metadata (UUID).\"\n\nCWE-201 (**Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data**) is also considered because \"the system directly set the UUID of a dataset based on the provided `dataset_attrs` during an import process.
