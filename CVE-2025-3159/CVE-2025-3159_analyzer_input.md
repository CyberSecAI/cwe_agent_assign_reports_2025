# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-3159

## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, was found in Open Asset Import Library Assimp 5.4.3. This affects the function AssimpASEParserParseLV4MeshBonesVertices of the file code/AssetLib/ASE/ASEParser.cpp of the component ASE File Handler. The manipulation leads to **heap-based buffer overflow**. The attack needs to be approached locally. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The identifier of the patch is e8a6286542924e628e02749c4f5ac4f91fdae71b. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **heap-based buffer overflow**
- **product:** Open Asset Import Library Assimp
- **version:** 5.4.3
- **component:** ASE File Handler

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The root cause is a heap buffer overflow in Assimp::ASE::Parser::ParseLV4MeshBonesVertices. In code/AssetLib/ASE/ASEParser.cpp:1408, iIndex was assigned to (unsigned int)mesh.mPositions.size() - 1, which is reading out of bound for mesh.mBoneVertices. It causes the push_back function to trigger a heap buffer overflow.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Heap-based buffer overflow and out-of-bounds read.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability to cause remote code execution.
- Attack vectors: An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by tricking the victim into running assimp on a malformed ASE file.
- Mitigation or fix: The issue is closed by commit e8a6286, which uses the correct vertex container.
- More detail than official CVE description: The content provides the exact location of the vulnerability in the source code and details of the PoC.
