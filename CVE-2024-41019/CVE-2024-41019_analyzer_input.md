# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-41019

## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved fs/ntfs3 Validate ff offset This adds sanity checks for ff offset. There is a check on rt->first_free at first, but walking through by ff without any check. If the second ff is a large offset. We may encounter an **out-of-bound read**.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **out-of-bound read**
- **impact:** read past the end of the allocated memory
- **vector:** accessing second ff without any check
- **product:** Linux kernel
- **component:** fs/ntfs3

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2024-41019.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the ntfs3 filesystem driver's handling of the restart table (`RESTART_TABLE`). Specifically, when traversing the linked list of free areas using the `ff` (first free) offset, there is a lack of proper bounds checking. While the initial `rt->first_free` is checked, the subsequent `ff` offsets are not, leading to a potential out-of-bounds read.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Out-of-bounds read:** The vulnerability allows for reading memory outside the allocated buffer by providing a crafted `ff` offset within the `RESTART_TABLE`. The code iterates through free areas using `ff` without proper checks, allowing for a large `ff` offset to cause an out-of-bounds read.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information Leakage:** An attacker could potentially leak sensitive kernel memory by triggering an out-of-bounds read using a carefully crafted NTFS image. The attacker could potentially read data beyond the boundary of the allocated buffer when handling the `RESTART_TABLE` in `fs/ntfs3/fslog.c`

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious NTFS image:** An attacker can craft a malicious NTFS image with a specially crafted `RESTART_TABLE` to trigger the out-of-bounds read vulnerability. When the vulnerable driver attempts to mount or access this malicious image, the vulnerability will be triggered.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Ability to supply a crafted NTFS image:** The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious NTFS image to the vulnerable system. This could be through mounting a storage device or accessing a file on a remote file system.
