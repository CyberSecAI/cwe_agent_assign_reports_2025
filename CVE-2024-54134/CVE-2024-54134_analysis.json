  "description": "A publish-access account was compromised for `@solana/web3.js`, a JavaScript library that is commonly used by Solana dapps. This allowed an attacker to publish unauthorized and malicious packages that were modified, allowing them to steal private key material and drain funds from dapps, like bots, that handle private keys directly. This issue should not affect non-custodial wallets, as they generally do not expose private keys during transactions. This is not an issue with the Solana protocol itself, but with a specific JavaScript client library and only appears to affect projects that directly handle private keys and that updated within the window of 320pm UTC and 825pm UTC on Tuesday, December 3, 2024. These two unauthorized versions (1.95.6 and 1.95.7) were caught within hours and have since been unpublished. All Solana app developers should upgrade to version 1.95.8. Developers that suspect they might be compromised should rotate any suspect authority keys, including multisigs, program authorities, server keypairs, and so on.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:** A compromised publish-access account for the `@solana/web3.js` npm package allowed an attacker to publish malicious versions of the library.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n*   **Compromised Account:** An attacker gained control of a publish-access account for the npm package.\n*   **Malicious Code Injection:** The attacker injected malicious code into the library that exfiltrated private key material.\n*  **Supply Chain Vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the supply chain of the software. Attackers did not directly target vulnerable software but rather compromised the software update mechanism.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n*   **Private Key Theft:** The malicious code stole private key material from applications using the compromised library versions.\n*   **Fund Draining:** Stolen private keys could be used to drain funds from affected applications like bots that directly handle private keys.\n* **Data Breach**: The attack resulted in unauthorized access and exfiltration of confidential information (private keys).\n* **Financial Loss**: Affected users could face monetary loss due to the compromised private keys.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n*   **Network:** The attacker distributed the malicious code via the npm package repository, which is accessible over the network.\n*   **Supply Chain Attack**: The attacker didn't directly target vulnerable systems, but rather targeted a software update mechanism.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n*   **Compromised Account Access:** The attacker needed access to a legitimate publish-access account for the `@solana/web3.js` npm package.\n*   **Code Injection Ability**: The attacker must be able to modify the code of the library to add the malicious logic for key exfiltration.\n* **Network Access:**  The attacker needs network access to push the malicious package to the npm registry.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n*   The vulnerability affects versions 1.95.6 and 1.95.7 of the `@solana/web3.js` library.\n*   The malicious versions were live between 3:20 PM UTC and 8:25 PM UTC on December 3, 2024.\n*   The vulnerability primarily affects applications that directly handle private keys, such as bots.\n*   Non-custodial wallets are generally not affected, as they typically do not expose private keys during transactions.\n*   Users are advised to upgrade to version 1.95.8 and rotate any potentially compromised authority keys.\n\nThe CVSS v4 base score of 8.3 is also provided, along with the base metrics.",

CWE-1195 is a class-level CWE that covers a range of permission-related issues. The secondary CWE identified, CWE-200, represents a potential impact of the primary weakness, where sensitive information is exposed due to the compromised account. The abstraction levels influenced the decision to choose the class-level CWE-1195 because the description does not provide enough detail to pinpoint a more specific base or variant.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1195[\"CWE-1195: Permission Issues\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe200 -->|IMPACT| cwe1195\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1195 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **compromised publish-access account** (CWE-1195). This leads to the attacker being able to publish unauthorized and malicious packages, which in turn allows them to steal private key material and drain funds from dapps (CWE-200).\n  - **Root Cause:** CWE-1195 (Compromised Account)\n  - **Impact:** CWE-200 (Private Key Theft, Fund Draining)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified the **compromised publish-access account** as the root cause, leading to the selection of permission-related CWEs. The retriever results suggested CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor), CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization), and CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data). However, after further analysis, CWE-1195 (Permission Issues) at a Class level was deemed more appropriate to represent the broad issue of a **compromised account** with publishing privileges. CWE-200 was considered a secondary impact of the compromised account.\n\nThe decision to use CWE-1195 and CWE-200 is based on the provided evidence, specifically the vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary. The selection of CWE-1195 is at the optimal level of specificity, given the information available.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
