  "description": "The Simple Page Access Restriction plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to **Sensitive Information Exposure** in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.29 via the WordPress core search feature. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to extract sensitive data from posts that have been restricted to higher-level roles such as logged-in users.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability lies in the Simple Page Access Restriction plugin's failure to properly exclude restricted posts from WordPress core search queries. This allows unauthorized users to access restricted content through search results.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Inadequate Content Restriction:** The plugin's access restrictions were not applied to WordPress search functionality, leaving a loophole.\n- **Sensitive Information Exposure:** Restricted content was accessible to unauthenticated users through search results.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Unauthorized Access to Content:** Unauthenticated attackers can bypass the plugin's intended restrictions and view sensitive data in posts meant only for logged-in users or higher-level roles.\n- **Exposure of Sensitive Information:** This could include private content, confidential data, or any information that was intended to be restricted.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **WordPress Core Search Feature:** Attackers can exploit the WordPress search functionality to retrieve restricted content.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to be logged in or have any specific privileges on the WordPress site.\n- **Knowledge of Target Content:** The attacker would need to have some idea of the keywords that would be present in the restricted content to locate it through search.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n- The provided changelog from the plugin's trac indicates that version 1.0.30 addresses the issue by excluding restricted posts from GET and REST search queries.\n- Wordfence classified this vulnerability as having a CVSS score of 5.3 (Medium), indicating that it is a moderate risk.\n- The vulnerability is present in all versions of the plugin up to and including 1.0.29.",

However, based on the evidence provided, the core issue is the absence of an authorization check preventing access to restricted content via the WordPress search feature. CWE-200 **Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor** is a consequence of the **missing authorization**, not the root cause, and is therefore a secondary consideration. There is a potential chain of weakness where **Missing Authorization** leads to **Exposure of Sensitive Information**, but the primary concern is the lack of the initial authorization check.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe862 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authorization** check on the WordPress search feature. This **root cause** leads to the **impact** of **sensitive information exposure** to unauthorized users.\n\nMissing Authorization (CWE-862) -> Exposure of Sensitive Information (CWE-200)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified several potential CWEs, including CWE-863 **Incorrect Authorization**, CWE-639 **Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key**, and CWE-200 **Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor**. However, after careful consideration of the vulnerability description and the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\", it became clear that the primary issue is the **lack of an authorization check**, making CWE-862 **Missing Authorization** the most appropriate choice as the primary CWE. The vulnerability description explicitly states the plugin's \"failure to properly exclude restricted posts from WordPress core search queries.\" This **missing authorization** directly leads to the **exposure of sensitive information** to unauthenticated attackers, making CWE-200 a secondary concern representing the impact of the vulnerability.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-862 accurately represents the **root cause** of the vulnerability, and CWE-200 captures the immediate consequence. While CWE-862 is a Class-level CWE, the available information does not provide enough detail to pinpoint a more specific Base-level CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25
