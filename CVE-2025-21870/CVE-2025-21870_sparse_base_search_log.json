We could check for this NULL pointer in sof_ipc4_prepare_copier_module() and avoid the crash, but a similar loop in sof_ipc4_widget_setup_comp_dai() will miscalculate the ALH device count, causing broken audio. The correct fix is to harden the matching logic by making sure that the 1. widget is a DAI widget - so dai = w->private is valid 2. the dai (and thus the copier) is ALH copier",
