Starting with 9.1.0858, the tar.vim plugin uses the read ex command line to append below the cursor position, however the is not sanitized and is taken literally from the tar archive. This allows to execute shell commands via special crafted tar archives. Whether this really happens, depends on the shell being used (shell option, which is set using $SHELL).
