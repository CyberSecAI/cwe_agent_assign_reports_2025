While it could potentially have more specific child CWEs, the provided information does not give enough details to identify such a child. The secondary weakness is CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')), which is a base-level CWE. There isn't a direct parent-child relationship between CWE-862 and CWE-79, but they can exist within the same application.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe79 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **Missing Authorization (CWE-862)**, which allows unauthorized access. This, in turn, leads to the possibility of injecting malicious scripts, resulting in **Cross-Site Scripting (CWE-79)**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, which clearly states **\"Missing Authorization vulnerability\"** and the presence of stored **XSS**. The retriever results also support these findings, with CWE-862 and CWE-79 being top candidates. The guidance on authentication vs authorization helps confirm that the issue is related to authorization, as the attacker can access functionality without proper authorization checks. The selection of CWE-862 and CWE-79 is based on the specific evidence provided, making them the most appropriate and specific classifications.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25
