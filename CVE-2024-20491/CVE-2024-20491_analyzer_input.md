# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-20491

## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability in a logging function of Cisco Nexus Dashboard Insights could allow an attacker with access to a tech support file to view sensitive information. This vulnerability exists because remote controller credentials are recorded in an internal log that is stored in the tech support file. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing a tech support file that is generated from an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view remote controller admin credentials in clear text. Note Best practice is to store debug logs and tech support files safely and to share them only with trusted parties because they may contain sensitive information.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** view remote controller admin credentials in clear text
- **vector:** access tech support file
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** Cisco Nexus Dashboard Insights
- **component:** logging function

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists because remote controller credentials are recorded in an internal log that is stored in the tech support file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information disclosure due to sensitive information (remote controller admin credentials) being logged in tech support files.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with access to a tech support file can view remote controller admin credentials in clear text.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker needs access to a tech support file generated from a vulnerable Cisco Nexus Dashboard Insights system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to obtain a tech support file from a vulnerable system. This is usually achieved through social engineering or unauthorized access to the system.
