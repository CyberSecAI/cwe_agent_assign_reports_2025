  "description": "A vulnerability in a logging function of Cisco Nexus Dashboard Insights could allow an attacker with access to a tech support file to view sensitive information. This vulnerability exists because remote controller credentials are recorded in an internal log that is stored in the tech support file. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing a tech support file that is generated from an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view remote controller admin credentials in clear text. Note Best practice is to store debug logs and tech support files safely and to share them only with trusted parties because they may contain sensitive information.",

The vulnerability specifically involves logging remote controller admin credentials in clear text within a tech support file. CWE-256 and CWE-522 were considered due to the credentials being stored in plaintext, but the act of inserting it into a log file is the most direct root cause.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe532[\"CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    cwe256[\"CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\"]\n\n    cwe256 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    cwe532 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe532 primary\n    class cwe522,cwe256 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **insertion of sensitive information into a log file (CWE-532)**. This leads to the **plaintext storage of credentials (CWE-256)**, which ultimately results in **exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized actor (CWE-200)**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is primarily based on the provided evidence, specifically the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" and \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" sections. The root cause is explicitly stated as \"remote controller credentials are recorded in an internal log that is stored in the tech support file.\" This aligns directly with the definition of **CWE-532 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File)**. While **CWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password)** and **CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials)** are relevant because the credentials are stored in cleartext, CWE-532 captures the specific action that introduced the vulnerability. The selection of CWE-532 is also supported by its Base abstraction level, which is preferred for mapping root causes.\n\nThe evidence supporting CWE-532 is strong: \"The vulnerability exists because remote controller credentials are recorded in an internal log that is stored in the tech support file.\"\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to
