This vulnerability occurs when an excessively large payload is sent in the board_name field during a PATCH request. By sending a large payload, the UI becomes unresponsive, rendering it impossible for users to interact with or manage the affected board. Additionally, the option to delete the board becomes inaccessible, amplifying the severity of the issue. Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-863 CWE-89 CWE-400 CWE-770 CWE-306 CWE-79 CWE-20 CWE-1333",
