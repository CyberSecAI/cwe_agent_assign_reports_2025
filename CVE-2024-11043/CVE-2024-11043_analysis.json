  "description": "A Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability was discovered in the /api/v1/boards/{board_id} endpoint of invoke-ai/invokeai version v5.0.2. This vulnerability occurs when an excessively large payload is sent in the board_name field during a PATCH request. By sending a large payload, the UI becomes unresponsive, rendering it impossible for users to interact with or manage the affected board. Additionally, the option to delete the board becomes inaccessible, amplifying the severity of the issue.",

CWE-770 is a child of CWE-400, representing a more specific case of resource consumption. While CWE-770 is more specific, the description of the vulnerability does not provide enough detail to definitively choose it over the broader CWE-400.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe400 primary\n    class cwe770 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the receipt of an excessively large payload in the `board_name` field during a PATCH request. This leads to uncontrolled resource consumption, ultimately resulting in a Denial of Service condition where the UI becomes unresponsive.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis indicates that the vulnerability is caused by sending an excessively large payload to the `/api/v1/boards/{board_id}` endpoint, leading to a denial of service. The primary weakness is identified as **CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption)**, which aligns with the description of the UI becoming unresponsive due to the large payload.\n\nThe choice of CWE-400 is based on the vulnerability description, which states that an \"excessively large payload\" causes the UI to become unresponsive. This directly implies that the application is not properly controlling the consumption of resources when processing the request with the large payload. While CWE-400 is a Class-level CWE and thus discouraged, it serves as a better high-level categorization of the vulnerability, given that the evidence does not point to a more specific resource type being exhausted.\n\nCWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) was also considered since it is a child of CWE-400 and more specific. However, the vulnerability description does not explicitly state that the issue is caused by allocating resources without limits, but rather by sending a large payload. Thus, CWE-400 is a more accurate primary classification.\n\nThe evidence for this assessment is based on the following key phrase from the vulnerability description: \"By sending a large payload, the UI becomes unresponsive\".\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-617: Reachable Assertion\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains an assert() or similar statement that can be triggered by an attacker, which leads to an application exit or other behavior that is more severe than necessary.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not selected because there is no indication of an assertion failure leading to the DoS.*\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).

It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports.
