**CVE ID:** CVE-2025-0297
**CVE Description:** PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval

**Content Analysis:**

The provided content contains information about a SQL Injection vulnerability in an "Online Book Shop Using PHP" application. The vulnerability exists in the `/detail.php` file, specifically within the `$id` parameter.

**Extracted Information:**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application queries the `$id` parameter directly into an SQL statement without any sanitization, validation, or restriction.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could gain unauthorized access to the server database and potentially achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE).
*   **Attack vectors:**  The attacker exploits the vulnerability by manipulating the `$id` parameter in the `/detail.php` URL.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to craft malicious SQL queries and send them as the `$id` parameter in a request to the `/detail.php` endpoint. No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Mitigation or fix:** The content does not provide specific mitigation steps, but implies that proper input sanitization and parameterized queries should be implemented to prevent SQL injection.

**Additional Details:**

The gist provides a Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrating how to enumerate databases and potentially gain OS-shell access using `sqlmap`. The PoC includes screenshots of the exploitation process.

**Relevance to CVE:**

The content directly relates to a SQL Injection vulnerability in a PHP application, which is a common type of vulnerability tracked by CVEs. While the CVE description is a placeholder, the details provided in the gist align with the type of vulnerability that would be assigned a CVE.

**More Detail than Official CVE Description:**

Yes, the content provides significantly more detail than a typical CVE description. It includes the specific file and parameter vulnerable, a detailed explanation of the root cause, impact, attack vectors, and a PoC.
