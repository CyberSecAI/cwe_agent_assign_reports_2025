# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2025-30474

## Description

**Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor** vulnerability in Apache Commons VFS. The FtpFileObject class can throw an exception when a file is not found, revealing the original URI in its message, which may include a password. The fix is to mask the password in the exception message This issue affects Apache Commons VFS before 2.10.0. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.10.0, which fixes the issue.

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-209 | Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information | 1.0 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-200 | Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor | 0.7 | Class | Secondary | Discouraged |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-209, which is at the Base level and accurately represents the vulnerability. CWE-200 is a Class-level CWE and is too general. CWE-209 is related to CWE-200 as it can lead to the exposure of sensitive information. The vulnerability chain starts with the generation of an error message containing sensitive information, leading to the exposure of that information to an unauthorized actor.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **improper** generation of an error message that includes sensitive information (CWE-209). This leads to the **exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized actor** (CWE-200).

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis identified CWE-200 as a potential candidate due to the "**Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor**" vulnerability description key phrase. However, based on the detailed analysis of the vulnerability description, the root cause is the generation of an error message containing sensitive information, which is accurately represented by CWE-209.

The vulnerability description states: "The FtpFileObject class can throw an exception when a file is not found, revealing the original URI in its message, which may include a password." This clearly indicates that the error message itself contains the sensitive information. The fix is to mask the password in the exception message, which further supports the selection of CWE-209.

CWE-200 is a more general classification of the impact, while CWE-209 captures the specific root cause. Therefore, CWE-209 is the optimal choice for the primary CWE.

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-378: Creation of Temporary File With Insecure Permissions
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
Opening temporary files without appropriate measures or controls can leave the file, its contents and any function that it impacts vulnerable to attack.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product establishes a communication channel to (or from) an endpoint for privileged or protected operations, but it does not properly ensure that it is communicating with the correct endpoint.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties
**Abstraction Level**: Base
