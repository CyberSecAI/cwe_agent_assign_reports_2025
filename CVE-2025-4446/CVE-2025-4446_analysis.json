The vulnerability description explicitly states a **buffer overflow** due to manipulation of the argument \"param\" in the function \"Edit_List_SSID\".  CWE-120 directly addresses this scenario of copying a buffer without proper size validation, leading to an overflow. |\n| CWE-121 | Stack-based Buffer Overflow | 0.6 | Variant | Allowed | Secondary Candidate. While the description doesn't explicitly mention the stack, it's a common location for buffer overflows, making this a plausible but less certain mapping.  |\n| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 0.5 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate.

The manipulation of the `param` argument directly aligns with the characteristics of CWE-120, which involves copying a buffer without proper size validation.\n\nThe evidence, while clear about the **buffer overflow**, lacks specifics about the memory region involved (stack vs. heap).
