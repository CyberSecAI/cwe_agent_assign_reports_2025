  "reference_content": "- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly escape some of its shortcode settings.\n- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Specifically, the lack of proper escaping of shortcode settings allows for the injection of malicious scripts.\n- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with a Contributor account can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the browsers of other users when they view the affected pages. This could lead to various attacks like session hijacking, credential theft, or defacement.\n- **Attack vectors:** The attacker uses specially crafted shortcodes containing malicious JavaScript code within their attributes.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs at least a Contributor account on the WordPress site to be able to create or modify content containing shortcodes.",
