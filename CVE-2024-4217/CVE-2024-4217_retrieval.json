Specifically, the lack of proper escaping of shortcode settings allows for the injection of malicious scripts.\\n- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with a Contributor account can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the browsers of other users when they view the affected pages. This could lead to various attacks like session hijacking, credential theft, or defacement.\\n- **Attack vectors:** The attacker uses specially crafted shortcodes containing malicious JavaScript code within their attributes.\\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs at least a Contributor account on the WordPress site to be able to create or modify content containing shortcodes.', similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {}, 'top_cwes_by_threshold': {}}}, similarity_summary=SimilarityInsight(consensus_cwe='', top_cwes=[], confidence_levels={}, total_samples=0), analysis='', analysis_with_relationships='', criticism='', resolution='', relevant_cwes=[{'metadata': {'doc_id': '352', 'name': 'Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'weakness:XSS', 'keyphrase': 'XSS', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'weakness:cross-site scripting', 'keyphrase': 'cross-site scripting', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'attacker:attackers with a Contributor account', 'keyphrase': 'attackers with a Contributor account', 'type': 'attacker'}, {'id': 'product:shortcodes-ultimate-pro WordPress plugin', 'keyphrase': 'shortcodes-ultimate-pro WordPress plugin', 'type': 'product'}, {'id': 'version:before 7.1.5', 'keyphrase': 'before 7.1.5', 'type': 'version'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(251.94839621520856)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '116', 'name': 'Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
