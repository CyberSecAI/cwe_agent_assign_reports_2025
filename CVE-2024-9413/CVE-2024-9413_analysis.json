CWE-703 is a high-level Pillar, representing the general error handling issue. While CWE-703 is related, it doesn't provide enough specific information for the vulnerability.\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe120[\"CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')\"]\n    cwe703[\"CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions\"]\n    \n    cwe120 -->|CHILDOF| cwe703\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe120 primary\n    class cwe703 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper handling of errors** and leads to a **buffer overflow**.\n  - **Root Cause:** Improper error handling, specifically when receiving messages from the Application Processor (AP).\n  - **Weakness:** This leads to missing validation or size checks on input data.\n  - **Impact:** The missing checks result in a buffer overflow within the System Control Processor (SCP) firmware.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-120 as the primary weakness due to the explicit mention of a \"buffer overflow\" in the vulnerability description. The **improper handling of errors** is the root cause. The retriever results also highlighted CWE-120 and related buffer overflow CWEs as significant matches. While the \"does not properly handle errors\" phrase is present, the resulting buffer overflow clarifies the specific type of vulnerability.\nThe evidence supporting CWE-120 is the explicit mention of \"buffer overflow\" in the vulnerability description.\nThe retriever results also support this classification, and the relationship analysis confirms that CWE-120 is a specific type of buffer overflow.\nThe choice of CWE-120 is at the optimal level of specificity because it clearly defines the vulnerability mechanism as a buffer copy without checking the size of the input, leading to an overflow.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-696: Incorrect Behavior Order\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs multiple related behaviors, but the behaviors are performed in the wrong order in ways which may produce resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
