CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition (Score: 489.75)\n\nThe product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check. This can cause the product to perform invalid actions when the resource is in an unexpected state....\n\n### 2. CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following') (Score: 431.55)\n\nThe product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource....\n\n### 3. CWE-61: UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following (Score: 407.94)\n\nThe product, when opening a file or directory, does not sufficiently account for when the file is a symbolic link that resolves to a target outside of the intended control sphere. This could allow an attacker to cause the product to operate on unauthorized files....\n\n### 4. CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') (Score: 401.24)\n\nThe product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently....\n\n### 5.
