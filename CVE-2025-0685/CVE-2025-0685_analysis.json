  "description": "A flaw was found in grub2. When reading data from a jfs filesystem, grubs jfs filesystem module uses user-controlled parameters from the filesystem geometry to determine the internal buffer size, however, it **improperly checks for **integer overflows****. A maliciouly crafted filesystem may lead some of those buffer size calculations to overflow, causing it to perform a grub_malloc() operation with a smaller size than expected. As a result, the grub_jfs_lookup_symlink() function will write past the internal buffer length during grub_jfs_read_file(). This issue can be leveraged to corrupt grubs internal critical data and may result in arbitrary code execution, by-passing secure boot protections.",

It's a Red Hat Bugzilla report specifically referencing the CVE. Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information extracted:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\n*   Integer overflow when handling symlinks in the JFS filesystem module within GRUB2. The module uses user-controlled parameters from the filesystem geometry to determine buffer sizes without proper overflow checks.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Integer overflow\n*   Heap-based out-of-bounds write\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   Corruption of GRUB's internal critical data.\n*   Potential for arbitrary code execution, bypassing secure boot protections.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Maliciously crafted JFS filesystem.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   Ability to create or modify a JFS filesystem that is accessible during the GRUB boot process.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   The bug report does not specify a fix or mitigation.\n\n**Additional Details (more detail than official CVE description):**\n\n*   The vulnerability occurs during the `grub_jfs_lookup_symlink()` function, which writes past the internal buffer length during `grub_jfs_read_file()` due to the overflow.\n*   The vulnerability is related to how GRUB calculates buffer sizes based on filesystem geometry.\n*   The bug was reported by OSIDB Bzimport on February 17, 2025.\n*   Priority is medium and Severity is medium.\n*   The bug is assigned to the \"Product Security DevOps Team\".",

The **CWE-190** is a root cause that **CanPrecede** **CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer**, which then leads to a heap-based buffer overflow. Therefore, **CWE-122** is a more specific variant.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe190[\"CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe122[\"CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    \n    cwe190 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe119\n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe190 primary\n    class cwe122 secondary\n    class cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **improper check for integer overflows (CWE-190)** when calculating buffer sizes based on user-controlled parameters from the filesystem geometry. This leads to a smaller-than-expected buffer allocation, ultimately resulting in a **heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122)** when the `grub_jfs_lookup_symlink()` function writes past the allocated buffer during `grub_jfs_read_file()`.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, which clearly states that the vulnerability stems from **improper checks for integer overflows** in grub2's jfs filesystem module. This **improper check for integer overflows** results in a heap-based buffer overflow. The retriever results also strongly suggest **CWE-190 Integer Overflow or Wraparound** as a potential match. The vulnerability description specifically mentions that the **improper checks for integer overflows** leads to the `grub_malloc()` operation allocating a smaller size than expected. The graph relationships show that **CWE-190 Integer Overflow or Wraparound** can precede **CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer**, and **CWE-122 Heap-based Buffer Overflow** is a child of **CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer**, confirming the chain of events.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because **CWE-190** directly addresses the **improper check for integer overflows**, which is the root cause, and **CWE-122** represents the specific type of buffer overflow (heap-based) that occurs.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1285: Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input that is expected to specify an index, position, or offset into an indexable resource such as a buffer or file, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the specified index/position/offset has the required properties.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs a calculation that can\n         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic\n         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than\n         the original value.
