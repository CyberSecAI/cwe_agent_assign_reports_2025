  "method": "sparse_weakness_1",
  "query": "A flaw was found in grub2. When reading data from a jfs filesystem, grubs jfs filesystem module uses user-controlled parameters from the filesystem geometry to determine the internal buffer size, however, it improperly checks for integer overflows. A maliciouly crafted filesystem may lead some of those buffer size calculations to overflow, causing it to perform a grub_malloc() operation with a smaller size than expected. As a result, the grub_jfs_lookup_symlink() function will write past the internal buffer length during grub_jfs_read_file(). This issue can be leveraged to corrupt grubs internal critical data and may result in arbitrary code execution, by-passing secure boot protections.",
