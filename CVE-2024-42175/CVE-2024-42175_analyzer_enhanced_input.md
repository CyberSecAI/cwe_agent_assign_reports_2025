    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'input validation vulnerability'

Relevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:

### 1. CWE-20: Improper Input Validation (Score: 240.10)

        not validate or incorrectly validates that the input has the
        properties that are required to process the data safely and
        correctly....

### 2. CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input (Score: 240.09)
