A vulnerability present starting in version 3.0.5 up to and including version 4.6.3 allows an attacker to impersonate any user during SAML authentication by crafting a SAMLResponse. This can be done by using a valid SAML object that was signed by the configured IdP. Users are affected specifically when the service provider is using passport-wsfed-saml2 and a valid SAML document signed by the Identity Provider can be obtained. Version 4.6.4 contains a fix for the vulnerability. Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-1270 CWE-1390 CWE-384 CWE-488 CWE-287 CWE-308 CWE-613 CWE-611 CWE-347",
