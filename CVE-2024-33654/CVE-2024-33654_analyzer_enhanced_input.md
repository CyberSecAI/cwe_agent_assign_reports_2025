The vulnerability is due to an out-of-bounds read occurring while parsing specially crafted BMP files. Specifically, the application attempts to read data beyond the boundaries of an allocated structure.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds read (CWE-125)

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the current process, potentially allowing the attacker to gain control of the application and the system it's running on.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves the user opening a maliciously crafted BMP file using the vulnerable Simcenter Femap application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to create a malicious BMP file.
- The attacker needs to trick the user into opening the crafted file with the vulnerable application.
- The attacker does not need any privileges to perform the attack.
- The attacker needs to have local access.
