# Raw Analyzer Response for CVE-2024-47002

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-79 | Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE. The vulnerability is due to **improper neutralization of input** during web page generation. |
| CWE-80 | Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS) | 0.7 | Variant | Allowed | Secondary CWE. This is a more specific variant of XSS related to script-related HTML tags. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-79, which is a base-level CWE. CWE-80 is a variant of CWE-79, representing a more specific type of Cross-site Scripting. The selection of CWE-79 as primary is based on its direct match to the vulnerability description, while CWE-80 is considered due to the mention of HTML code injection, suggesting script-related tags are involved.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **improper neutralization of input**, leading to the injection of arbitrary HTML code, which results in Cross-Site Scripting.
  - Root Cause: **Improper Neutralization of Input** (CWE-79)
  - Impact: Execution of malicious scripts, information stealing, defacement, redirection.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment, based on the vulnerability description and key phrases, strongly suggests CWE-79 as the primary weakness. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" confirms this, explicitly stating that the vulnerability is due to **improper neutralization of input** during web page generation and identifying CWE-79 as a present weakness. The provided example URL `http://192.168.0.40/vlan/?vlan_id=<LINK REL="stylesheet" HREF="http://192.168.0.140:8000/very_evil.css">` further supports this, as it shows the injection of HTML code through the `vlan_id` parameter.

CWE-80 is considered as a secondary CWE because the injected code example uses a `<LINK>` tag, which is related to script-related HTML tags, making CWE-80 a relevant, more specific variant of XSS.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-79 representing the general XSS vulnerability and CWE-80 representing a more specific case involving script-related HTML tags.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as "<", ">", and "&" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.



## CWE-204: Observable Response Discrepancy
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product provides different responses to incoming requests in a way that reveals internal state information to an unauthorized actor outside of the intended control sphere.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-93: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses CRLF (carriage return line feeds) as a special element, e.g. to separate lines or records, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CRLF sequences from inputs.

**Mapping Guidance**:
