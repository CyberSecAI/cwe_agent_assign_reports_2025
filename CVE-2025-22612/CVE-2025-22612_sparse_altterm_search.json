Prior to version 4.0.0-beta.374, the missing authorization allows an authenticated user to retrieve any existing private keys on a coolify instance in plain text. If the server configuration of IP / domain, port (most likely 22) and user (root) matches with the victims server configuration, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the remote server. Version 4.0.0-beta.374 fixes the issue.",
