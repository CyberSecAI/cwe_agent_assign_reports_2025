The retriever results suggested other CWEs, including those related to authorization and file uploads. However, the vulnerability description explicitly states that the issue is about **Sensitive Information Exposure** via the attachments.php file, making CWE-200 the most relevant.

The description mentions \"unauthenticated attackers\" being able to \"extract sensitive data,\" supporting the selection of CWE-200 [Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor].\n\nThe retriever suggested a number of possible CWEs including:\n*   CWE-352 [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)] - This is not relevant because the vulnerability description focuses on sensitive information exposure and unauthorized access to files, not CSRF attacks.\n*   CWE-434 [Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type] - While file uploads are involved, the core issue is not the unrestricted upload of dangerous file types, but rather the exposure of uploaded files to unauthorized users.\n*   CWE-306 [Missing Authentication for Critical Function] - Authentication is a potential contributing factor but the high level effect is **sensitive information exposure**.\n*   CWE-862 [Missing Authorization] and CWE-425 [Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')] - These are related to authorization issues, which may be a contributing factor to the vulnerability. However, the direct result is the **exposure of sensitive information**, making CWE-200 a more direct fit.\n*   CWE-359 [Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor] - This is a more specific type of information exposure. But the **Vulnerability Description** only talks about **Sensitive Information Exposure** and doesn't specify that it's personal.\n\nThe graph relationships also influenced the decision, as they highlight the potential connection between authorization-related CWEs and information exposure.
