  "description": "**Absolute path traversal** (incorrect restriction of a path to a restricted directory) vulnerability in the EasyPHP web server, affecting version 14.1. This vulnerability could allow remote users to bypass SecurityManager restrictions and retrieve any file stored on the server by setting only consecutive strings /...%5c.",

  },
  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is an absolute path traversal issue due to \"incorrect restriction of a path to a restricted directory\" within the EasyPHP web server.\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary weakness is a CWE-22 vulnerability, which means improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory. This allows an attacker to traverse directories outside the intended web root.\n*   **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows remote users to bypass `SecurityManager` restrictions and retrieve any file stored on the server. It's a confidentiality issue as attackers can access sensitive files.\n*   **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based (AV:N). The vulnerability is triggered by sending crafted requests containing consecutive strings `/...%5c`. This appears to bypass the intended path restrictions.\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have low privileges (PR:L), and no user interaction is required (UI:N).\n\n**Additional details not explicitly in the CVE description:**\n\n*   The specific method of exploitation involves using `/...%5c` sequences in the request to bypass the `SecurityManager`.\n*   The affected version is EasyPHP web server version 14.1\n*   The CVSS score is 6.5 with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N, highlighting the high confidentiality impact.\n*   There is no known solution or patch available at this time.\n\nThis information is more detailed than the placeholder CVE description and provides specific details about the vulnerability.",

CWE-36, Absolute Path Traversal, is a child of CWE-22 and represents a specific type of path traversal. The relationship analysis confirms that the vulnerability described aligns with CWE-22 due to the **incorrect restriction** of a path. Since the vulnerability is specifically an **absolute path traversal**, CWE-36 is also considered as a secondary candidate.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\"]\n    cwe36[\"CWE-36: Absolute Path Traversal\"]\n    \n    cwe36 -->|CHILDOF| cwe22\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe22 primary\n    class cwe36 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper limitation** of a pathname, leading to path traversal, and ultimately allowing remote users to bypass security restrictions and retrieve arbitrary files.\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\n2.  **Impact:** Bypass SecurityManager restrictions and retrieve any file stored on the server.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, which includes the vulnerability description and the CVE reference content summary. The vulnerability is clearly described as an **absolute path traversal** issue due to the **incorrect restriction** of a path. This directly aligns with CWE-22.\n\nThe relationship analysis between CWE-22 and CWE-36 influenced the selection. While CWE-36 is a more specific type of path traversal, CWE-22 represents the root cause of the vulnerability which is the **improper limitation** of the path.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-22 captures the fundamental flaw, while CWE-36 identifies the specific type of path traversal.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-24: Path Traversal: '../filedir'\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize \"../\" sequences that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-36: Absolute Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize absolute path sequences such as \"/abs/path\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
