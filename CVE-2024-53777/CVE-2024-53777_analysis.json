The specific impact can vary depending on the actions available in the vulnerable plugin.\n- **Attack vectors**: An attacker would need to trick an authenticated user into clicking a malicious link or loading a malicious page that makes a request to the vulnerable plugin. This can be achieved via social engineering, phishing, or other methods of inducing a user to trigger the request.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious request. They do not require any prior authentication with the target system or plugin itself, only that they are able to successfully induce a logged-in user to trigger the forged request.",

The secondary weakness is **CWE-79**, Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting'), which results from the lack of CSRF protection and enables stored XSS. There is a potential chain where **CWE-352** can lead to **CWE-79** if the forged request injects malicious script into the web page.
