CWE-259 is a more specific variant of CWE-798. Since the vulnerability specifically mentions a \"hardcoded password,\" using CWE-259 is more accurate than using its parent, CWE-798, which covers a broader range of credentials.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe259[\"CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password\"]\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    cwe259 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe259 primary\n    class cwe798 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is simple:\n1.  **Root Cause:** CWE-259 (Use of Hard-coded Password) - The device ships with a **hardcoded password** in the /etc/shadow file.\n2.  **Impact:** Attackers can log in as root, gaining full control of the device.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that there is a **hardcoded password** in the /etc/shadow file. This directly corresponds to CWE-259 (Use of Hard-coded Password), which is a variant-level CWE. The retriever results also list CWE-259 as the top candidate. Given the clear evidence and the guidance to prefer more specific CWEs when available, CWE-259 is the most appropriate choice.\n\nThe evidence for this decision is: \"COMFAST CF-WR630AX v2.7.0.2 was discovered to contain a **hardcoded password** vulnerability in /etc/shadow, which allows attackers to log in as root.\"\n\nCWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials) was considered, but it's a more general case. Since the vulnerability specifically mentions a password, CWE-259 is more accurate. Other CWEs like CWE-425 (Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')) and CWE-471 (Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID)) are not relevant to this vulnerability.\n\n# Relevant CWE Information:\n\n#
