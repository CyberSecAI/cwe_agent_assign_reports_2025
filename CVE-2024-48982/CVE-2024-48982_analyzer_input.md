# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-48982

# Vulnerability Description

    An issue was discovered in MBed OS 6.16.0. Its hci parsing software dynamically determines the length of certain hci packets by reading a byte from its header. This value is assumed to be greater than or equal to 3, but the software doesnt ensure that this is the case. Supplying a length less than 3 leads to a **buffer overflow** in a buffer that is allocated later. It is simultaneously possible to cause another **integer overflow** by supplying large length values because the provided length value is increased by a few bytes to account for additional information that is supposed to be stored there. This bug is trivial to exploit for a denial of service but is not certain to suffice to bring the system down and can generally not be exploited further because the exploitable buffer is dynamically allocated.

    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'doesnt ensure the length of certain hci packets is greater than or equal to 3'

Relevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:

### 1. CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input (Score: 1120.52)

The product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties....

### 2. CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value (Score: 1064.45)

The product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated....

### 3. CWE-130: Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency (Score: 1051.82)

The product parses a formatted message or structure, but it does not handle or incorrectly handles a length field that is inconsistent with the actual length of the associated data....

### 4. CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound (Score: 1049.53)

The product performs a calculation that can
         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic
         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than
         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is
         incremented to a value that is too large to st...

### 5. CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound) (Score: 1047.37)

The product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result....
