  "description": "An issue was discovered in MBed OS 6.16.0. Its hci parsing software dynamically determines the length of certain hci packets by reading a byte from its header. This value is assumed to be greater than or equal to 3, but the software doesnt ensure that this is the case. Supplying a length less than 3 leads to a **buffer overflow** in a buffer that is allocated later. It is simultaneously possible to cause another **integer overflow** by supplying large length values because the provided length value is increased by a few bytes to account for additional information that is supposed to be stored there. This bug is trivial to exploit for a denial of service but is not certain to suffice to bring the system down and can generally not be exploited further because the exploitable buffer is dynamically allocated.",

  "reference_content": "The provided content relates to CVE-2024-48982.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nInteger overflows in `hciEvtProcessCmdCmpl` when calculating the size of the buffer to allocate for an incoming HCI command packet.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**\n1.  **Integer Underflow:** When the length of the packet body (`len`) is less than 3, subtracting 3 from it results in an underflow when `remainingLen` is calculated as `len - 3`. This leads to a very large value for `remainingLen` when it is stored as an 8-bit integer.\n2.  **Integer Overflow:**  The size of the message buffer (`msgSize`) is calculated by adding `remainingLen` to the size of a structure (`structSize`), both stored as 8-bit integers. When the sum exceeds the maximum value of a `uint8_t`, it results in a small `msgSize`, while the `memcpy` copies `remainingLen` bytes to this buffer, causing a buffer overflow.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\nA buffer overflow occurs when `memcpy` copies data into the allocated buffer. This can lead to memory corruption, potentially allowing an attacker to overwrite adjacent memory regions and execute arbitrary code.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\nAn attacker can craft a malicious HCI command packet with a carefully chosen length field.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\nThe attacker needs to be able to send malicious HCI command packets to the vulnerable system.",
