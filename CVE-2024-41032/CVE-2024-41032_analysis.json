  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved mm vmalloc check if a hash-index is in cpu_possible_mask The problem is that there are systems where cpu_possible_mask has gaps between set CPUs, for example SPARC. In this scenario addr_to_vb_xa() hash function can return an index which accesses to not-possible and not setup CPU area using per_cpu() macro. This results in an oops on SPARC. A per-cpu vmap_block_queue is also used as hash table, incorrectly assuming the cpu_possible_mask has no gaps. Fix it by adjusting an index to a next possible CPU.",

  "reference_content": "The provided content relates to a vulnerability in the Linux kernel's vmalloc subsystem, specifically how it handles CPU masks when calculating hash indexes for per-CPU data.\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\nThe root cause is an incorrect assumption in the `addr_to_vb_xa()` hash function. It uses `num_possible_cpus()` to calculate the hash index, which doesn't account for systems where `cpu_possible_mask` has gaps between set CPUs (e.g., SPARC). This can result in an index that points to a non-existent CPU area when using the `per_cpu()` macro, causing a kernel oops. The per-cpu `vmap_block_queue` is also incorrectly used as a hash table, assuming no gaps in the `cpu_possible_mask`.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Incorrect Hash Index Calculation:** The hash function does not properly check if the calculated index is within the range of actually available CPUs as indicated by `cpu_possible_mask`.\n*   **Use of `num_possible_cpus()`:** The use of `num_possible_cpus()` is inadequate, as it may include CPUs that are not online or that are not part of the active set.\n*   **Incorrect Assumption about cpu_possible_mask:** The code assumes that the `cpu_possible_mask` has no gaps, which is not always the case in certain architectures like SPARC.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Kernel Oops:** Exploiting this vulnerability leads to a kernel oops (a type of kernel panic). This will result in a denial of service because the system will likely crash or become unstable.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   The vulnerability is triggered by the `addr_to_vb_xa()` function, which is part of the vmalloc subsystem. It's triggered when the system allocates memory using vmalloc.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   An attacker needs to be able to trigger vmalloc allocations, which is commonly done through normal system operations.\n*   The attacker doesn't need special privileges beyond the ability to allocate memory.\n*   This is a local vulnerability meaning the attacker must have the ability to execute code on the system.\n\n**Fix:**\nThe fix replaces the use of `num_possible_cpus()` with `nr_cpu_ids` and checks if the index is valid using `cpu_possible(index)`. If not, it adjusts the index to the next possible CPU using `cpumask_next(index, cpu_possible_mask)`. This ensures the index is always valid for systems with gapped CPU masks, thereby avoiding the oops.",

CWE-129 is a more specific variant of this, focusing on array indexes. The code's **incorrect assumption about the `cpu_possible_mask`** leads to the use of an invalid index, which then results in a kernel oops. The relationship between CWE-1285 and CWE-129 is a parent-child relationship where CWE-129 is a variant of CWE-1285.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1285[\"CWE-1285: Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input\"]\n    cwe129[\"CWE-129: Improper Validation of Array Index\"]\n    \n    cwe129 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1285\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe1285 primary\n    class cwe129 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **incorrect assumption** about `cpu_possible_mask` which leads to **improper calculation of hash index**, then to **improper validation of the index** resulting in access to an invalid memory location, and finally to a kernel oops.\n\n`Incorrect Assumption` -> `Improper Calculation` -> `Improper Validation (CWE-1285)` -> `Kernel Oops`\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe primary assessment is that the vulnerability is due to an **improper validation of the index**, leading to an out-of-bounds access. The evidence includes the vulnerability description stating that the `addr_to_vb_xa()` hash function can return an index which accesses a non-possible and not setup CPU area, and the fix involves adjusting the index to the next possible CPU if it's not valid. This directly aligns with CWE-1285, which describes the **improper validation of specified index, position, or offset in input**.\n\nThe retriever results suggest several potential CWEs, including CWE-407 (Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity), CWE-362 (Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization), and CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference). However, these do not directly address the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **improper validation of the calculated index**.\n\nCWE-1285 is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level. CWE-129 is more specific variant. I have included both to capture the essence of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this
