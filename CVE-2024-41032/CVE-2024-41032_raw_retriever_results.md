# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-41032
## Query
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved mm vmalloc check if a hash-index is in cpu_possible_mask The problem is that there are systems where cpu_possible_mask has gaps between set CPUs, for example SPARC. In this scenario addr_to_vb_xa() hash function can return an index which accesses to not-possible and not setup CPU area using per_cpu() macro. This results in an oops on SPARC. A per-cpu vmap_block_queue is also used as hash table, incorrectly assuming the cpu_possible_mask has no gaps. Fix it by adjusting an index to a next possible CPU.

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: 'incorrect assumption about cpu_possible_mask'
