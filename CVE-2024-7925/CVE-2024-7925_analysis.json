  "description": "A vulnerability was found in ZZCMS 2023. It has been rated as problematic. This issue affects some unknown processing of the file 3/E_bak5.1/upload/eginfo.php. The manipulation of the argument phome with the input ShowPHPInfo leads to information disclosure. The attack may be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability stems from the inclusion of the `phpinfo()` function in the `eginfo.php` file within the ZZCMS 2023 software.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- **Information Disclosure:** The primary weakness is the presence of the `phpinfo()` function, which, when executed, outputs a large amount of sensitive system and PHP configuration information.\n- **Lack of Access Control:** The vulnerability is triggered when accessing `/3/E_bak5.1/upload/eginfo.php` with the `phome=ShowPHPInfo` parameter via a GET request. It appears that the access is only restricted by requiring a user to be logged in, which is insufficient to prevent this type of information disclosure.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- **Sensitive Information Exposure:** The `phpinfo()` output reveals crucial details, including server paths, PHP version, loaded extensions, environment variables, and potentially database credentials and other sensitive data. This information can be used to gain a deeper understanding of the system and its configuration, which can be leveraged for further attacks.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- **HTTP GET request:** The attacker can trigger the vulnerability using a simple HTTP GET request to the vulnerable URL: `/3/E_bak5.1/upload/eginfo.php?phome=ShowPHPInfo`\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be logged into the ZZCMS application to exploit the vulnerability.\n- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable ZZCMS installation.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n- The vulnerability affects ZZCMS version 2023.\n- The vulnerable file is located at `/3/E_bak5.1/upload/eginfo.php`\n- The vulnerability is triggered by passing `phome=ShowPHPInfo` as a GET parameter.\n- The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability using the specified URL and parameter.",

It does not have any specific child CWEs that would be more appropriate. The secondary CWE, CWE-425 [Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')], is also a base-level CWE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe497[\"CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\"]\n    cwe425[\"CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\"]\n    cwe288[\"CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel\"]\n    cwe425 -- CHILDOF --> cwe288\n    \n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe497 primary\n    class cwe425 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **lack of proper access control** (potentially CWE-425, Direct Request), leading to the execution of `eginfo.php` with the `phome=ShowPHPInfo` parameter. This then leads to **information disclosure** (CWE-497) due to the presence and execution of the `phpinfo()` function, which outputs sensitive system and PHP configuration information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary assessment is based on the evidence from the provided vulnerability description and CVE reference links content summary. The vulnerability involves the **exposure of sensitive information** due to the presence of the `phpinfo()` function in the `eginfo.php` file, which can be accessed via a direct request.\n\nThe evidence is strong: \"The vulnerability stems from the inclusion of the `phpinfo()` function in the `eginfo.php` file within the ZZCMS 2023 software.\" The impact of exploitation is \"Sensitive Information Exposure: The `phpinfo()` output reveals crucial details, including server paths, PHP version, loaded extensions, environment variables, and potentially database credentials and other sensitive data.\"\n\nCWE-497 [Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere] is the most appropriate primary CWE as it directly addresses the **exposure of sensitive system-level information**.
