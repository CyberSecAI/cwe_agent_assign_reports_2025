## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content is related to CVE-2024-11661.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input validation and sanitization in the `profile.php` file of the "Free Exam Hall Seating Management System In PHP with Source Code" application. Specifically, the file upload functionality, which uses the `$_FILES` variable, directly uses the user-provided input to determine the storage location of the uploaded file without any checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Unrestricted file upload: The application does not validate the type or content of the uploaded file.
- Lack of input sanitization: The application does not clean user input before using it to determine the file storage location.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- File overwrite: An attacker can overwrite existing files.
- File injection: An attacker can upload malicious files, like PHP scripts.
- Directory traversal: An attacker might be able to upload files to arbitrary locations on the server.
- Denial of service (DoS): An attacker can upload large files to consume storage and resources.
- Remote code execution (RCE): By uploading and executing malicious PHP files, an attacker can achieve RCE.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote attacker: A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by uploading a crafted file via the `profile.php` file upload functionality.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to access and interact with the file upload functionality of the vulnerable application.
-  Ability to craft malicious payloads, like PHP scripts to upload.
