| CWE-639 | Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key | 0.7 | Base | Secondary Candidate | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that impacts the decision is that CWE-862 [CWE-862: Missing Authorization] is a class-level CWE, and it has child CWEs that are more specific, but the provided evidence doesn't strongly point to a specific child. However, CWE-639 [CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key] which is a base CWE, is considered as a secondary candidate, providing more specific information regarding the vulnerability. Since the vulnerability involves missing authorization checks, it can lead to authorization bypass.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **missing authorization** checks, which leads to users being able to access resources (course badges) they are not intended to access.

## Summary of Analysis
The vulnerability is due to **insufficient access control** when fetching lists of course badges. The root cause is a **missing authorization** check that would ensure users can only access badges for courses they are enrolled in. The description states, "Additional checks are required to ensure users can only fetch the list of course badges for courses that they are intended to have access to." This directly implies a **lack of authorization** checks, making CWE-862 [CWE-862: Missing Authorization] the most appropriate primary CWE.

CWE-639 [CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key] is considered as a secondary candidate because the vulnerability description suggests that users can modify the key value to access other user's data.

The final selection is based on the evidence provided, particularly the phrases highlighting the **missing authorization** checks. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity given the available information.

- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information
