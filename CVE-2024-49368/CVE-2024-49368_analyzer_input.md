# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-49368

## Vulnerability Description
Nginx UI is a web user interface for the Nginx web server. Prior to version 2.0.0-beta.36, when Nginx UI configures logrotate, it does not verify the input and directly passes it to exec.Command, causing arbitrary command execution. Version 2.0.0-beta.36 fixes this issue.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **improper input validation**
- **impact:** arbitrary command execution
- **product:** Nginx UI
- **version:** prior to 2.0.0-beta.36

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-49368:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of input sanitization when configuring logrotate settings in nginx-ui. The `logrotate.cmd` command, which is obtained from the settings, is directly passed to `exec.Command` without proper validation or sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** The primary weakness is the ability to execute arbitrary commands on the server by manipulating the `logrotate.cmd` setting.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize user-provided input before using it in a system command, leading to the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Command Execution (RCE):** An attacker can achieve remote command execution on the server running nginx-ui by setting a malicious command in the logrotate settings.
- **Complete System Compromise:** Successful exploitation could lead to complete compromise of the server, allowing the attacker to perform various malicious activities, including data theft, malware installation, and denial of service attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector involves sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/api/settings` endpoint with a malicious `logrotate.cmd` value.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the ability to modify settings within the nginx-ui application.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the nginx-ui application's API endpoint.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in versions of nginx-ui up to and including v2.0.0-beta.35.
- The patched version is v2.0.0-beta.36, which presumably includes a fix to sanitize the `logrotate.cmd` input.
- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates how to exploit the vulnerability by sending a specific JSON payload to the `/api/settings` endpoint. This payload contains the malicious command `touch /tmp/deadbeef` as a value for `logrotate.cmd` which, when executed, will create a file named "deadbeef" in the /tmp directory.
