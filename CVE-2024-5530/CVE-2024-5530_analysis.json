  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-5530\n\n**Description:** The vulnerability is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) flaw found in the \"ShopLentor \u2013 WooCommerce Builder for Elementor & Gutenberg +12 Modules \u2013 All in One Solution (formerly WooLentor)\" WordPress plugin, specifically affecting versions 2.9.0 and earlier.\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n- Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes within the plugin's \"WL: Product Horizontal Filter\" widget.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-provided data when configuring the \"WL: Product Horizontal Filter\" widget. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that is stored in the database and executed when a user views the affected page.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Arbitrary Web Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser when they access a page containing the vulnerable widget.\n- **Potential for Malicious Actions:** This can lead to various malicious activities, including but not limited to:\n    - Stealing user session cookies.\n    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.\n    - Defacing websites.\n    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Plugin Widget Configuration:**  The attacker injects malicious code into the settings of the \"WL: Product Horizontal Filter\" widget through the WordPress admin interface.\n- **User Interaction:** No direct user interaction is required to trigger the exploit. The malicious script executes when the page containing the widget is viewed.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have at least \"Contributor\" level access to the WordPress admin panel to configure the plugin widget.\n- **Access to WordPress Admin Panel:** The attacker needs to be able to access and modify settings in the WordPress admin interface.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n- The vulnerability was publicly published on June 10, 2024.\n- The vulnerable code can be found in the file `wl_product_horizontal_filter.php` within the plugin.\n- The vulnerability was patched in version 2.9.1 of the plugin.\n- The fix involves sanitizing the input for the price range in the horizontal filter.",

The root cause is explicitly stated as **insufficient input sanitization and output escaping**, which directly maps to CWE-79. The description also explicitly mentions \"Cross-Site Scripting,\" further supporting this classification.\n\nThe retriever results also showed the highest score for CWE-79.\n\nThe selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity, as the description does not provide enough detail to warrant a more specific variant of CWE-79.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.\n\n*Not Used:* CSRF is not directly related to the described vulnerability, which focuses on XSS due to **insufficient input sanitization and output escaping**.\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Used:* While related to XSS, CWE-80 is more specific to HTML tag neutralization, and the description doesn't provide sufficient detail to differentiate it from the broader CWE-79.\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Used:* Missing authorization is not mentioned in the vulnerability description.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not Used:* CWE-116 is a class-level CWE. The vulnerability description is more accurately and directly described by CWE-79.\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Used:* This is not related to the vulnerability described.\n\n## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Used:* Unrestricted file upload is not related to the vulnerability described.\n\n## CWE-96: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Statically Saved Code ('Static Code Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes code syntax before inserting the input into an executable resource, such as a library, configuration file, or template.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Used:* Static code injection is not explicitly mentioned or implied in the provided vulnerability description. The focus is on the lack of sanitization and escaping leading to XSS.\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Used:* There is no information about an incomplete list of disallowed inputs.\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not Used:* CWE-138 is too general.

The description also explicitly mentions \"Cross-Site Scripting,\" further supporting this classification.\n\nThe retriever results also showed the highest score for CWE-79.\n\nThe selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity, as the description does not provide enough detail to warrant a more specific variant of CWE-79.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.\n\n*Not Used:* CSRF is not directly related to the described vulnerability, which focuses on XSS due to **insufficient input sanitization and output escaping**.\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Used:* While related to XSS, CWE-80 is more specific to HTML tag neutralization, and the description doesn't provide sufficient detail to differentiate it from the broader CWE-79.\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Used:* Missing authorization is not mentioned in the vulnerability description.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not Used:* CWE-116 is a class-level CWE. The vulnerability description is more accurately and directly described by CWE-79.\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Used:* This is not related to the vulnerability described.\n\n## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Used:* Unrestricted file upload is not related to the vulnerability described.\n\n## CWE-96: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Statically Saved Code ('Static Code Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes code syntax before inserting the input into an executable resource, such as a library, configuration file, or template.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Used:* Static code injection is not explicitly mentioned or implied in the provided vulnerability description. The focus is on the lack of sanitization and escaping leading to XSS.\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Used:* There is no information about an incomplete list of disallowed inputs.\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not Used:* CWE-138 is too general. CWE-79 is more specific and appropriate.\n\n## CWE-862: Missing Authorization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 1114.96\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not Used:* The vulnerability description states that the attacker has contributor-level access or above, implying that authorization exists, but the problem is the **insufficient input sanitization and output escaping**.\n\n## CWE-494: Download of Code Without Integrity Check\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 4.33\n**Source**: graph\n\n**Description**:\nCWE-494: Download of Code Without Integrity Check\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Used:* Code downloads are not related to this vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 3.23\n**Source**: graph\n\n**Description**:\nCWE\n\n\n## CWE Relationship Analysis\n\nCurrent CWEs represent these abstraction levels: .\n\n\n### Vulnerability Chain Analysis\n\n**Chain starting from CWE-116:**\n- 116 (Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output) - ROOT\n\n\n**Chain starting from CWE-494:**\n- 494 (Download of Code Without Integrity Check) - ROOT\n\n\n\n### CWE Relationship Diagram\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n```",
