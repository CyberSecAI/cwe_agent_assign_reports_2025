While it's generally discouraged to map to class-level CWEs, the vulnerability description explicitly mentions **\"Improper Input Validation vulnerability\"** as the root cause.\nCWE-20 has child relationships with more specific input validation CWEs like CWE-1284.\nCWE-787 and CWE-1284 are considered because they are frequently associated with input validation issues, where **improper input validation** can lead to out-of-bounds writes or incorrect quantity specifications.\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe1284[\"CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\"]\n\n    cwe1284 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    cwe787 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe20\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe20 primary\n    class cwe787,cwe1284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper input validation** (CWE-20). This can potentially lead to an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787) if the size or length of the input is not properly validated (CWE-1284). The ultimate impact is a denial-of-service condition.\n\nCWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) -> CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input) -> CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) -> Denial of Service\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description, which explicitly states that the vulnerability is due to **\"Improper Input Validation vulnerability\"**. While CWE-20 is a class-level CWE and discouraged, its direct mention in the vulnerability description justifies its selection as the primary CWE. The other CWEs, like CWE-787 and CWE-1284, are potential consequences of this **improper input validation**.\n\nRelevant evidence: \"InDesign Desktop versions ID20.0, ID19.5.1 and earlier are affected by an Improper **Input Validation vulnerability** that could result in an application denial-of-service condition.\"\n\nCWE-20 is at the optimal level of specificity because the vulnerability description does not provide enough details to pinpoint a more specific input validation issue.\nCWE-787 is included as a possible consequence.\nCWE-1284 is included as a possible cause of the out-of-bounds write if a quantity is not validated.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-657: Violation of Secure Design Principles\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product violates well-established principles for secure design.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
