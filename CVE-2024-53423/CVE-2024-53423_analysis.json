The gist file `gistfile1.txt` contains a description of the vulnerability. Here's the extracted information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nSupplying crafted packets.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\nUncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400).\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\nDenial of Service (DoS).\n\n**Attack vectors:**\nFlood malicious IPv4 packets that are not filtered by the P4 program (basic.p4 or fabric.p4), but fail in deserialization in ONOS core, preventing applications from receiving other packets to register hosts and links.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\nRemote.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\nNot specified in the provided content.\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   **Affected Product:** Open Network Foundation ONOS v2.7.0\n*   **Affected Components:**\n    *   `resources/basic.p4`\n    *   `java/org/onosproject/pipelines/basic/BasicInterpreterImpl.java` in `pipelines/basic/src/main`\n    *   `resources/fabric.p4`\n    *   `java/org/onosproject/pipelines/fabric/impl/behaviour/FabricInterpreter.java` in `pipelines/fabric/impl/src/main`\n*   **Reference Links:**\n    *   [https://wiki.onosproject.org/display/ONOS/Provider+Tutorial](https://wiki.onosproject.org/display/ONOS/Provider+Tutorial)\n    *   [https://wiki.onosproject.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=16122675](https://wiki.onosproject.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=16122675)\n*   **Discoverer:** Jiwon Kim\n\nThe second content source (wiki.onosproject.org) provides related tutorials but does not contain information about the vulnerability itself.
