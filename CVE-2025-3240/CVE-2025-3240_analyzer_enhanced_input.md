## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-3240 Content

Based on the provided content, this relates to a SQL injection vulnerability in Phpgurukul Online Fire Reporting System Project V1.2. The CVE description is missing, but the content provides more detail than a standard CVE description would.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   A SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `/admin/search.php` file due to insufficient user input validation of the `searchdata` parameter. Malicious code injected through this parameter is directly used in SQL queries without proper cleaning or validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   SQL Injection

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Unauthorized database access
*   Sensitive data leakage
*   Data tampering
*   System control
*   Service interruption

**Attack vectors:**

*   The `/admin/search.php` file is vulnerable via the `searchdata` POST parameter.
*   No login or authorization is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to send a POST request to `/admin/search.php` with a crafted `searchdata` parameter. No authentication is required.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   Use prepared statements and parameter binding.
*   Implement strict input validation and filtering.
*   Minimize database user permissions.
*   Conduct regular security audits.

**Payload Examples:**

*   Time-based blind injection: `searchdata=1' AND (SELECT 8405 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))ACTc) AND 'JeYp'='JeYp&search=`
*   UNION query: `searchdata=1' UNION ALL SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,CONCAT(0x716a7a6b71,0x46626a724f6f6261707754646b7878414d59635048664351684f6278434464616e73476a77575752,0x716b707a71),NULL,NULL,NULL-- -&search=`
