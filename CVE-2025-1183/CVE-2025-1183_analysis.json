No other relationships are applicable based on the provided information. The abstraction level of Base is appropriate given the direct nature of the **SQL injection**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe89 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain consists of:\n1.  **Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')** (CWE-89): The **weakness** is the **improper neutralization** that allows **SQL injection**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary assessment is strongly based on the provided evidence. The vulnerability description explicitly states that manipulating the `login_id` argument leads to **SQL injection** in the `/dashboard/admin/more-userprofile.php` file. This aligns directly with the definition of CWE-89, which involves **improper neutralization** of special elements used in an SQL command.\n\nThe Retriever Results also strongly support CWE-89 as the primary candidate, with a score of 1.0. The description of CWE-89 in \"Complete CWE Specifications\" confirms that it involves constructing SQL commands using externally-influenced input without proper neutralization.\n\nCWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')) was considered but is not applicable because the vulnerability involves **SQL injection**, not cross-site scripting. Similarly, CWE-434 (Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type) is irrelevant because the vulnerability is not related to file uploads.\n\nThe selection of CWE-89 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly describes the root cause of the vulnerability: **improper neutralization** leading to **SQL injection**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component. Without sufficient removal or quoting of SQL syntax in user-controllable inputs, the generated SQL query can cause those inputs to be interpreted as SQL instead of ordinary user data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.",
