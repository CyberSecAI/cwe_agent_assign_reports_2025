  "description": "Sage DPW before 2024_12_001 is vulnerable to **Incorrect Access Control**. The implemented role-based access controls are not always enforced on the server side. Low-privileged Sage users with employee role privileges can create external courses for other employees, even though they do not have the option to do so in the user interface. To do this, a valid request to create a course simply needs to be modified, so that the current user ID in the id parameter is replaced with the ID of another user.",

Here's an extraction of the relevant information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nIncorrect access control in Sage DPW allows unauthorized modification of course assignments between users.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Incorrect access control\n*   Authorization bypass\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nA user with the \"MA\" role can create a course for another user with the \"MA\" role, even if the latter does not have the permission to do so through the user interface. This leads to unauthorized course assignments.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** Intercepting a valid course creation request using an HTTP proxy.\n*   **Parameter Manipulation:** Modifying the `id` parameter in the intercepted request to represent the target user's ID instead of the attacker's.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   The attacker must have the \"MA\" role.\n*   The attacker needs the ability to intercept and modify HTTP requests (e.g., using a proxy).\n*   Network access to the Sage DPW application.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   Upgrade to version 2024\\_12\\_001 or later.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n*   **Affected Product:** Sage DPW\n*   **Affected Versions:** < 2024\\_12\\_001\n*   **Severity:** 4.3 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)\n*   **Discovered by:** Regina Kohl, BSc and Maximilian Zingerle, BSc\n*   **Vendor Contact Timeline:** Detailed timeline of vulnerability discovery, reporting, and fix release.",

The related CWE, CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key), highlights a specific mechanism of the authorization bypass where the attacker modifies the user ID parameter. Another related CWE, CWE-472 (External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter), identifies that the application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable. The abstraction levels of the selected CWEs are a Class (CWE-863) and a Base (CWE-639, CWE-472), providing a balance between generality and specificity.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n    cwe472[\"CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe639 -->|PEEROF| cwe472\n    cwe863 -->|PARENT| cwe285\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe639,cwe472,cwe285 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **Incorrect Access Control** (which leads to **Incorrect Authorization**) where the application fails to properly enforce authorization checks. This allows low-privileged users to bypass authorization by manipulating the user ID parameter in a request. This results in the ability to create external courses for other employees without proper authorization.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment pointed to CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) as the primary weakness, supported by the vulnerability description stating \"The implemented role-based access controls are not always enforced on the server side.\" The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this by identifying \"Incorrect access control\" and \"Authorization bypass\" as key weaknesses. The Retriever Results also list CWE-863 as the top combined result. The other CWEs listed in the Retriever Results are either too general (e.g., CWE-285, CWE-862) or represent specific attack vectors (e.g., CWE-639, CWE-472).\nThe relationship analysis reinforces the selection of CWE-863, as it is a more specific Class-level CWE than CWE-285 (Improper Authorization). The chain analysis highlights how the **incorrect authorization** leads directly to the ability to bypass access controls. The selection of CWE-863, CWE-639 and CWE-472 provides a detailed and accurate representation of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n**CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization**\nThe product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.\n\nThe vulnerability description states that \"The implemented role-based access controls are not always enforced on the server side,\" indicating that authorization checks are present but **incorrect**. This aligns directly with the definition of CWE-863.\n\n**CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key**\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\nThe vulnerability description states that \"a valid request to create a course simply needs to be modified, so that the current user ID in the id parameter is replaced with the ID of another user,\" demonstrating how an attacker can bypass authorization by modifying a user-controlled key (the user ID parameter).\n\n**CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter**\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\nThe vulnerability description indicates that the user ID parameter, which is assumed to be immutable and controlled by the server, is actually externally controllable, allowing attackers to modify it and bypass authorization.\n\nCWE-285 was considered but not used as it is a more general class of improper authorization, whereas CWE-863 explicitly states that the authorization is present but incorrect. CWE-862 was also considered, but it describes a complete absence of authorization checks, which is not the case here.",
