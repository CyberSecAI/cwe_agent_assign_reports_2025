  "description": "The The Design for Contact Form 7 Style WordPress Plugin CF7 WOW Styler plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary shortcode execution in all versions up to, and including, 1.7.0. This is due to the software allowing users to execute an action that does not properly validate a value before running do_shortcode. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary shortcodes. This functionality is also vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting. Version 1.7.0 patched the Reflected XSS issue, however, the arbitrary shortcode execution issue remains.",

This allows unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary shortcodes. The functionality is also vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting. The primary weakness is the **improper neutralization** of input, which aligns directly with CWE-79.\n\nThe key phrase \"does not properly validate a value before running do_shortcode\" points to the root cause being **improper input validation**. This allows for the execution of arbitrary shortcodes and XSS.\n\nCWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')) is selected as the primary CWE because the vulnerability description states that the plugin allows users to execute an action that does not properly validate a value before running do_shortcode, making it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary shortcodes and is also vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting. This directly corresponds to the **improper neutralization** of input during web page generation.\n\nOther CWEs Considered but Not Used:\n\n*   CWE-352 (Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)): While CSRF is a web application vulnerability, the description focuses on shortcode execution and XSS due to **improper input validation**, not a forged request.\n*   CWE-116 (Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output): Although encoding/escaping issues can be related to XSS, the primary issue is **improper input validation** before shortcode execution.\n*   CWE-138 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements): This is a more general class, and CWE-79 is more specific to web page generation.\n*   CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) and CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization): While authorization issues might be present, the core issue is the **improper handling of input** leading to shortcode execution.\n*   CWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')): SQL injection is not mentioned in the description.\n*   CWE-434 (Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type): File uploads are not mentioned.\n*   CWE-96 (Improper Neutralization of Directives in Statically Saved Code ('Static Code Injection')): While related to code injection, the vulnerability focuses on shortcode execution within a web page context, making CWE-79 a better fit.\n*   CWE-471 (Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID)): This CWE does not directly relate to the vulnerability described.\n\nThe confidence level is high (0.9) because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions **improper input validation** leading to arbitrary shortcode execution and XSS, which strongly aligns with the characteristics of CWE-79.",
