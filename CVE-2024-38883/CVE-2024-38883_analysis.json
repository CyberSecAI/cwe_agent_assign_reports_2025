There are no parent or child relationships that strongly influenced the choice, as CWE-757 is a Base level CWE and directly applicable.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe757[\"CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation ('Algorithm Downgrade')\"]\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe757 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward: The **selection of a less-secure algorithm** (CWE-757) leads directly to the ability for a remote attacker to perform a Drop Encryption Level attack, which is the impact.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the direct match between the vulnerability description and CWE-757, \"Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation ('Algorithm Downgrade')\". The vulnerability description explicitly states that the issue is due to the **selection of a less-secure algorithm** during negotiation, which aligns perfectly with the CWE.\n\nThe evidence is strong, as the vulnerability description contains the exact phrase that defines CWE-757. The retriever results also list CWE-757 as the top match.
