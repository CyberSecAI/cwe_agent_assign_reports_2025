Here's an extraction of the relevant information:\\n\\n**Vulnerability Description:**\\n\\nEnterprise Protection contains a vulnerability in attachment scanning that allows an unauthenticated attacker to bypass attachment scanning controls by sending an email with an S/MIME attachment signed with an opaque signature. This results in the message being delivered to the user's inbox in violation of the scanning policy. The vulnerability is due to improper input validation on the email attachment, as the S/MIME attachment is only signed and remains in plain text.\\n\\n**Root Cause:**\\n\\nImproper input validation on email attachments, specifically S/MIME attachments with opaque signatures.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\\n\\n*   Attachment scanning bypass\\n*   Improper input validation\\n\\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\\n\\nBypass of attachment scanning controls, leading to delivery of malicious attachments to users.\\n\\n**Attack Vectors:**\\n\\n*   Sending an email with an S/MIME attachment signed with an opaque signature.\\n*   No authentication required.\\n\\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\\n\\n*   Unauthenticated attacker\\n*   Ability to craft an email with a specially crafted S/MIME attachment.\\n\\n**Mitigation/Fix:**\\n\\n*   **Proofpoint On-Demand Customers:** No action required, fixes already deployed.\\n*   **Proofpoint On-Premises Customers:**\\n    *   If automatic updates are enabled, no action is required.\\n    *   If manual updates are configured, install the applicable release:\\n        *   8.18.6 patch 5110\\n        *   8.20.6 patch 5134\\n        *   8.21.0 patch 5112\\n        *   8.22.0 (unaffected - all patch levels)\\n*   Upgrade to a supported release if running an end-of-life version.\\n\\n**CVE Identifier:**\\n\\n*   CVE-2025-0431 (Note: the CVE description uses CVE-2024-10635, but the advisory uses CVE-2025-0431)\\n\\n**CVSS Score:**\\n\\n*   6.1 (Medium) - CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N/E:P/RL:U/RC:R\\n\\n**Additional Information:**\\n\\n*   Advisory ID: PFPT-SA-2025-0002\\n*   Initial Release Date: April 28, 2025\", similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {}, 'top_cwes_by_threshold': {}}}, similarity_summary=SimilarityInsight(consensus_cwe='', top_cwes=[], confidence_levels={}, total_samples=0), analysis='', analysis_with_relationships='', criticism='', resolution='', relevant_cwes=[{'metadata': {'doc_id': '356', 'name': 'Product UI does not Warn User of Unsafe Actions', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': \"The product's user interface does not warn the user before undertaking an unsafe action on behalf of that user.
