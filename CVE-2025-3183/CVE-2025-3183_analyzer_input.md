## Analysis of CVE-2025-3183 Content

This content **RELATES** to a vulnerability, but it's not directly tied to a CVE with ID CVE-2025-3183 as the CVE description is a placeholder. It details a SQL injection vulnerability in "Online Doctor Appointment Booking System PHP and Mysql" project version V1.0.  It provides more detail than a typical CVE description.

Here's the extracted information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to insufficient user input validation of the `patientFirstName` parameter in the `/patient/patientupdateprofile.php` file.  The parameter is used directly in SQL queries without proper cleaning or validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   SQL Injection

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Unauthorized database access
*   Sensitive data leakage
*   Data tampering
*   Comprehensive system control
*   Service interruption

**Attack vectors:**

*   The `/patient/patientupdateprofile.php` file is vulnerable.
*   No login or authorization is required to exploit the vulnerability.
*   The `patientFirstName` parameter (POST request) is the entry point for the attack.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to send a POST request to `/patient/patientupdateprofile.php` with a malicious payload in the `patientFirstName` parameter. No authentication is required.

**Mitigation or fix:**

1.  **Use prepared statements and parameter binding:** This separates SQL code from user input.
2.  **Input validation and filtering:**  Strictly validate and filter user input.
3.  **Minimize database user permissions:** Use accounts with the minimum necessary permissions.
4.  **Regular security audits:** Conduct regular security audits to identify and fix vulnerabilities.

**Payload Example:**

```
patientFirstName=1' AND (SELECT 4767 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))uPDn)-- PZMj&patientLastName=123&patientMaritialStatus=single&patientDOB=2025-02-26&patientGender=female&patientAddress=123&patientPhone=123&patientEmail=123&submit=Update Info
