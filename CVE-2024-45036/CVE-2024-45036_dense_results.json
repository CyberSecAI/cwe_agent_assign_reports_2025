  "query": "Tophat is a mobile applications testing harness. An Improper Access Control vulnerability can expose the `TOPHAT_APP_TOKEN` token stored in `~/.tophatrc` through use of a malicious Tophat URL controlled by the attacker. The vulnerability allows Tophat to send this token to the attackers server without any checks to ensure that the server is trusted. This token can then be used to access internal build artifacts, for mobile applications, not intended to be public. The issue has been patched as of version 1.10.0. The ability to request artifacts using a Tophat API has been deprecated as this flow was inherently insecure. Systems that have implemented this kind of endpoint should cease use and invalidate the token immediately. There are no workarounds and all users should update as soon as possible.",
