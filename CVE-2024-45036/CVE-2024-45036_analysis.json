  "description": "Tophat is a mobile applications testing harness. An **Improper Access Control** vulnerability can expose the `TOPHAT_APP_TOKEN` token stored in `~/.tophatrc` through use of a malicious Tophat URL controlled by the attacker. The vulnerability allows Tophat to send this token to the attackers server without any checks to ensure that the server is trusted. This token can then be used to access internal build artifacts, for mobile applications, not intended to be public. The issue has been patched as of version 1.10.0. The ability to request artifacts using a Tophat API has been deprecated as this flow was inherently insecure. Systems that have implemented this kind of endpoint should cease use and invalidate the token immediately. There are no workarounds and all users should update as soon as possible.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-45036:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability stems from the way the `tophat` tool handled artifact retrieval using a remote API endpoint. Specifically, the tool did not properly validate the server to which it was sending the `TOPHAT_APP_TOKEN`. This allowed an attacker to craft a malicious Tophat URL that would direct the tool to send the token to an attacker-controlled server.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Improper Access Control:** The primary weakness is the lack of access control in validating the destination server for sending the `TOPHAT_APP_TOKEN`. This token, stored in `~/.tophatrc`, was meant to be used to access build artifacts but was sent to an untrusted location.\n- **Lack of Server Trust Verification:** The tool did not verify the legitimacy of the server specified in the Tophat URL, leading to the token being exposed to an attacker.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Confidentiality Breach:** The `TOPHAT_APP_TOKEN` could be exposed, allowing the attacker to potentially access internal build artifacts, including those for mobile applications. This could lead to the unauthorized distribution and reverse engineering of proprietary mobile apps.\n- **Loss of Confidentiality (Low):** The CVSS score indicates a low impact on confidentiality since unauthorized access to internal build artifacts is possible but not guaranteed to have high-level repercussions.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Network (N):** The attack is performed over the network as the malicious URL is used to redirect token to attacker-controlled server.\n- **Malicious Tophat URL:** An attacker creates a specifically crafted Tophat URL that when processed by the vulnerable `tophat` tool would redirect the `TOPHAT_APP_TOKEN` to the attacker controlled server.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Network Accessibility:** An attacker would need to be able to host a server and craft a Tophat URL that would direct the vulnerable tool towards it.\n- **Social Engineering (Limited):** The attacker would need to trick a user into using the malicious Tophat URL with a vulnerable version of the `tophat` tool installed to obtain the `TOPHAT_APP_TOKEN`. This could be as simple as a link in a message or other form of communication.\n- **No Privileges Required:** The attacker does not need any special privileges on the user's system to carry out the attack.\n- **User Interaction Required:** The user needs to interact (e.g. click/open) with the malicious crafted URL for the attack to succeed.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n- The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.10.0 by deprecating the ability to request artifacts via an API endpoint, thus removing the insecure flow.\n- Affected versions are those below 1.10.0.\n- The advisory includes a CVSS v3 score of 4.3/10 with the vector string: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N\n- The issue is tracked as GHSA-p7xh-6hjr-mmg6 on GitHub.\n- The fix is linked to pull request #10 on the Shopify/tophat repository.\n- The security advisory labels the issue with \"Hackerone\" and \"security\" tags.",

The application performs an authorization check, but performs it incorrectly. |\n| CWE-668 | Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere | 0.6 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary Candidate. The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship is that CWE-863 is a Class-level CWE, and there might be a more specific Base-level CWE. However, based on the information provided, CWE-863 best fits the vulnerability description. CWE-668 is a higher-level CWE, and its usage is discouraged, but it could be a secondary classification because the token was exposed to the wrong sphere.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    \n    cwe942[\"CWE-942: Permissive Cross-domain Policy with Untrusted Domains\"]\n    cwe942 -->|CHILDOF| cwe863\n    cwe942 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe668\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe668 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **improper access control**, specifically, the application doesn't properly validate the destination server. This leads to the exposure of the `TOPHAT_APP_TOKEN` to an attacker-controlled server. The final impact is the potential unauthorized access to internal build artifacts.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified **Improper Access Control** as the root cause, which aligns with the description of CWE-863 as an authorization check performed incorrectly. The Retriever Results also indicated CWE-863 as the top candidate. The evidence from \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" strongly supports this, especially the \"Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present\" section, which mentions \"The primary weakness is the lack of access control in validating the destination server.\"\n\nThe relationship graph shows that CWE-863 can be related to CWE-668, which provides additional context about the exposure of resources to the wrong sphere.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-863 describes the core issue of incorrect authorization, while CWE-668 adds context about the resource exposure.
