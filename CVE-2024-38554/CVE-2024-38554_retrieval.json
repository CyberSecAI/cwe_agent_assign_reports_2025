When the ax25 device is shutting down, the ax25_dev_device_down() drops the reference count of net_device one or zero times depending on if we goto unlock_put or not, which will cause **memory leak**. In order to solve the above issue, decrease the reference count of net_device after dev->ax25_ptr is set to null.', key_phrases={'rootcause': '', 'weakness': ['memory leak', 'reference count leak'], 'impact': '', 'vector': '', 'attacker': '', 'product': 'Linux kernel', 'version': '', 'component': 'ax25_dev_device_down()'}, reference_content='The provided content describes a fix for a reference count leak issue in the Linux kernel\\'s AX.25 networking module. This corresponds to the provided CVE description.\\n\\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\\n- The `ax25_dev_device_down()` function in `net/ax25/ax25_dev.c` was not consistently decrementing the reference count of the `net_device` object during device shutdown. The reference count decrement was conditional on whether the code branched to the `unlock_put` label or not. If the condition is not met, the reference counter will not be decremented, leading to a leak.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\\n- **Reference count leak**: The `net_device` object\\'s reference counter could be decremented zero or one times leading to a memory leak on certain shutdown paths.\\n\\n**Impact of exploitation:**\\n- Memory leak: Repeatedly creating and shutting down AX.25 devices could lead to memory exhaustion as the `net_device` objects are not freed.\\n\\n**Attack vectors:**\\n- Triggering the device shutdown path in the AX.25 networking module.\\n\\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\\n- The attacker needs the ability to create and shutdown AX.25 network devices in the system.\\n\\n**Additional details:**\\n- The fix involves removing the conditional `goto unlock_put` branch, and unconditionally decrementing the `net_device` reference count after setting `dev->ax25_ptr` to NULL.\\n- The fix was backported to various stable kernel branches.\\n- The fix addresses the issue introduced by the commit \"ax25: add refcount in ax25_dev to avoid UAF bugs\" (d01ffb9eee4a).', similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {}, 'top_cwes_by_threshold': {}}}, similarity_summary=SimilarityInsight(consensus_cwe='', top_cwes=[], confidence_levels={}, total_samples=0), analysis='', analysis_with_relationships='', criticism='', resolution='', relevant_cwes=[{'metadata': {'doc_id': '911', 'name': 'Improper Update of Reference Count', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product uses a reference count to manage a resource, but it does not update or incorrectly updates the reference count.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'weakness:memory leak', 'keyphrase': 'memory leak', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'weakness:reference count leak', 'keyphrase': 'reference count leak', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'product:Linux kernel', 'keyphrase': 'Linux kernel', 'type': 'product'}, {'id': 'component:ax25_dev_device_down()', 'keyphrase': 'ax25_dev_device_down()', 'type': 'component'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(578.9753102984918)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '401', 'name': 'Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product does not sufficiently track and release allocated memory after it has been used, which slowly consumes remaining memory.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'weakness:memory leak', 'keyphrase': 'memory leak', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'weakness:reference count leak', 'keyphrase': 'reference count leak', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'product:Linux kernel', 'keyphrase': 'Linux kernel', 'type': 'product'}, {'id': 'component:ax25_dev_device_down()', 'keyphrase': 'ax25_dev_device_down()', 'type': 'component'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(468.0627957372682)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '190', 'name': 'Integer Overflow or Wraparound', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product performs a calculation that can\\n         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic\\n         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than\\n         the original value.
