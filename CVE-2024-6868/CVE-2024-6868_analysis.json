  "description": "mudler/LocalAI version 2.17.1 allows for arbitrary file write due to **improper handling of automatic archive extraction**. When model configurations specify additional files as archives (e.g., .tar), these archives are automatically extracted after downloading. This behavior can be exploited to perform a tarslip attack, allowing files to be written to arbitrary locations on the server, bypassing checks that normally restrict files to the models directory. This vulnerability can lead to remote code execution (RCE) by overwriting backend assets used by the server.",

The commit `a181dd0ebc5d3092fc50f61674d552604fe8ef9c` introduces a refactor of the gallery feature and a fix to prevent symlink creation during unarchiving.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe fix addresses a vulnerability related to symlink creation during the unarchiving process.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- The vulnerability lies in the `pkg/utils/untar.go` file which previously allowed symlinks to be created during the unarchiving process. This could lead to path traversal vulnerabilities or other issues if malicious archives are processed.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- If not addressed, a malicious actor could craft a specially crafted archive containing symlinks to arbitrary locations in the filesystem that could overwrite or modify files outside the intended target directory.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- The attack vector is by providing a malicious archive during the unarchive process.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- An attacker would need to be able to upload or provide the malicious archive to the application. This could be through an exposed API or other vulnerability.\n\nThe commit includes a fix which prevents symlink creation, which resolves the vulnerability.\n\n**Additional changes in the commit:**\n- Refactoring the gallery feature to move its related files under the `core/` directory.\n- Changes to config, CLI, HTTP endpoints and service files to reflect the move of gallery related components\n- Modifications in the import statements of multiple files.",

CWE-434 and CWE-59 are related because the vulnerability involves uploading and processing dangerous archive files, which can lead to link following issues.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe23[\"CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\"]\n    cwe434[\"CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\"]\n    cwe59[\"CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')\"]\n    \n    cwe23\n    cwe434\n    cwe59\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe23 primary\n    class cwe434,cwe59 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Improper handling of automatic archive extraction** (CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal).\n2.  The system automatically extracts archives after downloading, without properly sanitizing the file paths within the archive.\n3.  This allows for a tarslip attack, where files can be written to arbitrary locations.\n4.  **Impact:** Arbitrary file write, potentially leading to remote code execution (RCE).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment points to CWE-23 as the primary weakness, stemming from the **improper handling of automatic archive extraction** which leads to path traversal. The vulnerability description clearly states that the automatic extraction of archives is **improperly handled**, allowing for a tarslip attack to write files to arbitrary locations.\n\nCWE-434 is included because the vulnerability involves uploading and processing dangerous archive files. The archives are automatically processed, which aligns with CWE-434's description of dangerous file types being automatically processed within the environment.\n\nCWE-59 is a potential weakness due to the mention of symlink creation during the unarchiving process in the CVE reference. The commit addresses a vulnerability related to symlink creation during the unarchiving process, which could lead to path traversal vulnerabilities.\n\nThe evidence supports CWE-23 as the primary weakness, with CWE-434 and CWE-59 as contributing factors.
