This vulnerability affects the function ReadConfiguration of the file /opt/MicroWorld/etc/mwav.conf. The manipulation of the argument BasePath leads to buffer overflow. Local access is required to approach this attack. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",
