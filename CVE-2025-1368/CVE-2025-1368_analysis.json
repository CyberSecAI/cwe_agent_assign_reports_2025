  "description": "A vulnerability was found in MicroWord eScan Antivirus 7.0.32 on Linux. It has been declared as problematic. This vulnerability affects the function ReadConfiguration of the file /opt/MicroWorld/etc/mwav.conf. The manipulation of the argument BasePath leads to **buffer overflow**. Local access is required to approach this attack. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",

The vulnerability involves a **buffer overflow** due to unchecked input size during a copy operation. |\n| CWE-119 | Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer | 0.5 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary candidate. This is a more general case of memory corruption. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-120, which is a base-level CWE detailing a specific type of **buffer overflow**. CWE-119 is a broader class that encompasses various memory buffer issues, but CWE-120 provides a more precise classification given the vulnerability description.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe120[\"CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    \n    cwe120 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe120 primary\n    class cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **buffer overflow** in the `ReadConfiguration` function, specifically due to the manipulation of the `BasePath` argument, leading to a memory corruption issue.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is a **buffer overflow** in the `ReadConfiguration` function of MicroWord eScan Antivirus due to improper handling of the `BasePath` argument. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions a **buffer overflow**, making CWE-120 the most suitable choice. The retriever results also list CWE-120 as a potential match.
