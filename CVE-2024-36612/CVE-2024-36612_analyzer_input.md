- **component:** handling of popovers

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2024-36612:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a race condition in the way Zulip handles popovers. When a user interacts with a popover (e.g., clicking a button inside it) and that action triggers the opening of a modal, the code attempts to hide all popovers using `popovers.hide_all()`. However, the event handler for the popover's button click might still be executing. This leads to a scenario where `instance.hide()` is called again on the popover after it has already been hidden, resulting in the `tippy.js` library (which Zulip uses for popovers) throwing errors and potentially causing a memory leak.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Race Condition:** The core issue is a race condition where the attempt to hide all popovers clashes with the ongoing event handling within a popover.
*   **Improper Popover Management:** The code lacked a mechanism to ensure a popover was visible before attempting to hide it, leading to redundant hide calls.
*  **Memory Leak**: As described by the commit message, it is implied that the tippy.js library logs errors because the popover might already be hidden, which could lead to a memory leak.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Memory Leak:** The vulnerability can cause memory leaks, which can potentially lead to performance degradation.
*   **Error logs**: The tippy.js library will log errors when this issue happens.
*   **Unexpected application behavior:** Redundant `hide()` calls may interfere with how the popover is intended to behave, which can result in unexpected behavior.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **User Interaction:** The vulnerability is triggered by normal user interactions with the application when using popovers. Specifically, when users try to open a modal after clicking a button in a popover, they trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   No special attacker capabilities are required beyond being a user of the application. Any user who is interacting with the affected popovers can cause the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content contains the fix for this vulnerability, which involves adding a wrapper function `hide_current_popover_if_visible` around `instance.hide()` to check if the popover is currently visible before attempting to hide it.
*   The vulnerability was present in Zulip versions from 8.0 to 8.3.
*   The patch was implemented in commit `0a90a13becbf0338a8fc1ad37946e51c2c25b0a5`
