  "description": "CodiMD allows realtime collaborative markdown notes on all platforms. CodiMD before 2.5.4 is **missing authentication and access control** vulnerability allowing an unauthenticated attacker to gain unauthorised access to image data uploaded to CodiMD. CodiMD does not require valid authentication to access uploaded images or to upload new image data. An attacker who can determine an uploaded images URL can gain unauthorised access to uploaded image data. Due to the insecure random filename generation in the underlying Formidable library, an attacker can determine the filenames for previously uploaded images and the likelihood of this issue being exploited is increased. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.5.4.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n\n*   The primary root cause is the lack of authentication and access controls for uploaded images in CodiMD when using the Filesystem upload backend.\n*   Secondary root cause is the use of the Formidable library's insecure random filename generation, making it easier for attackers to discover file paths.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Missing Authentication and Access Control (CWE-862):** CodiMD does not require authentication to access or upload image data. This allows unauthorized users to access any image if they know the URL or upload arbitrary files.\n*   **Insecure Randomness (CWE-338):** The Formidable library, used by CodiMD, employs the `hexoid` library to generate random filenames. This library uses `Math.random()`, which is a weak random number generator, to create prefixes. It also uses an incrementing suffix. This predictable pattern allows attackers to guess or enumerate filenames of uploaded files.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can gain access to any uploaded images, including those intended to be private.\n*   **Data Exposure:** Private images could be viewed by unauthorized parties.\n*   **Denial of Service:** Attackers can upload arbitrary image data, potentially exhausting disk space and causing a denial of service.\n*   **Malicious Uploads:** An attacker can upload malicious images, possibly leading to further attacks.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Direct URL Access:** An attacker can directly access uploaded images if they know the URL.\n*   **Filename Enumeration:** An attacker can upload a file, determine the file prefix, and then guess the filenames of other files by incrementing the suffix and trying known mime types.\n*   **Unauthenticated Uploads:** Attackers can upload files without authentication, facilitating both unauthorized access and DoS attacks.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the CodiMD instance.\n*   **No Prior Knowledge Required:** The attacker does not need valid user credentials.\n*   **Ability to Send HTTP Requests:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the CodiMD server to upload files and access the uploaded images\n\n**Additional details from the content:**\n\n* The advisory notes that the issue was discovered during normal application use.\n* It provides specific curl commands that demonstrate how to upload and access images without authentication.\n* It shows example code snippets from the vulnerable section of code, and the vulnerable library (`hexoid`).\n* Provides a detailed explanation of how the insecure filename generation works.\n* Provides a code diff illustrating how to resolve the issue.\n* It uses the term discretionary access control to emphasize that knowledge of a URL should not replace authorization controls\n* A CVSS score and base metrics are provided\n* Includes CWE-338 and CWE-862\n\nThis content provides significantly more detail than a typical CVE description, including the attack vectors, a detailed explanation of the vulnerable code, and remediation advice.",

Because the vulnerability description explicitly states that authentication is **missing**, CWE-306 is the more specific and appropriate choice over the more general CWE-287. The relationship between CWE-330 and CWE-804 was also considered.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe330[\"CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\"]\n    cwe804[\"CWE-804: Guessable CAPTCHA\"]\n\n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe804 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe330\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe306 primary\n    class cwe330 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the **missing authentication** (CWE-306), which allows for unauthorized access. This is compounded by the **use of insufficiently random values** (CWE-330) in filename generation, making it easier for attackers to guess the URLs of uploaded images. The ultimate impact is unauthorized access to image data and potential for malicious uploads.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-306 as the primary weakness due to the explicit statement of **missing authentication and access control**. This is supported by the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section, which lists \"**missing authentication and access control**\" as the **rootcause**. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section also explicitly states \"CodiMD does not require authentication to access or upload image data.\"\n\nThe Retriever Results suggested other CWEs, such as CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key) and CWE-425 (Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')). However, these are less relevant because the issue is not about bypassing authorization but rather the complete absence of authentication.\n\nCWE-330 (Use of Insufficiently Random Values) is included as a secondary weakness because the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" identifies insecure filename generation as contributing to the exploitability of the **missing authentication** vulnerability. Specifically, weak randomness increases the likelihood of guessing image URLs, thus amplifying the impact of CWE-306.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-306 is a Base level CWE that directly addresses the **missing authentication**. While CWE-330 is a Class, a more specific child is not obviously applicable, but the evidence supports the lack of secure random number generation.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\n| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| CWE-306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | 1 | Base | Primary | Allowed |\n\n**CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function**\nThe product does not perform any authentication for functionality that requires a provable user identity or consumes a significant amount of resources.\nThe vulnerability description states, \"CodiMD before 2.5.4 is **missing authentication and access control** vulnerability allowing an unauthenticated attacker to gain unauthorised access to image data uploaded to CodiMD.\" This directly aligns with the definition of CWE-306. The impact is unauthorized access to uploaded images. This is the primary weakness.\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| CWE-330 | Use of Insufficiently Random Values | 0.8 | Class | Secondary | Discouraged |\n\n**CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values**\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\nThe vulnerability description notes that the Formidable library uses insecure random filename generation, which increases the likelihood of the issue being exploited. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section details the `hexoid` library's use of `Math.random()` and an incrementing suffix, making filenames predictable. This aligns with CWE-330.
