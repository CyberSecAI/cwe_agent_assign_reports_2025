  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Vulnerability Type:** Prototype Pollution\n\n**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the way the functions `empty`, `util.clone`, `util.prop`, `util.deep`, and `make` handle input arguments. They do not properly sanitize or validate input, allowing an attacker to inject a `__proto__` property, which can modify the base `Object.prototype`.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n*   **Unvalidated Input:** The vulnerable functions do not properly validate input properties, allowing the `__proto__` property to be passed in.\n*   **Prototype Modification:** The injected `__proto__` property is used to directly modify the prototype of all objects.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By modifying the prototype, an attacker can cause unexpected behavior in the application, leading to crashes or hangs.\n*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Depending on the gadgets and properties available within the application's environment, prototype pollution can lead to RCE.\n*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** In certain scenarios, modifying the prototype can affect how data is rendered in the browser, potentially leading to XSS attacks.\n*   **Application Logic Alteration:** The core functionality of the application may be modified by polluting properties of the base object.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n*   The attacker must be able to call the vulnerable functions directly or indirectly, passing specially crafted arguments.\n* The payload to be injected is an object with the `__proto__` property.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n*   The attacker needs to be able to call or trigger the execution of the vulnerable functions: `empty`, `util.clone`, `util.prop`, `util.deep`, and `make`.\n*   The attacker can pass a crafted JSON object containing `__proto__` to modify the properties of the Object prototype.\n\n**Affected Component(s):** `empty`, `util.clone`, `util.prop`, `util.deep`, `make`\n\n**Affected Package:**\n*   Product: `@jsonic/jsonic-next`\n*   Version: `2.12.1`\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n*   The advisory highlights that the vulnerable functions are internal and undocumented.\n*   A proof-of-concept (PoC) is provided, demonstrating how to exploit the vulnerability.\n*   The vendor has requested a reproduction using the actual API (`Jsonic(...)`). This indicates that while the vulnerability is present in the described utility functions, the vendor might not consider it a vulnerability if those functions are not intended to be directly exposed to the end user.\n\nThis information is based on the provided content and is more detailed than a simple placeholder CVE description would offer.",
