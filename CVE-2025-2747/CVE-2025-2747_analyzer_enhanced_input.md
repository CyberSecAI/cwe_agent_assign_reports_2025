## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information extracted from the provided content, focusing on CVE-2025-2747 (Note: The content provided does not explicitly mention a CVE ID. Information about the vulnerability is presented as WT-2025-0011, WT-2025-0006 and WT-2025-0007):

**Vulnerability:** WT-2025-0011 Authentication Bypass (More detail than the official CVE description)

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The root cause is found in the obsolete Microsoft Web Service Enhancement 3.0 (WSE3) library, specifically the `Microsoft.Web.Services3.Security.Tokens.UsernameTokenManager.VerifyPassword` method. This method does not properly validate the lack of a password when the `PasswordOption` is set to `SendNone`, allowing authentication bypass.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   Authentication Bypass: The vulnerability allows bypassing authentication on the Kentico Xperience CMS Staging API.
    *   Logical Flaw in WSE3 library: The library's design allows authentication without a password when `PasswordOption.SendNone` is set.
*   **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   Full administrative access to the Kentico's Staging SOAP API.
    *   Access with "global admin" rights.
    *   Allows the attacker to fully control the Kentico Xperience CMS.
*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   Crafting a malicious SOAP request header.
    *   The attack involves sending a SOAP request to the `/CMSPages/Staging/SyncServer.asmx` endpoint.
    *   The SOAP header should contain a `<wsse:UsernameToken>` element with the `<wsse:Username>` tag and without the `<wsse:Password>` tag.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   The attacker needs to send a crafted SOAP request to the target system.
    *   In versions 13.0.173 to 13.0.177, the attacker must know a valid Staging Service username.
    *   Prior to version 13.0.173, one can provide any username.
*   **Mitigation or fix:**
    *   Fixed in Kentico Xperience 13.0.178.

**Vulnerability:** WT-2025-0006 Authentication Bypass (More detail than the official CVE description)

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is an authentication bypass in the Kentico Xperience CMS Staging API.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   Authentication Bypass: The vulnerability allows bypassing authentication on the Kentico Xperience CMS Staging API.
*   **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   Full administrative access to the Kentico's Staging SOAP API.
    *   Access with "global admin" rights.
    *   Allows the attacker to fully control the Kentico Xperience CMS.
*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   Crafting a malicious SOAP request header.
    *   The attack involves sending a SOAP request to the `/CMSPages/Staging/SyncServer.asmx` endpoint.
*   **Mitigation or fix:**
    *   Fixed in Kentico Xperience 13.0.173.

**Vulnerability:** WT-2025-0007 Post-Auth Remote Code Execution (More detail than the official CVE description)

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Path traversal vulnerability within the media file upload functionality of the Kentico Xperience CMS. The `CheckAndEnsureFilePath` method does not adequately validate the `librarySubFolderPath` parameter, allowing for directory traversal.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   Path Traversal: The attacker can specify a path (e.g., `../../../../../../../../inetpub/wwwroot/Kentico13/CMS/CMSPages/`) in the `FilePath` field of a media file upload, leading to the ability to write files to arbitrary locations on the server.
    *   Remote Code Execution: Because of the path traversal vulnerability, the attacker can upload a webshell file and execute arbitrary code.
*   **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   Remote Code Execution: An attacker can upload and execute arbitrary code on the server by uploading a webshell via a path traversal vulnerability.
*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   Combining Authentication Bypass (WT-2025-0006 or WT-2025-0011) with the path traversal vulnerability in the Staging API.
    *   The attack involves crafting a SOAP request to the `/CMSPages/Staging/SyncServer.asmx` endpoint.
    *   Upload a malicious file (e.g., a webshell aspx file).
    *   Exploit path traversal vulnerability by modifying the `FilePath` in the `Media_File` section of the SOAP request.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   Access to the Staging API (achieved through Authentication Bypass).
    *   Knowledge of the file system structure of the target system.
*   **Mitigation or fix:**
    *   Fixed in Kentico Xperience 13.0.178.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control

**Authentication**:
Determines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.

* Example phrases: "user must log in", "lack of login check", "bypasses login"
* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.

  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* – used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).

**Authorization**:
Determines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do. It decides access *after* identity is verified.

* Example phrases: "unauthorized access", "regular user can access admin panel", "role checks are missing"
* CWE relevance: use CWEs like 862, 863, 285 for authorization errors:

  * **CWE-862**: *Missing Authorization* – the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all.
  * **CWE-863**: *Incorrect Authorization* – the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).
  * **CWE-285**: *Improper Authorization* – general category for any flawed authorization logic or design.

**Access Control**:
A broader term that includes both authentication and authorization. Governs how resources are protected and who can access them under what conditions.

* CWE relevance:

  * **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* – top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear.
  * This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.

## Mapping Discussion – Common Misclassification Patterns

### 1. **CWE-306 vs CWE-862**:

* **306** is about lack of **authentication** (e.g., *no login required at all*).
* **862** is about lack of **authorization** *after* authentication (e.g., *admin check missing*).
* ✅ Example CWE-306: *“An unauthenticated attacker can invoke the password reset API.”*
* ✅ Example CWE-862: *“An authenticated user without admin privileges can delete any user account.”*

### 2. **CWE-285 vs CWE-284**:

* **285** is specific to authorization flaws – it's a better choice than 284 **if** the issue involves *improper or missing role checks*.
* **284** should be reserved for general access control issues when it’s unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.

---

## Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification

**Phrase like "unauthorized access" is not enough.**

* If you **cannot determine whether identity was checked**, assume it’s **authorization** and consider 862 or 863.
* If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** → CWE-306.
* If the **access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced**, but it's not due to missing checks, consider **CWE-284**.

---

## Good Mapping Examples

* ✅ **CWE-306**: “The endpoint `/admin/deleteUser` does not require any authentication.”
* ✅ **CWE-862**: “Any logged-in user can change any other user's email without being an admin.”
* ✅ **CWE-863**: “An admin check exists but incorrectly grants access to non-admin users.”
* ✅ **CWE-285**: “Application uses a static role check that fails when roles change dynamically.”
* ✅ **CWE-284**: “Inconsistent enforcement of access rules across services with unclear policy source.”

| **Indicator**                                              | **Likely CWE** |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| No identity check (no login)                               | CWE-306        |
| No role/privilege check after login                        | CWE-862        |
| Role check is present but flawed                           | CWE-863        |
| General or ambiguous authorization failure                 | CWE-285        |
| High-level access control problem with no clear root cause | CWE-284        |
