CWE-200 is related to the potential impact of the vulnerability, specifically the exposure of sensitive information. The selection of CWE-79 as the primary CWE is based on its direct relevance to the **HTML injection** vulnerability, while CWE-80 could be a more specific case if the injection is related to HTML tags. CWE-200 represents a potential consequence. The base level of abstraction for CWE-79 is preferred, but the variant level of CWE-80 is also considered due to its specificity.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe80[\"CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe80 -->|CHILDOF| cwe79\n    cwe79 -->|CANLEADTO| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe79 primary\n    class cwe80,cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **HTML injection** (CWE-79), which can lead to modification of the page content seen by the user or disclosure of sensitive information (CWE-200). The specific type of HTML injection could involve script-related HTML tags (CWE-80).\n  - Root Cause: CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n  - Impact: CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-79 as the primary candidate due to the **HTML injection** vulnerability. The retriever results also strongly suggest CWE-79. The relationship analysis confirmed that CWE-80 is a more specific variant of CWE-79. CWE-200 was considered as a potential impact of the vulnerability. The final decision is based on the evidence of **HTML injection**, leading to the selection of CWE-79 as the primary CWE. CWE-80 is a secondary candidate if the injection specifically involves HTML tags. CWE-200 is a secondary candidate as a potential consequence of the injection. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-79 representing the general weakness and CWE-80 providing a more specific variant.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
