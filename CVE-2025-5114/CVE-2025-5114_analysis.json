  "description": "A vulnerability has been found in easysoft zentaopms 21.5_20250307 and classified as critical. This vulnerability affects the function Edit of the file /index.php?m=editor&f=edit&filePath=cGhhcjovLy9ldGMvcGFzc3dk&action=edit of the component Committer. The manipulation of the argument filePath leads to **deserialization**. The attack can be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",
