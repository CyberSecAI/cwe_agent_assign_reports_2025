  "vulnerability_info": "VulnerabilityInfo(cve_id='CVE-2024-38575', description='In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved wifi brcmfmac pcie handle randbuf allocation failure The kzalloc() in brcmf_pcie_download_fw_nvram() will return null if the physical memory has run out. As a result, if we use get_random_bytes() to generate random bytes in the randbuf, the **null pointer dereference** bug will happen. In order to prevent allocation failure, this patch adds a separate function using buffer on kernel stack to generate random bytes in the randbuf, which could prevent the kernel stack from **overflow**.', key_phrases={'rootcause': '', 'weakness': ['null pointer dereference', 'overflow'], 'impact': 'denial of service', 'vector': 'physical memory running out', 'attacker': '', 'product': 'Linux kernel', 'version': '', 'component': 'brcmf_pcie_download_fw_nvram()'}, reference_content=\"Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\\n\\n**Root Cause:**\\n\\nThe root cause of the vulnerability is a potential null pointer dereference in the `brcmf_pcie_download_fw_nvram` function within the `brcmfmac` driver. Specifically, the function allocates memory for a random buffer (`randbuf`) using `kzalloc`. If `kzalloc` fails (due to memory exhaustion), it returns `NULL`. Subsequently, the code attempts to use `get_random_bytes` with this possibly null pointer, leading to a crash.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\\n\\n*   **Null Pointer Dereference:** The primary vulnerability is the dereference of a null pointer. If `kzalloc` fails to allocate memory, the `randbuf` pointer will be `NULL`. The subsequent call to `get_random_bytes(randbuf, rand_len)` will result in a null pointer dereference and a kernel crash.\\n*   **Lack of Error Handling:** The original code lacked proper error handling after `kzalloc`. It did not check if the allocation was successful before proceeding to use the allocated memory.\\n\\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\\n\\n*   **Kernel Crash:** The primary impact of exploiting this vulnerability is a kernel crash due to the null pointer dereference, leading to a denial-of-service.\\n*   **System Instability:** A kernel crash can lead to system instability and unexpected downtime.\\n\\n**Attack Vectors:**\\n\\n*   **Memory Exhaustion:** An attacker could potentially trigger this vulnerability by causing memory exhaustion on the system, forcing `kzalloc` to fail, leading to the null pointer dereference. This can occur due to various activities that consume system memory.\\n\\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\\n\\n*   **Ability to Cause Memory Pressure:** An attacker needs to be able to cause sufficient memory pressure on the system to trigger the `kzalloc` failure. This might involve running resource-intensive processes or exploiting other memory-related vulnerabilities.\\n*   **Local/Remote Access:** It is not specified if this is triggerable locally or remotely, but given it is a memory allocation issue, it is likely local with a privileged user that has the ability to exhaust memory.\\n\\n**Mitigation:**\\n\\nThe provided patch fixes the vulnerability by replacing the dynamic allocation with a stack allocated buffer using a new helper function called `brcmf_pcie_provide_random_bytes`. Instead of using `kzalloc`, a fixed-size buffer `randbuf` is allocated on the stack, thus avoiding the possibility of allocation failure and a null pointer dereference.\\nThe patch includes the following changes:\\n\\n*   A new function `brcmf_pcie_provide_random_bytes` is introduced, allocating `randbuf` on the stack.\\n*   The `get_random_bytes` and `memcpy_toio` calls are moved into the new function using the stack allocated buffer.\\n*   The dynamic allocation using `kzalloc`, the null check, and the `kfree` call were removed.\\n\\nThis ensures that even under memory pressure, the random bytes are generated without a risk of a null pointer dereference.\", similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {}, 'top_cwes_by_threshold': {}}}, similarity_summary=SimilarityInsight(consensus_cwe='', top_cwes=[], confidence_levels={}, total_samples=0), analysis='', analysis_with_relationships='', criticism='', resolution='', relevant_cwes=[{'metadata': {'doc_id': '476', 'name': 'NULL Pointer Dereference', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product dereferences a pointer that it expects to be valid but is NULL.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'weakness:null pointer dereference', 'keyphrase': 'null pointer dereference', 'type': 'weakness'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(512.6841279775874)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '665', 'name': 'Improper Initialization', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product does not initialize or incorrectly initializes a resource, which might leave the resource in an unexpected state when it is accessed or used.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'weakness:null pointer dereference', 'keyphrase': 'null pointer dereference', 'type': 'weakness'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(466.1403725614957)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '190', 'name': 'Integer Overflow or Wraparound', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product performs a calculation that can\\n         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic\\n         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than\\n         the original value.

As a result, if we use get_random_bytes() to generate random bytes in the randbuf, the **null pointer dereference** bug will happen.

CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size (Score: 162.32)\n\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow....\n\n## PRODUCT: 'Linux kernel'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this PRODUCT:\n\n### 1. CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound (Score: 461.21)\n\nThe product performs a calculation that can\n         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic\n         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than\n         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is\n         incremented to a value that is too large to st...\n\n### 2. CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling (Score: 445.42)\n\nThe product allocates a reusable resource or group of resources on behalf of an actor without imposing any restrictions on the size or number of resources that can be allocated, in violation of the intended security policy for that actor....\n\n### 3. CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value (Score: 442.67)\n\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated....\n\n### 4. CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input (Score: 440.35)\n\nThe product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties....\n\n### 5. CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read (Score: 438.42)\n\nThe product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer....\n\n## COMPONENT: 'brcmf_pcie_download_fw_nvram()'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this COMPONENT:\n\n### 1.
