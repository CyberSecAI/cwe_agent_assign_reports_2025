  "description": "webcrack is a tool for reverse engineering javascript. An arbitrary file write vulnerability exists in the webcrack module when processing specifically crafted malicious code on Windows systems. This vulnerability is triggered when using the unpack bundles feature in conjunction with the saving feature. If a module name includes a **path traversal** sequence with Windows path separators, an attacker can exploit this to overwrite files on the host system. This vulnerability allows an attacker to write arbitrary `.js` files to the host system, which can be leveraged to hijack legitimate Node.js modules to gain arbitrary code execution. This vulnerability has been patched in version 2.14.1.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from the use of the POSIX version of Node.js path utilities (`dirname`, `join`, `normalize`) when processing and saving modules on Windows systems. The `normalize` function in the POSIX path utility does not recognize backslashes (`\\`) as path separators, which are used in Windows file paths. This discrepancy allows path traversal sequences using backslashes to bypass the intended path validation and allows writing to arbitrary locations.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n\n*   **Path Traversal:** The application fails to properly sanitize module paths, allowing an attacker to use path traversal sequences with backslashes to write files outside the intended output directory.\n*   **Improper Input Validation:** The code relies on `posix.normalize`, which does not handle Windows-style paths correctly, leading to ineffective path traversal checks on Windows.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Arbitrary File Write:** Attackers can write arbitrary JavaScript files to the host system.\n*   **Code Execution:** By overwriting legitimate Node.js modules (e.g., the `debug` module, as shown in the PoC), attackers can achieve arbitrary code execution when the application loads these modified modules.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Malicious Input:** The attacker crafts a malicious JavaScript bundle, specifically using backslashes in the module paths.\n*   **Webcrack Functionality:** The vulnerability is triggered when the `webcrack` tool's \"unpack bundles\" feature is used in conjunction with its \"save\" feature to write extracted module files to disk.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   The attacker needs to be able to supply crafted JavaScript input to the `webcrack` tool.\n*   The attacker needs to target a Windows system where the application is run.\n*   User interaction is required since the user needs to run the webcrack script and process the malicious bundle.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n*   The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) shows how to exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious JavaScript file (`what.js`) with a path traversal sequence that overwrites the `debug` module.\n*   The vulnerability is fixed by using `path.normalize` instead of `posix.normalize` which will correctly handle windows path separators\n\n**CVE Information:**\n\n*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2024-43373\n*   **Affected versions:** <= 2.14.0\n*   **Patched versions:** 2.14.1\n*   **CVSS Score:** 7.7 High (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:L)\n*   **CWEs:** CWE-20, CWE-22",

The vulnerability involves a **path traversal** issue where the software **improperly limits a pathname** to a restricted directory, allowing access to resources outside the intended scope. |\n| CWE-73 | External Control of File Name or Path | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The vulnerability involves **external control of file name or path** by allowing user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations. |\n| CWE-94 | Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection') | 0.6 | Base | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary CWE.

The application **does not properly sanitize** module paths. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary weakness is CWE-22, which describes the **improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory**, leading to **path traversal**. CWE-22 is a base-level CWE. CWE-73 (External Control of File Name or Path) is related because the vulnerability involves user-controlled input influencing file paths, which can precede the **path traversal**. CWE-94 is related because the impact of the vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution. CWE-20 is related because the root cause is **improper input validation**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\"]\n    cwe73[\"CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\"]\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n\n    cwe22 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe73\n    cwe73 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe22\n    cwe22 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe94\n    cwe20 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe22\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe22 primary\n    class cwe73,cwe94,cwe20 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper input validation (CWE-20)**, which allows for **external control of file name or path (CWE-73)**. This leads to an **improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory ('Path Traversal') (CWE-22)**, ultimately resulting in **improper control of generation of code ('Code Injection') (CWE-94)**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the vulnerability description and the provided CVE reference links content summary. The primary weakness is clearly a **path traversal (CWE-22)** vulnerability, supported by the description of **improper input sanitization** and the ability to overwrite files outside the intended directory. The relationship graph helped visualize the connections between CWEs, confirming the chain of events. The selected CWEs are at the appropriate level of specificity, accurately representing the root cause and impact of the vulnerability. The vulnerability description clearly indicates a **path traversal** issue due to **improper input sanitization**, making CWE-22 the most appropriate primary CWE. Other CWEs such as CWE-59 (Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')) and CWE-41 (Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence) were considered but deemed less relevant as the primary issue is related to path traversal and not symlink handling or path equivalence. CWE-94 is used since the end result is the ability to inject Javascript code. CWE-20 is used since the rootcause of the problem is based on **improper input validation**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-178: Improper Handling of Case Sensitivity\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly account for differences in case sensitivity when accessing or determining the properties of a resource, leading to inconsistent results.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-427: Uncontrolled Search Path Element\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a fixed or controlled search path to find resources, but one or more locations in that path can be under the control of unintended actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
