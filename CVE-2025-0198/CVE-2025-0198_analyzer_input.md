## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2025-0198 (Note: The CVE description is a placeholder as requested.)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the `search_result.php` file of the `pos-inventory-system-in-php` project. The application directly uses user-supplied input (`id` parameter) in an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the injection of malicious SQL code through the `id` parameter. This lack of input validation allows an attacker to modify the intended SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** A successful exploit can allow an attacker to access, modify, or delete sensitive data from the database. This can include user credentials, financial data, and other confidential information.
- **Potential for Further Attacks:** In some scenarios, SQL injection can lead to more severe attacks, such as gaining remote access to the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted HTTP GET request to the `search_result.php` file. The attacker modifies the `id` parameter with malicious SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable application.
- **Basic Web Application Knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand how to manipulate HTTP requests and have a basic understanding of SQL injection techniques.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable parameter is `$id` in `search_result.php`.
- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates a successful SQL injection by using the payload `1'+or+1=1--+-` in the `id` parameter of the GET request.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerable project is identified as "pos-inventory-system-in-php".
- The original source is located at `https://code-projects.org/pos-inventory-system-using-php-source-code/`.
- The provided PoC demonstrates a basic SQL injection; a more skilled attacker could use this to extract more valuable data or even escalate privileges.
