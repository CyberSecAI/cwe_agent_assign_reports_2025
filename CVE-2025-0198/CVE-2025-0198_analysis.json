  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**CVE ID:** CVE-2025-0198 (Note: The CVE description is a placeholder as requested.)\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n- The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the `search_result.php` file of the `pos-inventory-system-in-php` project. The application directly uses user-supplied input (`id` parameter) in an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the injection of malicious SQL code through the `id` parameter. This lack of input validation allows an attacker to modify the intended SQL query.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Data Breach:** A successful exploit can allow an attacker to access, modify, or delete sensitive data from the database. This can include user credentials, financial data, and other confidential information.\n- **Potential for Further Attacks:** In some scenarios, SQL injection can lead to more severe attacks, such as gaining remote access to the server.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted HTTP GET request to the `search_result.php` file. The attacker modifies the `id` parameter with malicious SQL code.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable application.\n- **Basic Web Application Knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand how to manipulate HTTP requests and have a basic understanding of SQL injection techniques.\n\n**Technical Details:**\n- The vulnerable parameter is `$id` in `search_result.php`.\n- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates a successful SQL injection by using the payload `1'+or+1=1--+-` in the `id` parameter of the GET request.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The vulnerable project is identified as \"pos-inventory-system-in-php\".\n- The original source is located at `https://code-projects.org/pos-inventory-system-using-php-source-code/`.\n- The provided PoC demonstrates a basic SQL injection; a more skilled attacker could use this to extract more valuable data or even escalate privileges.",

The description explicitly states that the manipulation of the `id` argument leads to **SQL Injection**, and the CVE reference confirms that the application uses user-supplied input in an SQL query without proper sanitization.\n\nThe graph relationships confirm that CWE-89 is the primary and most specific weakness.
