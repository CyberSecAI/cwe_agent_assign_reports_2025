  "description": "The Jupyter Server provides the backend for Jupyter web applications. Jupyter Server on Windows has a vulnerability that lets unauthenticated attackers leak the NTLMv2 password hash of the Windows user running the Jupyter server. An attacker can crack this password to gain access to the Windows machine hosting the Jupyter server, or access other network-accessible machines or 3rd party services using that credential. Or an attacker perform an NTLM relay attack without cracking the credential to gain access to other network-accessible machines. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.14.1.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-35178:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability lies in the `filefind` function of the `jupyter_server` package on Windows. Prior to the fix, the function did not properly validate if a resolved file path was within the allowed directory. Specifically, it would attempt to resolve absolute paths and if the file existed, return the path. This allowed a user to craft a malicious file path, which when resolved, would trigger the Windows NTLM authentication mechanism.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n- **NTLM Hash Leak:** When a file path including a UNC path to a malicious server (e.g., `\\\\attacker\\share\\file.txt`) was passed to the vulnerable `filefind` function, the Windows system would attempt NTLM authentication to the attacker's server, thereby disclosing the user's NTLMv2 password hash.\n- **Lack of proper path validation:** The `filefind` function did not properly validate that the file path was within the allowed directories, especially when dealing with absolute and UNC paths. This allowed a malicious actor to specify a network location in the path.\n- **Reliance on os.path.isfile:** Checking for file existence without first ensuring the path was within expected bounds enabled the vulnerability.\n- **Acceptance of absolute paths:** The `filefind` function was accepting absolute paths, which are not expected in its design. This can lead to path traversal and leakage of sensitive information, since resolving the path will cause the system to access the remote location.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n- **NTLMv2 Password Hash Leakage:** An attacker can obtain the NTLMv2 password hash of the Windows user running the Jupyter server.\n- **Credential cracking:** The leaked NTLMv2 password hash can be cracked, potentially granting the attacker access to the Windows machine hosting the Jupyter server.\n- **Network access:** An attacker can use the stolen credentials to access other network-accessible machines or 3rd party services.\n- **NTLM relay attacks:** An attacker can perform an NTLM relay attack without cracking the credential to gain access to other network-accessible machines.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n- **Network:** An unauthenticated attacker can send a crafted request to the Jupyter server containing a malicious file path with a UNC path to the attacker\u2019s server.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n- The attacker needs to be able to send requests to a vulnerable Jupyter server instance running on Windows.\n- The attacker does not need to authenticate to the Jupyter server.\n\n**Additional details from the commit:**\n\n- The fix implemented in commit `79fbf80` restricts `filefind` to only accept relative paths, and explicitly checks to ensure that resolved paths remain within the specified search directories.\n- The fix includes a check using `is_relative_to` (or a fallback for Python < 3.9) to ensure that the resolved path remains within the specified directory.\n- The commit removes support for absolute paths from the `filefind` function.\n- Added a test case to verify the vulnerability is fixed in `test_utils.py`.",

CWE-200 [Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor] is a class-level CWE. The relationship between these is not directly hierarchical but represents a cause-and-effect. The **improper** search path leads to information exposure. I chose CWE-427 as the primary CWE as it directly represents the **root cause** of the vulnerability and is at the base level.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe427[\"CWE-427: Uncontrolled Search Path Element\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe427 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe427 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper** validation of the file path, leading to an uncontrolled search path. This **uncontrolled** path allows an attacker to inject a malicious UNC path. When the server attempts to resolve this path, it leaks the NTLMv2 password hash, resulting in the exposure of sensitive information.\n\nCWE-427 [Uncontrolled Search Path Element] -> CWE-200 [Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor]\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified several candidate CWEs, including CWE-200 [Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor], CWE-427 [Uncontrolled Search Path Element], and CWE-522 [Insufficiently Protected Credentials].\n\nThe final decision was to assign CWE-427 [Uncontrolled Search Path Element] as the primary CWE because the **root cause** lies in the **lack of proper** validation of the file path, allowing an attacker to control the search path. The evidence to support this is: \"the function did not properly validate that the file path was within the allowed directories, especially when dealing with absolute and UNC paths. This allowed a malicious actor to specify a network location in the path.\" This directly aligns with the description of CWE-427 [Uncontrolled Search Path Element], \"The product uses a fixed or controlled search path to find resources, but one or more locations in that path can be under the control of unintended actors.\"\n\nCWE-200 [Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor] is a secondary CWE because it represents the technical impact. The **uncontrolled** search path leads to the exposure of sensitive information. The retriever recommends against using CWE-200 [Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor] as the primary cause. \"CWE-200 is commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error.\"\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-427 [Uncontrolled Search Path Element] is a base-level CWE that accurately represents the weakness.
