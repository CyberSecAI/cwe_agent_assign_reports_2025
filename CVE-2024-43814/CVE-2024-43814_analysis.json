This occurs without encryption, potentially exposing location data if encryption is not explicitly enabled prior to a mission.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- Unencrypted transmission of sensitive information (PLI data).\n- Default behavior of transmitting PLI data without requiring explicit user action to enable encryption.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- Disclosure of user location data to nearby attackers\n- Compromise of confidentiality.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- Adjacent network access (RF) by an attacker within range to receive the unencrypted PLI broadcasts\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- An attacker must be within RF range of the vulnerable device.\n- No authentication or user interaction is required for exploitation.\n- The attacker must have the capability to capture and interpret RF transmissions.",

CWE-201 is a related CWE that addresses the general case of inserting sensitive information into sent data, and can be considered.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    \n    cwe319 -->|PEEROF| cwe201\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe319 primary\n    class cwe201 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain involves the default behavior of the goTenna plugin leading to unencrypted transmission of location data.\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** Default setting to **share Automatic Position, Location, and Information (PLI) updates** without encryption.\n2.  **Weakness:** **Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information** (CWE-319).\n3.  **Impact:** Disclosure of user location data, compromising confidentiality.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis indicates that the primary vulnerability is due to the **transmission of sensitive information in cleartext** (CWE-319) by default in the goTenna Pro ATAK Plugin. This occurs because the plugin is configured to **share Automatic Position, Location, and Information (PLI) updates** every 60 seconds without encryption being enabled. An attacker within RF range can intercept and interpret these unencrypted transmissions, leading to the disclosure of user location data.\n\nThe evidence to support this assessment comes from the provided vulnerability description and CVE reference summary, which explicitly mention the default behavior of sharing PLI updates without encryption.\n\nThe selection of CWE-319 is based on its direct relevance to the vulnerability description, which states that the plugin transmits location data unencrypted. The retriever results also support this selection, with CWE-319 listed as a relevant CWE. The mapping guidance for CWE-319 allows its use.\n\nI considered CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data) since sensitive information is being sent; however, the more specific CWE-319 is more appropriate because it explicitly addresses the cleartext transmission aspect.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-941: Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**:
