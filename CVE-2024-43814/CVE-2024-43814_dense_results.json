  "query": "The goTenna Pro ATAK Plugins default settings are to share Automatic Position, Location, and Information (PLI) updates every 60 seconds once the plugin is active and goTenna is connected. Users that are unaware of their settings and have not activated encryption before a mission may accidentally broadcast their location unencrypted. It is advised to verify PLI settings are the desired rate and activate encryption prior to mission. Update to the latest Plugin to disable this default setting.",
