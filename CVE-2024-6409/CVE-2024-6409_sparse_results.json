  "query": "A race condition vulnerability was discovered in how signals are handled by OpenSSHs server (sshd). If a remote attacker does not authenticate within a set time period, then sshds SIGALRM handler is called asynchronously. However, this signal handler calls various functions that are not async-signal-safe, for example, syslog(). As a consequence of a successful attack, in the worst case scenario, an attacker may be able to perform a remote code execution (RCE) as an unprivileged user running the sshd server.",
