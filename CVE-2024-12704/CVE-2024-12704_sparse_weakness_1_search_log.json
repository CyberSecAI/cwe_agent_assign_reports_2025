  "query": "A vulnerability in the LangChainLLM class of the run-llama/llama_index repository, version v0.12.5, allows for a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. The stream_complete method executes the llm using a thread and retrieves the result via the get_response_gen method of the StreamingGeneratorCallbackHandler class. If the thread terminates abnormally before the _llm.predict is executed, there is no exception handling for this case, leading to an infinite loop in the get_response_gen function. This can be triggered by providing an input of an incorrect type, causing the thread to terminate and the process to continue running indefinitely.",
