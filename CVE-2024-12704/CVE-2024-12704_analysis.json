  "description": "A vulnerability in the LangChainLLM class of the run-llama/llama_index repository, version v0.12.5, allows for a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. The stream_complete method executes the llm using a thread and retrieves the result via the get_response_gen method of the StreamingGeneratorCallbackHandler class. If the thread terminates abnormally before the _llm.predict is executed, there is no exception handling for this case, leading to an **infinite loop** in the get_response_gen function. This can be triggered by providing an input of an incorrect type, causing the thread to terminate and the process to continue running indefinitely.",

  "reference_content": "The content relates to CVE-2024-12704.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability is due to the lack of a timeout mechanism in the Langchain callback handler. This can lead to indefinite blocking when waiting for a response.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- Lack of timeout in response generation.\n- Potential for indefinite blocking.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- The application may become unresponsive if the response generation takes too long.\n- Potential denial of service.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- An attacker could potentially trigger a slow or non-responsive LLM, causing the application to hang.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- Ability to interact with the application using the LLM.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n- A timeout has been added to the Langchain callback handler to prevent indefinite blocking. The timeout is set to 120 seconds by default.\n\n```\ndiff --git a/llama-index-core/llama_index/core/langchain_helpers/streaming.py b/llama-index-core/llama_index/core/langchain_helpers/streaming.py\nindex 6e62719..d1ecfb7 100644\n--- a/llama-index-core/llama_index/core/langchain_helpers/streaming.py\n+++ b/llama-index-core/llama_index/core/langchain_helpers/streaming.py\n@@ -1,3 +1,4 @@\n from queue import Queue\n from threading import Event\n+import time\n from typing import Any, Generator, List, Optional\n \n@@ -35,10 +36,25 @@ def on_llm_error(\n ) -> None:\n     self._done.set()\n \n- def get_response_gen(self) -> Generator:\n+ def get_response_gen(self, timeout: float = 120.0) -> Generator:\n+     \"\"\"Get response generator with timeout.\n+ \n+     Args:\n+         timeout (float): Maximum time in seconds to wait for the complete response.\n+         Defaults to 120 seconds.\n+     \"\"\"\n+     start_time = time.time()\n+     while True:\n+         if time.time() - start_time > timeout:\n+             raise TimeoutError(\n+                 f\"Response generation timed out after {timeout} seconds\"\n+             )\n+         if not self._token_queue.empty():\n+             token = self._token_queue.get_nowait()\n+             yield token\n+         elif self._done.is_set():\n+             break\n+         else:\n+             # Small sleep to prevent CPU spinning\n+             time.sleep(0.01)\n \n- # TODO: add a timeout to this\n- # while True:\n- # if not self._token_queue.empty():\n- # token = self._token_queue.get_nowait()\n- # yield token\n- # elif self._done.is_set():\n- # break\n- # else:\n- # time.sleep(0.1)\n```\nThis content provides more detail than the official CVE description.",
