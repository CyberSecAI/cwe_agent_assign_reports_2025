## Analysis of CVE-2025-4226 Content

The provided content **RELATES** to a SQL injection vulnerability in phpgurukul Cyber Cafe Management System Project V1.0. It provides significantly more detail than a typical CVE description would.

Here's a breakdown of the extracted information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation and sanitization of user input for the "compname" parameter in the `/add-computer.php` file.  Malicious code can be injected via this parameter and directly used in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   SQL Injection

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Unauthorized database access
*   Sensitive data leakage
*   Data tampering/modification
*   Potential for complete system control
*   Disruption of services

**Attack vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is exploitable via a POST request to `/add-computer.php` with a malicious payload in the "compname" parameter.
*   No login or authorization is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint. No authentication is required.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   **Employ prepared statements and parameter binding:** This separates SQL code from user input.
*   **Conduct input validation and filtering:**  Ensure user input conforms to expected formats.
*   **Minimize database user permissions:** Use accounts with the least necessary privileges.

**Vulnerability details and POC:**

*   **Vulnerable location:** "compname" parameter
*   **Payload Example:** `compname=1' AND SLEEP(5) AND 'BSST'='BSST`
*   **Vulnerability Request Packet:** (Full HTTP POST request provided)
*   **Tool Used for Verification:** sqlmap (screenshots provided showing database enumeration)
