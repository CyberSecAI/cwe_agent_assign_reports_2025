  "description": "The ZOO-Project is an open source processing platform, released under MIT/X11 Licence. A vulnerability in ZOO-Projects WPS (Web Processing Service) implementation allows unauthorized access to files outside the intended directory through **path traversal**. Specifically, the Gdal_Translate service, when processing VRT (Virtual Format) files, **does not properly validate file paths** referenced in the VRTRasterBand element, allowing attackers to read arbitrary files on the system. The vulnerability exists because the service doesnt properly sanitize the SourceFilename parameter in VRT files, allowing relative **path traversal** sequences (../). When combined with VRTs raw data handling capabilities, this allows reading arbitrary files as raw binary data and converting them to TIFF format, effectively exposing their contents. This vulnerability is particularly severe because it allows attackers to read sensitive system files, potentially exposing configuration data, credentials, or other confidential information stored on the server. An unauthenticated attacker can read arbitrary files from the system through **path traversal**, potentially accessing sensitive information such as configuration files, credentials, or other confidential data stored on the server. The vulnerability requires no authentication and can be exploited remotely through the WPS service. This issue has been addressed in commit `5f155a8` and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",

The vulnerability lies in the **improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory**, which allows **path traversal**. |\n| CWE-73 | External Control of File Name or Path | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate. The file path is influenced by external input. |\n| CWE-20 | Improper Input Validation | 0.5 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary Candidate. The root cause is due to a **lack of proper input validation** for file paths. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-22, which is a **Base** level CWE. CWE-22 has parent-child relationships to CWE-36 (Absolute Path Traversal) and CWE-23 (Relative Path Traversal). The vulnerability specifically mentions relative **path traversal** sequences (`../`), making CWE-22 the most accurate **Base** level representation of the vulnerability. CWE-73 (External Control of File Name or Path) is considered as it can precede CWE-22, indicating that external input influences the file path. CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) is a broader **Class** level CWE, and while applicable, CWE-22 provides a more specific classification of the **weakness**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\"]\n    cwe73[\"CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe23[\"CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\"]\n    cwe36[\"CWE-36: Absolute Path Traversal\"]\n\n    cwe22 -->|PARENTOF| cwe23\n    cwe22 -->|PARENTOF| cwe36\n    cwe73 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe22\n    cwe22 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe20\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe22 primary\n    class cwe73,cwe20,cwe23, cwe36 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **external control of the file path**, leading to **improper limitation of the pathname**, and ultimately resulting in the ability to **read arbitrary files**.\n\nExternal Control of File Name or Path (CWE-73) -> Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') (CWE-22) -> Arbitrary File Read\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-22 as the most relevant due to the clear evidence of **path traversal** via unsanitized file paths. The **root cause** is the **failure to properly validate file paths** in VRT files, which allows attackers to use relative **path traversal** sequences. The retriever results strongly support CWE-22, as do the vulnerability description key phrases.\n\nThe graph relationships and the retriever results influenced the final selection by confirming the direct link between **external control of the file path** and **path traversal**. CWE-22 is selected because it's the most specific **Base** level CWE that accurately describes the **weakness**. The evidence provided in the vulnerability description, especially the use of `../` sequences, strongly supports this classification.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
