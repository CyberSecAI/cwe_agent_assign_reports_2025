There is also a chain relationship where a weak hash algorithm (CWE-916) can be caused by insufficient entropy (CWE-331).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe331[\"CWE-331: Insufficient Entropy\"]\n    cwe330[\"CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\"]\n    cwe916[\"CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort\"]\n\n    cwe331 -->|CHILDOF| cwe330\n    cwe331 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe916\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe331 primary\n    class cwe330,cwe916 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **insufficient E2EE password entropy** (CWE-331), which can lead to a **weak password hash** (CWE-916). This ultimately allows attackers to **crack E2EE passwords**. The root cause is CWE-331, and the impact involves potentially CWE-916.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary assessment is based on the provided evidence, which clearly states that the **rootcause** is **insufficient E2EE password entropy**.\n\nThe vulnerability description key phrases explicitly mention **insufficient E2EE password entropy** as the **rootcause**. This aligns directly with CWE-331 (Insufficient Entropy). The description also mentions that this allows attackers to crack the E2EE password, implying a weakness in the password generation or hashing mechanism which could relate to CWE-916 (Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort), although the description does not explicitly state there is a weak password hash used only the **rootcause** of insufficient entropy.\n\nThe graph relationships show that CWE-331 is a child of CWE-330 (Use of Insufficiently Random Values), making it a more specific classification. It also shows that CWE-331 can precede CWE-916, implying a potential chain of weaknesses.\n\nCWE-331 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the root cause identified in the vulnerability description.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-331: Insufficient Entropy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an algorithm or scheme that produces **insufficient entropy**, leaving patterns or clusters of values that are more likely to occur than others.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.66\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.66\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.66\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
