  "description": "A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, has been found in Codezips Free Exam Hall Seating Management System 1.0. This issue affects some unknown processing of the file /pages/save_user.php. The manipulation of the argument image leads to **unrestricted upload**. The attack may be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The initial researcher disclosure contains confusing vulnerability classes and file names.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-10766 (based on the content, the provided CVE description is just a placeholder, so the analysis is based on the information present in the content)\n\n**Root Cause:**\n- The vulnerability stems from the direct usage of the `$_FILES` input in the `/pages/save_user.php` file to determine the storage location of uploaded files, without any input validation or sanitization. Specifically, the code snippet is vulnerable in line 19 of the file.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Unrestricted File Upload:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of any restrictions on the type, size, or content of uploaded files. This lack of validation allows an attacker to upload arbitrary files to the server.\n- **Missing Input Sanitization:** The file path and filename are not sanitized or validated before being used to store the uploaded file.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **File Overwrite:** Attackers can overwrite existing files on the server.\n- **File Injection:** Malicious files, such as PHP scripts, can be uploaded and potentially executed.\n- **Directory Traversal:** The lack of sanitization can lead to directory traversal attacks, where an attacker can upload files outside the intended directory.\n- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Uploading large or malicious files could cause a denial of service.\n- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading and executing malicious code, an attacker can achieve remote code execution on the server.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through the web interface by uploading files to `/pages/save_user.php`.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- The attacker needs to have the ability to access the web interface and initiate file upload requests. No special privileges or access is mentioned, indicating a standard user role may be sufficient.\n\n**Additional Notes**\n- The provided images within the content are just proof of concept (POC) screenshots and code execution. They don't provide additional vulnerability details, but illustrate the ease of exploitation.\n- The analysis is based on the identified vulnerable file `/pages/save_user.php`, which was initially mistakenly reported as `/update-image1.php`.\n- The identified vulnerable product is the \"Codezips Free Exam Hall Seating Management System In PHP with Source Code 1.0.\"",
