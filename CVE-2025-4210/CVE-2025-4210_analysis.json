  "description": "A vulnerability classified as critical was found in Casdoor up to 1.811.0. This vulnerability affects the function HandleScim of the file controllers/scim.go of the component SCIM User Creation Endpoint. The manipulation leads to **authorization bypass**. The attack can be initiated remotely. Upgrading to version 1.812.0 is able to address this issue. The name of the patch is 3d12ac8dc2282369296c3386815c00a06c6a92fe. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component.",

The vulnerability results in an **authorization bypass**, indicating a failure in access control. |\n| CWE-639 | Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary candidate. The vulnerability involves the manipulation of the SCIM user creation endpoint, potentially through user-controlled keys. |\n| CWE-306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | 0.4 | Base | Allowed | Secondary candidate. Considered because an **authorization bypass** might imply a lack of authentication. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship influencing the CWE selection is the hierarchical relationship between CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) and its child CWEs like CWE-285 (Improper Authorization), CWE-862 (Missing Authorization), and CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization). Since the description indicates an **authorization bypass** without specifying the exact mechanism, CWE-284 is selected as the high-level classification. CWE-639 is considered as a possible cause, based on the retriever results and the vulnerability description, but there is not enough information to confirm that this is the root cause. CWE-306 is also considered because **authorization bypass** could also be caused by missing authentication, although that is less specific.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    \n    cwe639 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe284 primary\n    class cwe639,cwe306 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a flaw in the `HandleScim` function of the `controllers/scim.go` file, leading to an **authorization bypass**.\n\nFlaw in `HandleScim` -> **Authorization Bypass** -> Unauthorized Access\n\nThe description does not provide specific details on the root cause, so the chain ends with the impact.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on identifying the most appropriate CWE based on the provided vulnerability description. The key phrase \"**authorization bypass**\" strongly suggests a problem with access control. The retriever results and the CWE guidance reinforced the selection of CWE-284 as the primary CWE, given its broad scope encompassing various access control failures.\n\nThe assessment is based primarily on the provided evidence, specifically the vulnerability description indicating an **authorization bypass** in the SCIM user creation endpoint. The description states: \"The manipulation leads to **authorization bypass**.\"\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the final selection by highlighting the hierarchical structure of CWEs related to access control. CWE-284 was chosen as the primary CWE due to its generality, while CWE-639 was considered as a possible cause, although there is not enough information to confirm that this is the root cause. CWE-306 was also considered because **authorization bypass** could also be caused by missing authentication, although that is less specific.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at an appropriate level of specificity, given the available information.
