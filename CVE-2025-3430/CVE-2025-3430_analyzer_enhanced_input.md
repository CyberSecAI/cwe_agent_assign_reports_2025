## Vulnerability Description
The 3DPrint Lite plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the printer_text parameter in all versions up to, and including, 2.1.3.6 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**
- **weakness:** **SQL injection**
- **impact:** extract sensitive information from the database
- **attacker:** unauthenticated attackers
- **product:** 3DPrint Lite plugin for WordPress
- **version:** all versions up to and including 2.1.3.6
- **component:** printer_text parameter

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, this relates to CVE-2025-3430 as it describes a "Security fix" included in changesets for the 3dprint-lite WordPress plugin. The content provides more detail than a standard CVE description.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

* **Root cause of vulnerability:** Not explicitly stated, but the changesets indicate a security issue was addressed.
* **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The changes involve adding nonce verification to several admin functions: `clone` and `add` actions for printers, materials, coatings, and infills. This suggests a potential vulnerability related to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) or unauthorized modification of data.
* **Impact of exploitation:**  Without more details, the impact is unclear, but could involve unauthorized creation, modification, or deletion of printer, material, coating, or infill data within the plugin.
* **Attack vectors:** Likely through crafted HTTP requests that bypass access controls.
* **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to be able to craft and send HTTP requests to the WordPress site, potentially requiring some level of authentication (depending on the specific vulnerable function).
* **Mitigation or fix:** The fix involves adding `wp_verify_nonce` checks to the `clone` and `add` actions in the admin interface. This ensures that requests are legitimate and originate from the expected source.

**Specific changes observed:**

*   **Addition of Nonce Verification:** The code was modified to include `wp_verify_nonce` checks before performing actions like cloning or adding printers, materials, coatings, and infills. This is a standard WordPress security practice to prevent CSRF attacks.
*   **Version Update:** The plugin version was updated from 2.1.3.5 to 2.1.3.6.
*   **readme.txt update:** The changelog was updated to reflect the "Security fix" included in version 2.1.3.6.
