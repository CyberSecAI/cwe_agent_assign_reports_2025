## Vulnerability Description
IrfanView DXF File Parsing Out-Of-Bounds Read Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of IrfanView. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of DXF files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-24873.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing DXF files in IrfanView. Specifically, the program reads past the end of an allocated buffer.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists due to insufficient input validation when processing DXF files.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A successful exploit allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current IrfanView process. This could lead to complete system compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.

*   **Attack Vectors:** The primary attack vector involves a user opening a malicious DXF file or visiting a malicious webpage that triggers the parsing of a specially crafted DXF file.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious DXF file to the user or entice the user to visit a webpage hosting a malicious DXF file, which then needs to be processed by a vulnerable version of IrfanView. User interaction is required.

*   **Additional Information:** The vulnerability is fixed in IrfanView version 4.70 with plugins version 4.70.
