    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'potential NULL pointer dereference'

Relevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:

### 1. CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference (Score: 486.24)

The product dereferences a pointer that it expects to be valid but is NULL....

### 2. CWE-252: Unchecked Return Value (Score: 424.27)

The product does not check the return value from a method or function, which can prevent it from detecting unexpected states and conditions....

### 3. CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer (Score: 387.62)

The product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized....

### 4. CWE-665: Improper Initialization (Score: 383.34)

The product does not initialize or incorrectly initializes a resource, which might leave the resource in an unexpected state when it is accessed or used....

### 5. CWE-690: Unchecked Return Value to NULL Pointer Dereference (Score: 382.69)

The product does not check for an error after calling a function that can return with a NULL pointer if the function fails, which leads to a resultant NULL pointer dereference....
