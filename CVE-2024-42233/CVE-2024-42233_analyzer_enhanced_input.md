## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved filemap replace pte_offset_map() with pte_offset_map_nolock() The vmf->ptl in filemap_fault_recheck_pte_none() is still set from handle_pte_fault(). But at the same time, we did a pte_unmap(vmf->pte). After a pte_unmap(vmf->pte) unmap and rcu_read_unlock(), the page table may be racily changed and vmf->ptl maybe fails to protect the actual page table. Fix this by replacing pte_offset_map() with pte_offset_map_nolock(). As David said, the PTL pointer might be stale so if we continue to use it infilemap_fault_recheck_pte_none(), it might trigger UAF. Also, if the PTL fails, the issue fixed by commit 58f327f2ce80 (filemap avoid unnecessary major faults in filemap_fault()) might reappear.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **use of stale PTL pointer**
- **impact:** UAF and memory corruption
- **product:** Linux kernel
- **component:** filemap

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from a race condition in the `filemap_fault_recheck_pte_none` function within the Linux kernel's memory management subsystem.
- The `vmf->ptl` (page table lock) is set in `handle_pte_fault()`, but a subsequent `pte_unmap(vmf->pte)` call and an `rcu_read_unlock()` operation can allow the page table to be changed concurrently.
- This race condition can lead to a stale `vmf->ptl` pointer, causing a use-after-free (UAF) vulnerability if the code continues to use it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Race Condition:** The core issue is the lack of proper synchronization when accessing the page table after unmapping a PTE and releasing an RCU read lock, where the PTE can be changed by another thread or process.
- **Use-After-Free (UAF):**  The stale `vmf->ptl` pointer could be dereferenced after the memory it points to has been freed or reallocated.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Use-After-Free:** If exploited, this UAF vulnerability could lead to:
    - **Kernel Crash:** Dereferencing freed memory can cause the kernel to crash.
    - **Arbitrary Code Execution:** In some cases, a carefully crafted exploit could potentially achieve arbitrary code execution in the kernel context.
- **Reappearance of Previously Fixed Issue:** The commit also mentions that if the PTL fails, a previous issue related to unnecessary major faults might reappear. This would be a denial-of-service type impact.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The vulnerability exists within the kernel's memory management routines, meaning an attacker needs to trigger a specific sequence of memory operations through the file system to reach the vulnerable code path.
- The attack would require a process to generate a page fault, followed by a race with other threads or processes that may modify the page table, specifically in cases where `filemap_fault_recheck_pte_none()` is invoked.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local Access:** An attacker would likely need local access to the system to trigger the specific conditions needed for the vulnerability to be exploitable. 
- **Ability to Trigger Page Faults:** An attacker would need to trigger page faults to reach the vulnerable code path.
- **Timing:** Success depends on winning the race condition to cause a stale pointer usage, which may require some control over process scheduling or memory management operations.
