But at the same time, we did a pte_unmap(vmf->pte). After a pte_unmap(vmf->pte) unmap and rcu_read_unlock(), the page table may be racily changed and vmf->ptl maybe fails to protect the actual page table. Fix this by replacing pte_offset_map() with pte_offset_map_nolock(). As David said, the PTL pointer might be stale so if we continue to use it infilemap_fault_recheck_pte_none(), it might trigger UAF. Also, if the PTL fails, the issue fixed by commit 58f327f2ce80 (filemap avoid unnecessary major faults in filemap_fault()) might reappear.
