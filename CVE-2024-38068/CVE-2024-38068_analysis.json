While it is generally preferable to select a Base or Variant level CWE, the available information does not point to a more specific weakness. The relationship to other CWEs is not particularly relevant in this case due to the lack of detailed information.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe400 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the OCSP server and leads to a denial of service. The **uncontrolled resource consumption** is the main weakness.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description indicates a denial-of-service vulnerability in the Windows Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) Server. The primary weakness is that the server consumes resources in an **uncontrolled** manner, leading to a denial of service. The retriever results suggest CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) as a relevant candidate, along with other certificate-related CWEs.\n\nGiven the limited information and the retriever results, CWE-400 seems to be the most appropriate choice. The \"CWE for similar CVE Descriptions\" gives CWE-NVD-noinfo which indicates there is not enough information. While ideally, a more specific Base or Variant CWE would be preferred, the provided evidence is insufficient to pinpoint a more precise root cause. Therefore, CWE-400 is selected as the primary CWE, even though it's a Class.\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-297: Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product communicates with a host that provides a certificate, but the product does not properly ensure that the certificate is actually associated with that host.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-617: Reachable Assertion\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains an assert() or similar statement that can be triggered by an attacker, which leads to an application exit or other behavior that is more severe than necessary.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not validate, or incorrectly validates, a certificate.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
