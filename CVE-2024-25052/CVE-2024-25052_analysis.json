CWE-522 [Insufficiently Protected Credentials] and CWE-256 [Plaintext Storage of a Password] are related. CWE-256 is a child of CWE-522, indicating a more specific case of storing credentials. The chosen CWE, CWE-312, directly addresses the vulnerability described.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    cwe256[\"CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\"]\n\n    cwe256 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe312 primary\n    class cwe522,cwe256 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper storage of sensitive data** in cleartext (CWE-312). This leads to the impact of an admin user being able to read user credentials. The chain is direct:\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** CWE-312 [Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information] - Sensitive data is stored in cleartext.\n2.  **Impact:** Unauthorized Access - An admin user can read the stored credentials.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-312 [Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information] as the primary candidate based on the **rootcause** being the **improper storage of sensitive data** in cleartext. The vulnerability description states that \"IBM Jazz Reporting Service 7.0.3 stores user credentials in plain clear text which can be read by an admin user.\" This directly aligns with CWE-312, which describes storing sensitive information in cleartext.\n\nThe retriever results also suggest CWE-522 [Insufficiently Protected Credentials] and CWE-256 [Plaintext Storage of a Password]. However, CWE-312 is a more direct representation of the **weakness**, as it focuses on the storage aspect rather than the broader concept of credential protection. CWE-256 is more specific than CWE-312, but because the description doesn't specifically mention that the cleartext is only passwords, it is safer to pick the broader CWE-312.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the decision by highlighting the relationship between CWE-522 and CWE-256, but ultimately, CWE-312 was chosen for its direct relevance to the vulnerability description and its appropriate level of specificity.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
