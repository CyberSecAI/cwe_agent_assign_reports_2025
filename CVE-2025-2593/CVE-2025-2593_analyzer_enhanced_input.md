## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability has been found in FastCMS up to 0.1.5 and classified as critical. Affected by this vulnerability is an unknown functionality of the file /api/client/article/list. The manipulation of the argument orderBy leads to **sql injection**. The attack can be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **sql injection**
- **vector:** manipulation of orderBy argument
- **product:** FastCMS
- **version:** up to 0.1.5
- **component:** /api/client/article/list

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## CVE-2025-2593 Analysis

The provided content details two SQL injection vulnerabilities in the `fastcms` application, version 0.1.5. Both issues relate to the `/client/article/list` interface (and a related `/client/article/list/open` interface).

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of proper validation and sanitization of the `orderBy` parameter in the `/client/article/list` and `/client/article/list/open` interfaces. This parameter is used in a dynamic SQL query segment (`${ew.customSqlSegment}`) within the `ArticleMapper.xml` file, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   SQL Injection (specifically, time-based blind SQL injection)
*   Insufficient input validation
*   Use of dynamic SQL without proper sanitization

**Impact of exploitation:**

Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to:

*   Read sensitive data from the database.
*   Modify data in the database.
*   Potentially execute arbitrary commands on the database server (depending on database permissions).

**Attack vectors:**

*   An attacker can craft a malicious HTTP GET request to `/fastcms/api/client/article/list` or `/fastcms/api/client/article/list/open`, including a crafted `orderBy` parameter.
*   The attacker needs a valid user account with authorization to access the interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   Authenticated user (regular account is sufficient)
*   Ability to craft HTTP requests.
*   Understanding of SQL injection techniques.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   Implement robust input validation and sanitization for the `orderBy` parameter.
*   Avoid using dynamic SQL segments with user-controlled input.
*   Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
*   Apply the principle of least privilege to database user accounts.

**Details beyond the official CVE description (as a placeholder):**

The provided content offers significantly more detail than a typical CVE description. It includes:

*   Specific vulnerable endpoints (`/client/article/list`, `/client/article/list/open`).
*   Detailed proof-of-concept examples, including HTTP request examples and explanations of how to exploit the vulnerability (using `sleep()` for time-based blind injection).
*   Code locations (`com.fastcms.cms.controller.api.ArticleApi#list`, `com.fastcms.cms.controller.api.ArticleApi#listOpen`, `src/main/resources/mapper/ArticleMapper.xml`).
*   Specific code analysis pointing to the vulnerable dynamic SQL segment.
*   Affected product information (vendor, repository links, version).
*   Vulnerability author information.
