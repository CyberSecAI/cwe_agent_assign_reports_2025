## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability classified as problematic was found in JeecgBoot up to 3.8.0. This vulnerability affects the function unzipFile of the file /jeecg-boot/airag/knowledge/doc/import/zip of the component Document Library Upload. The manipulation of the argument File leads to resource consumption. The attack can be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** resource consumption
- **product:** JeecgBoot
- **version:** up to 3.8.0
- **component:** Document Library Upload

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
**CVE: CVE-2025-4533** (PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval)

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `org.jeecg.modules.airag.llm.service.impl.AiragKnowledgeDocServiceImpl#unzipFile` method. It only restricts ZIP path traversal but does not limit the total size or the number of files after decompression.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Zip Bomb vulnerability. Lack of size and file count validation during ZIP file decompression.
*   **Impact of exploitation:**  System resources (disk space) can be heavily consumed, leading to service unavailability.
*   **Attack vectors:** Uploading a specially crafted ZIP file ("zblg.zip" in the example) that, when decompressed, expands to a very large size (approximately 281TB from a 10MB file). The attack is performed through the document library upload functionality: `后台-->AI大模型-->AI知识库-->文档库上传`.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to upload files to the "AI Knowledge Base" document library.
*   **Mitigation or fix:**
    *   Limit the total size of decompressed files.
    *   Limit the directory recursion depth during decompression.
    *   Monitor for abnormal compression ratios.
    *   Reject files with excessively high compression ratios or large sizes.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content details a specific vulnerability in JeecgBoot version 3.8.0.
*   The content provides more detail than a typical CVE description, including the specific code location and a detailed reproduction scenario.
*   The issue is already closed on GitHub.
