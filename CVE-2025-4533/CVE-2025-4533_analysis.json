  "reference_content": "**CVE: CVE-2025-4533** (PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval)\n\n**Vulnerability Details:**\n\n*   **Root cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `org.jeecg.modules.airag.llm.service.impl.AiragKnowledgeDocServiceImpl#unzipFile` method. It only restricts ZIP path traversal but does not limit the total size or the number of files after decompression.\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Zip Bomb vulnerability. Lack of size and file count validation during ZIP file decompression.\n*   **Impact of exploitation:**  System resources (disk space) can be heavily consumed, leading to service unavailability.\n*   **Attack vectors:** Uploading a specially crafted ZIP file (\"zblg.zip\" in the example) that, when decompressed, expands to a very large size (approximately 281TB from a 10MB file). The attack is performed through the document library upload functionality: `\u540e\u53f0-->AI\u5927\u6a21\u578b-->AI\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93-->\u6587\u6863\u5e93\u4e0a\u4f20`.\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to upload files to the \"AI Knowledge Base\" document library.\n*   **Mitigation or fix:**\n    *   Limit the total size of decompressed files.\n    *   Limit the directory recursion depth during decompression.\n    *   Monitor for abnormal compression ratios.\n    *   Reject files with excessively high compression ratios or large sizes.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n*   The provided content details a specific vulnerability in JeecgBoot version 3.8.0.\n*   The content provides more detail than a typical CVE description, including the specific code location and a detailed reproduction scenario.\n*   The issue is already closed on GitHub.",

The vulnerability clearly involves resource consumption (**impact: resource consumption**), specifically the uncontrolled allocation of disk space during ZIP file decompression, making CWE-770 a relevant refinement of CWE-400.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    \n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe400 primary\n    class cwe770 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of** proper validation during ZIP file decompression. This leads to **uncontrolled resource consumption** due to the Zip Bomb attack. The sequence is as follows:\n\n1.  **Missing** size and file count validation during ZIP decompression.\n2.  **Uncontrolled** allocation of disk space.\n3.  System resource exhaustion and service unavailability.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis considered the Retriever Results and other CWE candidates, but the final decision was driven by the **root cause** identified in the CVE description: the **lack of size and file count validation** which leads to **uncontrolled resource consumption**.\n\nThe primary CWE, CWE-400, is a high-level classification. However, CWE-770 provides a more specific characterization of the vulnerability by highlighting the **allocation of resources without limits or throttling**, directly addressing the **root cause** of the resource exhaustion. The evidence from the CVE summary specifically states that the `unzipFile` method \"only restricts ZIP path traversal but does not limit the total size or the number of files after decompression.\" This directly implies that resources are being allocated without proper limits, making CWE-770 a strong secondary candidate to describe the vulnerability in detail.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
