Go to \"Settings > Ultimate Noindex\".\n2.  Add the payload `</textarea><script>alert(/XSS: unn_noindex_pages/)</script>` to the first textarea.\n3.  Click \"Update Options\".\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\nHigh privilege user (e.g., admin). The vulnerability can be exploited even when the `unfiltered_html` capability is disallowed, such as in a multisite setup.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\nFixed in version 1.3.6.\n\n**Additional details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   **Classification:** Type: XSS, OWASP top 10: A7: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), CWE: CWE-79, CVSS: 3.5 (low).\n*   **Researcher:** Bob Matyas\n*   **Timeline:** Publicly Published: 2024-02-03, Added: 2024-03-25, Last Updated: 2024-03-25.\n*   **WPVDB ID:** 6d101f2b-e903-4e64-92cc-e550abb52d6f.",

The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings, allowing high privilege users to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-79, which is a base-level CWE. There are parent CWEs such as CWE-116 (Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output) and CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')). However, CWE-79 directly addresses the Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability, making it the most specific and appropriate choice.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe116[\"CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    \n    cwe79 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe116 -->|PARENT| cwe79\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe79 primary\n    class cwe116,cwe74 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **failure to sanitize and escape settings**, leading to the **Stored Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability**. The root cause is the **improper neutralization of input**, and the impact is the ability for high privilege users to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary. The evidence clearly points to CWE-79 as the most appropriate classification because the plugin **does not sanitize and escape some of its settings**, leading directly to a **Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability**. The selection of CWE-79 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it accurately represents the weakness described.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
