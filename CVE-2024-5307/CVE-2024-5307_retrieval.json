This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Kofax Power PDF. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the handling of Annotation objects in AcroForms. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-22933.', key_phrases={'rootcause': 'lack of proper validation of user-supplied data', 'weakness': ['Information Disclosure Vulnerability', 'Out-Of-Bounds Read'], 'impact': ['disclose sensitive information', 'execute arbitrary code', 'information disclosure'], 'vector': 'malicious page or file', 'attacker': 'remote attackers', 'product': 'Kofax Power PDF', 'version': '', 'component': 'AcroForms'}, reference_content=\"Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\\n\\n**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when handling Annotation objects within AcroForms in Kofax Power PDF. This lack of validation leads to a read operation that goes beyond the boundaries of an allocated buffer.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\\n*   **Out-of-bounds read:** The primary weakness is the ability to read memory outside of the allocated buffer for Annotation objects. This is a classic memory corruption issue.\\n\\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\\n*   **Information disclosure:** An attacker can potentially gain access to sensitive information stored in the memory region past the intended buffer.\\n*   **Potential for arbitrary code execution:** The advisory mentions that this vulnerability can be leveraged in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process. This is not directly caused by this vulnerability but is an amplification path when chained.\\n\\n**Attack Vectors:**\\n*   **Malicious file:** The vulnerability can be triggered by opening a specially crafted malicious PDF file.\\n*   **Malicious page:** The vulnerability can also be exploited by visiting a malicious webpage which uses the vulnerable functionality of the application.\\n*   **User Interaction Required**: Exploitation requires user interaction, as the user must open a malicious file or visit a malicious page.\\n\\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\\n*   **Remote attacker:** The attacker can be remote, meaning they do not need direct access to the victim's machine.\\n*   **Ability to create malicious files/pages:** The attacker must have the ability to create a specially crafted PDF file or a malicious webpage with data that triggers the out-of-bounds read condition.\\n*   **No special privileges:** The attacker does not need any special privileges on the victim's system to exploit this vulnerability. They only need to convince the user to open a malicious file or visit a malicious page.\", similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {95: {'cwe_counts': defaultdict(<class 'int'>, {}), 'total_samples': 5,

    "enhanced_query": "# Vulnerability Description\n\n    Kofax Power PDF AcroForm Annotation **Out-Of-Bounds Read** **Information Disclosure Vulnerability**. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Kofax Power PDF. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the handling of Annotation objects in AcroForms. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-22933.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'lack of proper validation of user-supplied data'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1.
