  "description": "Kofax Power PDF AcroForm Annotation **Out-Of-Bounds Read** **Information Disclosure Vulnerability**. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Kofax Power PDF. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the handling of Annotation objects in AcroForms. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-22933.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when handling Annotation objects within AcroForms in Kofax Power PDF. This lack of validation leads to a read operation that goes beyond the boundaries of an allocated buffer.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n*   **Out-of-bounds read:** The primary weakness is the ability to read memory outside of the allocated buffer for Annotation objects. This is a classic memory corruption issue.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n*   **Information disclosure:** An attacker can potentially gain access to sensitive information stored in the memory region past the intended buffer.\n*   **Potential for arbitrary code execution:** The advisory mentions that this vulnerability can be leveraged in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process. This is not directly caused by this vulnerability but is an amplification path when chained.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n*   **Malicious file:** The vulnerability can be triggered by opening a specially crafted malicious PDF file.\n*   **Malicious page:** The vulnerability can also be exploited by visiting a malicious webpage which uses the vulnerable functionality of the application.\n*   **User Interaction Required**: Exploitation requires user interaction, as the user must open a malicious file or visit a malicious page.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n*   **Remote attacker:** The attacker can be remote, meaning they do not need direct access to the victim's machine.\n*   **Ability to create malicious files/pages:** The attacker must have the ability to create a specially crafted PDF file or a malicious webpage with data that triggers the out-of-bounds read condition.\n*   **No special privileges:** The attacker does not need any special privileges on the victim's system to exploit this vulnerability. They only need to convince the user to open a malicious file or visit a malicious page.",

The **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data** (CWE-20) leads to...\n2.  An **Out-Of-Bounds Read** (CWE-125) in the handling of Annotation objects in AcroForms, resulting in...\n3.  Potential **information disclosure** and ability to **execute arbitrary code**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment strongly points to CWE-125 as the primary weakness, given the clear description of an **Out-Of-Bounds Read**. The root cause, identified as **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, maps to CWE-20.\n\nThe vulnerability description explicitly states \"The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer.\" This provides direct evidence for mapping the root cause to CWE-20 and the resulting weakness to CWE-125.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the selection by clarifying the sequence of events: improper input validation (CWE-20) leading to out-of-bounds read (CWE-125). This helped distinguish the root cause from the resulting vulnerability.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-125 being a Base level weakness that accurately describes the **Out-Of-Bounds Read**, and CWE-20 being a Class level weakness that appropriately captures the **Improper Input Validation** root cause.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-788: Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads or writes to a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location after the end of the buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: The CWE entry might be misused when lower-level CWE entries might be available. It also overlaps existing CWE entries and might be deprecated in the future.\n\n*Was considered but not selected because CWE-125 is more specific to the read operation, while CWE-788 covers both read and write.*\n\n## CWE-129: Improper Validation of Array Index\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses untrusted input when calculating or using an array index, but the product does not validate or incorrectly validates the index to ensure the index references a valid position within the array.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Was considered but not selected because the description doesn't mention specifically an array index being the cause.*\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Was considered but not selected because the description doesn't mention a buffer size miscalculation.*\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Was considered but not selected because the vulnerability isn't about bypassing a protection mechanism.*\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n*Was not selected because the vulnerability isn't an injection issue.*\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Was considered but not selected because this CWE is more about a systemic issue of information exposure, rather than a specific vulnerability due to out-of-bounds read.*\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).

It is not useful for trend analysis.\n\n*Was not selected because it's too high-level and less descriptive of the specific vulnerability.*\n\n## CWE-134: Use of Externally-Controlled Format String\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a function that accepts a format string as an argument, but the format string originates from an external source.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Was not selected because the vulnerability isn't related to format string issues.*\n\n## CWE-657: Violation of Secure Design Principles\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product violates well-established principles for secure design.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:",
