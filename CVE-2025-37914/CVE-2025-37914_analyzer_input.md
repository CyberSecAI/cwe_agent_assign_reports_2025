# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-37914

## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved net_sched ets Fix double list add in class with netem as child qdisc As described in Gerrards report [1], there are use cases where a netem child qdisc will make the parent qdiscs enqueue callback reentrant. In the case of ets, there wont be a UAF, but the code will add the same classifier to the list twice, which will cause **memory corruption**. In addition to checking for qlen being zero, this patch checks whether the class was already added to the active_list (cl_is_active) before doing the addition to cater for the reentrant case.
