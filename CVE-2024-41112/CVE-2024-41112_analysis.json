Prior to commit c4f81d9616d40c60584e36abb15300853a66e489, the palette variable in `pages/1__Timelapse.py` takes user input, which is later used in the `eval()` function on line 380, leading to remote code execution.

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-41112:\n\n**Verification:**\n\nThe provided content from `securitylab.github.com` directly references `CVE-2024-41112` and identifies it as `GHSL-2024-100`. The identified vulnerability is a Remote Code Execution (RCE) in `pages/1_\ud83d\udcf7_Timelapse.py` related to the `palette` variable when using the `Any Earth Engine ImageCollection` option. This confirms the content is directly related to the CVE.\n\n**Vulnerability Details:**\n\n*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the use of the `eval()` function on user-provided input within the `palette` variable in `pages/1_\ud83d\udcf7_Timelapse.py`. Specifically, lines 373-376 define a text area for user input of a palette and this input is then evaluated using the `eval()` function.\n*   **Weakness:** The primary weakness is the unsafe use of the `eval()` function. This function executes arbitrary Python code passed to it as a string. Since user input is directly passed to this function, it becomes a prime target for injection attacks.\n*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows for arbitrary code execution on the server running the Streamlit application. An attacker could gain full control over the server, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, and other malicious activities.\n*   **Attack Vector:** The attack vector is through the web interface of the Streamlit application. Specifically, the attacker needs to access the \ud83d\udcf7 Timelapse tab, select the `Any Earth Engine Image Collection` option, enter a valid `ee.ImageCollection` id and then inject malicious python code into the `Enter a custom palette` text area.\n*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to access the Streamlit application's web interface and be able to provide user input to the `palette` variable within the `Any Earth Engine Image Collection` option of the Timelapse tab.\n\n**Technical Details:**\n\nThe vulnerable code snippet from `pages/1_\ud83d\udcf7_Timelapse.py` is:\n\n```python\npalette = st.text_area(\n    \"Enter a custom palette:\",\n    palette_values,\n)\nst.write(\n    cm.plot_colormap(cmap=palette_options, return_fig=True)\n)\nst.session_state[\"palette\"] = eval(palette)\n```\n\nThe Proof of Concept (PoC) provided demonstrates the vulnerability by injecting the following malicious code:\n\n```python\n__import__('code').InteractiveInterpreter().runsource('import os;os.system(\\\"echo $(uname -a) > foobar.txt\\\")')\n```\n\nThis code uses `__import__('code').InteractiveInterpreter().runsource()` to execute the `os.system()` command. This command is used to execute shell commands, creating a text file `foobar.txt` with the output of the `uname -a` command.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\nThe provided github.com content shows the code before and after the fix. The fix replaces the use of `eval()` with `json.loads()`, which prevents the execution of arbitrary code and handles the string as a json object for palette configuration.\n\n```python\nst.session_state[\"palette\"] = json.loads(\n    palette.replace(\"'\", '\"')\n)\n```\n\n**Summary of findings:**\n\n-   **CVE ID:** CVE-2024-41112\n-   **Root Cause:** Unsafe use of `eval()` on user-supplied input in the `palette` variable.\n-   **Vulnerability:** Remote Code Execution.\n-  **Impact:** Complete server compromise\n-   **Attack Vector:** Web interface, requiring access to the Timelapse tab, selection of `Any Earth Engine Image Collection` and a malicious payload in the `Enter a custom palette` text area.\n-   **Attacker Capabilities:** Access to the web interface of the Streamlit application.\n\nThe content from `securitylab.github.com` provides more detail than a typical CVE description, including a clear PoC and the specific line numbers where the vulnerability resides.",

CWE-95 is the most specific and relevant CWE for this vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not Used:* This CWE does not apply because the issue is not related to encoding or escaping, but rather the direct execution of code via `eval()`.\n\n## CWE-1286: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input that is expected to be well-formed - i.e., to comply with a certain syntax - but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input complies with the syntax.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Used:* This is a good candidate, but the `eval()` function is the more specific weakness.\n\n## CWE-95: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes code syntax before using the input in a dynamic evaluation call (e.g. \"eval\").\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Used:* This is the primary CWE for this vulnerability. The vulnerability stems from the use of the `eval()` function on user-provided input.\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Used:* This CWE does not apply because the issue is not related to sensitive information handling.\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not Used:* While input neutralization is relevant, CWE-95 is more specific to the use of `eval()`.\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Used:* This CWE does not apply as there's no evidence of a list of disallowed inputs.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n*Not Used:* CWE-95 is a better and more specific fit.\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Used:* This CWE is not relevant as the vulnerability is about code execution, not information exposure.\n\n## CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product establishes a communication channel to (or from) an endpoint for privileged or protected operations, but it does not properly ensure that it is communicating with the correct endpoint.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not Used:* This CWE is not relevant because there is no communication channel being improperly restricted.\n\n## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n**\n\n\n## CWE Relationship Analysis\n\nCurrent CWEs represent these abstraction levels: .\n\n\n### Vulnerability Chain Analysis\n\n**Chain starting from CWE-116:**\n- 116 (Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output) - ROOT\n\n\n**Chain starting from CWE-94:**\n- 94 (Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')) - ROOT\n\n\n\n### CWE Relationship Diagram\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n```",

Some CMS (Content Management Systems) also use templates.\n\n\nTemplate engines often have their own custom command or expression language. If an attacker can influence input into a template before it is processed, then the attacker can invoke arbitrary expressions, i.e. perform injection attacks. For example, in some template languages, an attacker could inject the expression \"{{7*7}}\" and determine if the output returns \"49\" instead. The syntax varies depending on the language.\n\n\nIn some cases, XSS-style attacks can work, which can obscure the root cause if the developer does not closely investigate the root cause of the error.\n\n\nTemplate engines can be used on the server or client, so both \"sides\" could be affected by injection. The mechanisms of attack or the affected technologies might be different, but the mistake is fundamentally the same.\n",
