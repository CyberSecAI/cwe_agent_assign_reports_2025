# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-8612

## Vulnerability Description
A flaw was found in QEMU, in the virtio-scsi, virtio-blk, and virtio-crypto devices. The size for virtqueue_push as set in virtio_scsi_complete_req / virtio_blk_req_complete / virito_crypto_req_complete could be larger than the true size of the data which has been sent to guest. Once virtqueue_push() finally calls dma_memory_unmap to ummap the in_iov, it may call the address_space_write function to write back the data. Some **uninitialized data** may exist in the bounce.buffer, leading to an information leak.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **uninitialized data**
- **impact:** information leak
- **product:** QEMU
- **component:** virtio-scsi and virtio-blk and virtio-crypto

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-8612:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the QEMU emulator, specifically in the `virtio-scsi`, `virtio-blk`, and `virtio-crypto` devices.
*   The issue stems from the way `virtqueue_push` is used. The size parameter passed to `virtqueue_push` can be larger than the actual data sent to the guest.
*   This occurs in the completion routines: `virtio_scsi_complete_req`, `virtio_blk_req_complete`, and `virito_crypto_req_complete`.
*   When `virtqueue_push` eventually calls `dma_memory_unmap` to unmap the `in_iov`, the system might write back data using the `address_space_write` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Leak:** Due to the size discrepancy, uninitialized data may reside in the `bounce.buffer`. When data is written back, this uninitialized data can be exposed, leading to an information leak.
*   **Incorrect Size Handling**: The core issue is that the size passed to `virtqueue_push` is not properly validated or constrained to match the actual data being processed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can result in the **disclosure of sensitive information** from the host to the guest.
*   The leaked information is potentially sensitive because it comes from uninitialized memory regions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves a malicious or compromised guest operating system interacting with the vulnerable virtio devices (scsi, block, crypto).
*   The guest can trigger the vulnerable code path by performing I/O operations that cause data to be written back to memory via the described flaw.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have control over a guest operating system running on a vulnerable QEMU instance.
*   The attacker must be able to perform I/O operations that interact with the affected virtio devices.
*   The attacker needs to know how to trigger the specific code path in QEMU to cause the size mismatch and information leak.

**Additional Details from Content:**

*   **NetApp:** NetApp acknowledges the vulnerability in multiple products incorporating QEMU.  They classify the severity as LOW with a CVSS score of 3.8. They are investigating the impact on specific products but list many that are not affected.  They state that fixes will be made available through the NetApp Support website, but there are no workarounds provided at this time.
*   **Red Hat Bugzilla:** Red Hat Bugzilla entry confirms the vulnerability as an information leak in `virtio` devices. It references a specific commit in the upstream QEMU project fixing the issue: `https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/commit/637b0aa139565cb82a7b9269e62214f87082635c`.

The information in the bugzilla entry is more detailed than the CVE description since it describes the code paths involved and gives details about the root cause.
