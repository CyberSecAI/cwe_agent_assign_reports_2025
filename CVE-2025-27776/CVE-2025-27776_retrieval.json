  "vulnerability_info": "VulnerabilityInfo(cve_id='CVE-2025-27776', description='Applio is a voice conversion tool. Versions 3.2.7 and prior are vulnerable to **server-side request forgery** (SSRF) and **file write** in `model_download.py` (line 240 in 3.2.7). The **blind SSRF** allows for sending requests on behalf of Applio server and can be leveraged to probe for other vulnerabilities on the server itself or on other back-end systems on the internal network, that the Applio server can reach. The **blind SSRF** can also be coupled with the arbitrary file read CVE-2025-27784 to read files from hosts on the internal network, that the Applio server can reach, which would make it a full SSRF. The **file write** allows for writing files on the server, which can be coupled with other vulnerabilities, for example an **unsafe deserialization**, to achieve remote code execution on the Applio server. As of time of publication, no known patches are available.', key_phrases={'rootcause': '', 'weakness': ['server-side request forgery', 'unsafe deserialization', 'blind SSRF', 'file write'], 'impact': ['remote code execution', 'arbitrary file read', 'file write', 'read files'], 'vector': 'blind SSRF', 'attacker': '', 'product': 'Applio', 'version': '3.2.7 and prior', 'component': 'model_download.py'}, reference_content=\"Here's an analysis of the provided content regarding CVE-2025-27776:\\n\\n**Relevant Content:**\\n\\nThe content from `securitylab.github.com_fc604152_20250624_174057.html` provides detailed information about multiple vulnerabilities in Applio, including those mapped to specific CVEs.\\n\\n*   **CVE-2025-27776 (GHSL-2024-343):**\\n\\n    *   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SSRF and file write. The `model_download.py` on line 240 uses a user-supplied URL through the endpoints on [download.py on line 194](https://github.com/IAHispano/Applio/blob/29b4a00e4be209f9aac51cd9ccffcc632dfb2973/tabs/download/download.py#L192-L196) and [routes.py](https://github.com/IAHispano/Applio/blob/29b4a00e4be209f9aac51cd9ccffcc632dfb2973/assets/flask/routes.py#L14), which leads to an HTTP GET request to arbitrary destinations in `model_download.py` on line 240. The vulnerability resides in the use of `wget.download(url)`.\\n    *   **Impact of exploitation:** Blind server-side request forgery and file write. The SSRF allows sending requests on behalf of the Applio server, potentially probing for other vulnerabilities on the server or internal network. The file write allows writing files on the server, which could be combined with unsafe deserialization vulnerabilities to achieve remote code execution.\\n    *   **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by providing a malicious URL to the application through the download functionality.\\n    *   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to control the URL provided to the vulnerable endpoints.\\n    *   The content provides more detail than the official CVE description, including lines of code, file paths, and specific functions involved.\",

    "enhanced_query": "# Vulnerability Description\n\n    Applio is a voice conversion tool. Versions 3.2.7 and prior are vulnerable to **server-side request forgery** (SSRF) and **file write** in `model_download.py` (line 240 in 3.2.7). The **blind SSRF** allows for sending requests on behalf of Applio server and can be leveraged to probe for other vulnerabilities on the server itself or on other back-end systems on the internal network, that the Applio server can reach. The **blind SSRF** can also be coupled with the arbitrary file read CVE-2025-27784 to read files from hosts on the internal network, that the Applio server can reach, which would make it a full SSRF. The **file write** allows for writing files on the server, which can be coupled with other vulnerabilities, for example an **unsafe deserialization**, to achieve remote code execution on the Applio server. As of time of publication, no known patches are available.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## WEAKNESS: 'server-side request forgery'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this WEAKNESS:\n\n### 1.
