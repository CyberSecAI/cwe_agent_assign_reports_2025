According to RCU usage rules, this is illegal. Reusing this pointer can lead to unpredictable behavior, including accessing memory that has been updated or causing use-after-free issues. This possible bug was identified using a static analysis tool developed by myself, specifically designed to detect RCU-related issues. To address this, the TSF value is now stored in a local variable `ies_tsf` before the RCU lock is released. The `param->tsf_lo` field is then assigned using this local variable, ensuring that the TSF value is safely accessed. Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-413 CWE-908 CWE-476 CWE-126 CWE-824 CWE-665 CWE-362 CWE-911 CWE-667",
