  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved wifi wilc1000 fix potential **RCU dereference issue** in wilc_parse_join_bss_param In the `wilc_parse_join_bss_param` function, the TSF field of the `ies` structure is accessed after the RCU read-side critical section is unlocked. According to RCU usage rules, this is illegal. Reusing this pointer can lead to unpredictable behavior, including accessing memory that has been updated or causing use-after-free issues. This possible bug was identified using a static analysis tool developed by myself, specifically designed to detect RCU-related issues. To address this, the TSF value is now stored in a local variable `ies_tsf` before the RCU lock is released. The `param->tsf_lo` field is then assigned using this local variable, ensuring that the TSF value is safely accessed.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**CVE-2024-47712**\n\n*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from an incorrect usage of RCU (Read-Copy-Update) within the `wilc_parse_join_bss_param` function in the wilc1000 WiFi driver. Specifically, the Time Synchronization Function (TSF) field of the `ies` structure is accessed after the RCU read-side critical section is unlocked.\n\n*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n    *   **RCU Dereference Issue:** Accessing the `ies->tsf` field after releasing the RCU read lock violates RCU usage rules, which can lead to a race condition\n    *   **Use-After-Free Potential:**  Reusing the `ies` pointer after the RCU read-side critical section is unlocked could lead to accessing freed memory or memory that has been modified.\n    *   **Unpredictable Behavior:** This can result in unpredictable program behavior.\n\n*   **Impact of Exploitation:**\n    *   **Memory Corruption:** Accessing invalid memory could lead to memory corruption.\n    *   **Use-After-Free:** Could lead to a use-after-free condition.\n    *  **System Instability:** The unpredictable behavior could lead to system crashes or other instability issues.\n\n*   **Attack Vectors:**\n    *   **WiFi Connection:** The vulnerability is triggered when parsing BSS (Basic Service Set) parameters during a WiFi connection attempt.\n    *  **Specific Device:** The vulnerability exists within the wilc1000 WiFi driver, so it would need to be triggered with an affected device utilizing this driver.\n\n*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n    *   **Proximity to WiFi:** The attacker would need to be within range of a WiFi network that a device using the vulnerable wilc1000 driver is trying to connect to.\n    *  **Control of WiFi Network:** An attacker may need to be able to control certain aspects of the WiFi network.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n*   The vulnerability was identified using a static analysis tool.\n*   The fix involves storing the TSF value in a local variable before releasing the RCU lock, ensuring safe access to the TSF data after the lock is released.\n*   The fix is backported across various kernel branches.\n* The vulnerability is triggered during the parsing of the BSS parameters during a wifi connection.",
