This vulnerability is due to an integer underflow in a bounds check that allows for a heap buffer overflow read. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted file containing OLE2 content to be scanned by ClamAV on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to terminate the ClamAV scanning process, resulting in a DoS condition on the affected software. For a description of this vulnerability, see the . Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
