  "description": "A vulnerability in the Object Linking and Embedding 2 (OLE2) decryption routine of ClamAV could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to an **integer underflow in a bounds check** that allows for a **heap buffer overflow read**. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted file containing OLE2 content to be scanned by ClamAV on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to terminate the ClamAV scanning process, resulting in a DoS condition on the affected software. For a description of this vulnerability, see the . Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.",

The integer underflow leads to a **heap buffer overflow read**.|\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary weakness is an integer underflow (CWE-191) that leads to an out-of-bounds read (CWE-125). CWE-191 can precede CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), which is a parent of CWE-125.
