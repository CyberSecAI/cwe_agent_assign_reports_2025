# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-38476

## Vulnerability Description
Vulnerability in core of Apache HTTP Server 2.4.59 and earlier are vulnerably to information disclosure, SSRF or local script execution via backend applications whose response headers are malicious or exploitable. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.60, which fixes this issue.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **vector:** malicious response headers
- **product:** Apache HTTP Server
- **version:** 2.4.59 and earlier
- **component:** core

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-38476:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability lies in the core of the Apache HTTP Server. It stems from the server's handling of response headers from backend applications. Specifically, the server may use these headers in an exploitable way, leading to information disclosure, SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery), or local script execution via internal redirects.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Improper Handling of Backend Application Output:** The core weakness is that the server does not properly sanitize or validate response headers from backend applications before using them for internal redirects and handler selection. This allows a malicious backend to craft responses that cause the Apache server to perform unintended actions.
- **Vulnerable to Information Disclosure, SSRF and Local Script Execution**: The vulnerability can be exploited by a malicious backend to achieve the following:
    - **Information Disclosure:** by crafting headers to reveal sensitive information.
    - **Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF):**  by crafting headers that force the server to make requests to internal or external resources on behalf of the attacker.
    - **Local Script Execution:** by crafting response headers that cause the server to execute local scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- An attacker controlling or compromising a backend application can potentially use the server's vulnerability to achieve:
    -  **Information disclosure**: Exposing sensitive data, configuration details or internal server information.
   -  **SSRF Attacks:** The attacker may be able to access internal services or make requests to arbitrary URLs, potentially compromising other systems.
   - **Local Script Execution:** Allowing arbitrary code to be run on the server, leading to a full compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector involves a compromised or malicious backend application sending crafted HTTP response headers to the Apache HTTP server.
- The server, upon receiving these malicious headers, triggers an internal redirect or handler selection based on those crafted headers, causing the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Backend Application Control/Compromise:** An attacker needs to have control over, or have compromised, a backend application that interacts with the vulnerable Apache HTTP server.
- **Ability to Craft Malicious HTTP Response Headers:** The attacker needs the ability to generate crafted HTTP response headers from the backend application.

**Additional Notes:**

- **Legacy 'AddType' directive**:  The information also mentions that after the fix, some uses of the 'AddType' directive to connect requests to handlers must be ported to 'SetHandler'. This suggests that legacy configurations using 'AddType' are particularly vulnerable.
- **Affected Versions**: The vulnerability affects Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.0 through 2.4.59.
- **Mitigation**: It is recommended to upgrade to Apache HTTP Server version 2.4.60, which addresses this vulnerability.

In summary, this vulnerability in Apache HTTP Server allows a malicious backend application to manipulate the server's behavior by sending crafted response headers. This could lead to information disclosure, SSRF, or code execution. The attacker needs control over a backend application to exploit this vulnerability.
