# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-8028

## Description

A vulnerability in danswer-ai/danswer v0.3.94 allows an attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) by uploading a file with a malformed multipart boundary. By appending a large number of characters to the end of the multipart boundary, the server continuously processes each character, rendering the application inaccessible. This issue can be exploited by sending a single crafted request, affecting all users on the server.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS)
- **Vector:** uploading a file with a malformed multipart boundary
- **Attacker:** attacker

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE identified is CWE-770, which describes the allocation of resources without limits or throttling. This is directly related to the vulnerability description, where the server continuously processes characters due to a malformed multipart boundary, leading to a denial of service.

CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) is a parent of CWE-770, but CWE-770 is more specific and better captures the root cause of the vulnerability.

CWE-789 (Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value) is a child of CWE-770 and a peer of CWE-1325, which deals with improperly controlled sequential memory allocation. However, the description emphasizes the lack of limits or throttling rather than excessive size values, making CWE-770 a better fit.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **malformed multipart boundary** in the uploaded file. Due to the **lack of limits or throttling** (CWE-770), the server continuously processes the boundary, leading to **denial of service (DoS)**. The root cause is the missing restriction on the amount of resources allocated to processing the uploaded file.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis focuses on the root cause of the denial-of-service vulnerability. The vulnerability description clearly states that the server continuously processes characters because of a malformed multipart boundary, leading to a DoS. The key phrase here is the continuous processing due to the malformed input, which indicates a **lack of limits or throttling** on resource allocation.

The retriever results listed CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) as the top combined result. The description of CWE-770 aligns perfectly with the vulnerability: "The product allocates a reusable resource or group of resources on behalf of an actor without imposing any restrictions on the size or number of resources that can be allocated, in violation of the intended security policy for that actor."

Other CWEs were considered but deemed less appropriate. For instance, CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) is a broader category, while CWE-789 (Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value) is more specific to memory allocation, which is not the primary issue here. The core issue is the absence of limits on processing the input, not necessarily the amount of memory allocated.

The decision to select CWE-770 is based on the evidence in the vulnerability description and the matching description in the CWE specifications. The abstraction level of Base is also preferred as it is a more precise representation of the weakness.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.

## CWE-617: Reachable Assertion
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
