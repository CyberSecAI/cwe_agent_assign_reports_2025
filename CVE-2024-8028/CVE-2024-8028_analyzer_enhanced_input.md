## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability in danswer-ai/danswer v0.3.94 allows an attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) by uploading a file with a malformed multipart boundary. By appending a large number of characters to the end of the multipart boundary, the server continuously processes each character, rendering the application inaccessible. This issue can be exploited by sending a single crafted request, affecting all users on the server.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** Denial of Service (DoS)
- **vector:** uploading a file with a malformed multipart boundary
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** danswer-ai/danswer
- **version:** v0.3.94
