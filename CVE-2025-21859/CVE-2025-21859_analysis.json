CWE-1265 **Unintended Reentrant Invocation of Non-reentrant Code Via Nested Calls** describes the re-entrant call that triggers the deadlock, and CWE-667 **Improper Locking** represents the more general case of improper locking that causes the deadlock.

This directly maps to CWE-833, as it is the explicit outcome. CWE-1265 is also relevant because it describes the re-entrant nature of the call. The relationship graph supports this by showing that CWE-1265 can lead to a deadlock situation.
