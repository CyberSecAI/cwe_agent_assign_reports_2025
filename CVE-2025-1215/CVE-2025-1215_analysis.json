  "description": "A vulnerability classified as problematic was found in vim up to 9.1.1096. This vulnerability affects unknown code of the file src/main.c. The manipulation of the argument --log leads to **memory corruption**. It is possible to launch the attack on the local host. Upgrading to version 9.1.1097 is able to address this issue. The patch is identified as c5654b84480822817bb7b69ebc97c174c91185e9. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component.",

  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-1215 based on provided content\n\nThe provided content relates to **CVE-2025-1215** as it details a crash in Vim when using the `--log` option with an inaccessible path. The content provides more detail than a typical CVE description.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability is triggered when Vim attempts to open a log file at a path that it cannot access. This leads to a segmentation fault.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **Improper error handling:** Vim does not handle the case where the specified log file path is inaccessible gracefully.\n*   **Crash:** The application crashes when it encounters an error opening the log file.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause Vim to crash by providing an invalid or inaccessible log file path, leading to a denial of service.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   **Command-line argument:** The attacker can provide a malicious `--log` argument when launching Vim.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   **Local/Remote:** The attacker needs to be able to execute Vim with specific command-line arguments. This could be local access or remote access if Vim is running as a service or accessible over a network.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\nThe commit `c5654b8` fixes the issue by:\n\n*   Splitting the initialization phase.\n*   Initializing the execution stack earlier.\n*   The fix addresses issue [#16606](https://github.com/vim/vim/issues/16606) and is implemented in pull request [#16610](https://github.com/vim/vim/pull/16610).\n*   The fix is included in tag `v9.1.1097`.\n\n**Additional details from the content:**\n\n*   The issue was reproduced with Vim commit `68d0858`.\n*   The stack trace provided in the issue report points to `message.c` and `logfile.c` as the source of the crash.\n*   The error message generated is \"E484: Can't open file\".\n*   The fix involves changes to `main.c`, `message_test.c`, `proto/main.pro`, `testdir/test_startup.vim`, and `version.c`.\n*   The tag `v9.1.1097` is verified with a GPG signature.",

CWE-787 is a specific type of CWE-119.\nCWE-123 (Write-what-where Condition) was considered as a secondary candidate because it represents a more general case of memory corruption.\nThe base abstraction level was chosen to provide a detailed description of the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe123[\"CWE-123: Write-what-where Condition\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe123 -->|PEEROF| cwe787\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper handling of the --log argument**, leading to **memory corruption** due to an **out-of-bounds write**.\n- **Root Cause:** Improper input handling of the --log argument\n- **Weakness:** Out-of-bounds Write (CWE-787)\n- **Impact:** Memory Corruption\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment, based on the vulnerability description, pointed towards **memory corruption** due to manipulation of the `--log` argument in vim. The key phrase \"manipulation of the argument --log leads to **memory corruption**\" helped narrow down the potential CWEs.\n\nThe \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" provided more information. It specifically mentioned that the vulnerability is triggered when Vim attempts to open a log file at a path that it cannot access, leading to a segmentation fault. This further strengthens the argument for **improper error handling** and an **out-of-bounds write** scenario.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the final selection by emphasizing the parent-child relationship between CWE-119 and CWE-787. Since the evidence supports a specific out-of-bounds write scenario, CWE-787 was chosen over its parent.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately represent the root cause and impact of the vulnerability.
