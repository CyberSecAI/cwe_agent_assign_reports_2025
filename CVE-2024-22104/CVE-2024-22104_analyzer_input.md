**1. Verification of Relevance:**

The provided content directly mentions CVE-2024-22104 as one of the vulnerabilities affecting Mitsubishi Electric's FA engineering software products due to issues in Jungo's WinDriver.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of CVE-2024-22104, is an "Out-of-bounds Write" vulnerability within Jungo's WinDriver.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

   - Out-of-bounds Write (CWE-787): The software attempts to write data beyond the allocated memory buffer.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

  - Denial of Service (DoS): Successful exploitation could lead to a Windows blue screen (BSOD) error, causing a denial-of-service condition.
  - Note: The advisory from Mitsubishi Electric also mentions that attacks against these vulnerabilities can be detected by Microsoft Windows Defender.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

  - Local Attack: The vulnerability can be exploited by executing malicious code on a computer where the affected software is installed.
  - No Remote Exploitation: The CISA advisory explicitly states that the vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

  - Local Access: The attacker needs to have local access to the system where the vulnerable software is installed.
  - Malicious Code Execution: The attacker must be able to execute malicious code on the target system.
  - User Interaction: Exploitation requires a user to take an action (UI:R) to trigger the vulnerability.
  - Low Privilege: The attacker only requires low privileges (PR:L) to exploit the vulnerability.
  - High Attack Complexity: The attack is complex due to the specific conditions and timing required to trigger the out-of-bounds write.

**Summary of Technical Details:**

The vulnerability resides within Jungo's WinDriver, and is triggered by an out-of-bounds write. An attacker with local access and the ability to execute arbitrary code on the system can exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial-of-service condition.

**Additional Notes:**

-   The Mitsubishi Electric advisory provides a comprehensive list of affected products and versions.
-   Mitigation measures include restricting physical access, using antivirus software, and avoiding untrusted files/links.
-   Patches are available for some affected products.
-   The CISA advisory confirms the local nature of the attack and also notes the high attack complexity.
-  The CISA advisory mentions CVSS v4 vector: [CVSS4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:P/PR:L/UI:A/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/4.0#CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:P/PR:L/UI:A/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N)
