  "description": "Applio is a voice conversion tool. Versions 3.2.8-bugfix and prior are vulnerable to **arbitrary file read** in train.pys `export_index` function. This issue may lead to reading arbitrary files on the Applio server. It can also be used in conjunction with blind server-side request forgery to read files from servers on the internal network that the Applio server has access to.

  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-27785 based on provided content\n\nThe provided content details 13 vulnerabilities found in Applio, ranging from SSRF and arbitrary file writes to unsafe deserialization and arbitrary file removal. CVE-2025-27785 is specifically identified as relating to **GHSL-2024-352**, which is described as **Arbitrary file read in train.py `export_index` function**.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the relevant information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe `index_dropdown_export` function in `tabs/train/train.py` takes arbitrary user input and passes it to the `export_index` function. This function checks if the provided path exists and, if so, returns it to the user without any restrictions.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Arbitrary file read.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nAn attacker can read arbitrary files on the Applio server. This could be combined with a blind SSRF vulnerability to read files from internal network resources accessible to the server.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\nAn attacker can exploit the vulnerability by providing a malicious path to the `index_dropdown_export` function.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\nThe attacker needs to be able to provide input to the `index_dropdown_export` function, which likely means they need to be able to access the relevant part of the Applio application.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\nThe advisory does not specify a fix, but it implies that proper input validation and sanitization are needed to prevent arbitrary file access.  Specifically, restricting the paths that can be accessed by the `export_index` function.\n\n**Additional Details (more detail than official CVE description):**\n\n*   The vulnerable code is located in `tabs/train/train.py` lines L816 and `export_index` function in `tabs/train/train.py` line L273.\n*   The vulnerability was discovered by Sylwia Budzynska of the GitHub Security Lab.\n*   The CodeQL path injection query was used to find the vulnerability.",

The `export_index` function then checks if the file exists and returns it to the user without proper validation, leading to **arbitrary file read**. This can then be chained with **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)** to read internal files.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness identified is **CWE-22**, based on the **improper limitation of a pathname** provided by the user. The vulnerability description states that the application takes arbitrary user input and passes it to the `export_index` function, which checks if the provided path exists and, if so, returns it to the user without any restrictions. This allows an attacker to read arbitrary files on the Applio server.\n\nThe description also mentions that this can be used in conjunction with blind **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**, which indicates a secondary weakness, **CWE-918**. This allows an attacker to read files from servers on the internal network that the Applio server has access to.\n\nThe retriever results also support **CWE-22** and **CWE-918** as potential weaknesses.\n\n**CWE-23 (Relative Path Traversal)** was considered, but **CWE-22** is a better fit because it is a more general case of path traversal. **CWE-23** specifically refers to the use of \"..\" sequences, while **CWE-22** covers all cases where the pathname is not properly limited to a restricted directory.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately represent the weaknesses present in the vulnerability description.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n- \"Arbitrary file read in train.py `export_index` function\"\n- \"This issue may lead to reading arbitrary files on the Applio server.\"\n- \"It can also be used in conjunction with blind server-side request forgery to read files from servers on the internal network that the Applio server has access to.\"\n- \"The `index_dropdown_export` function in `tabs/train/train.py` takes arbitrary user input and passes it to the `export_index` function.
