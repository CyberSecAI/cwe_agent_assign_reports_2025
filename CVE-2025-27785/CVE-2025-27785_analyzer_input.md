# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-27785

## Vulnerability Description
Applio is a voice conversion tool. Versions 3.2.8-bugfix and prior are vulnerable to **arbitrary file read** in train.pys `export_index` function. This issue may lead to reading arbitrary files on the Applio server. It can also be used in conjunction with blind server-side request forgery to read files from servers on the internal network that the Applio server has access to. As of time of publication, no known patches are available.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **arbitrary file read**
- **impact:** blind server-side request forgery and arbitrary file read and read files
- **product:** Applio
- **version:** 3.2.8-bugfix and prior
- **component:** train.pys `export_index` function

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-27785 based on provided content

The provided content details 13 vulnerabilities found in Applio, ranging from SSRF and arbitrary file writes to unsafe deserialization and arbitrary file removal. CVE-2025-27785 is specifically identified as relating to **GHSL-2024-352**, which is described as **Arbitrary file read in train.py `export_index` function**.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The `index_dropdown_export` function in `tabs/train/train.py` takes arbitrary user input and passes it to the `export_index` function. This function checks if the provided path exists and, if so, returns it to the user without any restrictions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Arbitrary file read.

**Impact of exploitation:**

An attacker can read arbitrary files on the Applio server. This could be combined with a blind SSRF vulnerability to read files from internal network resources accessible to the server.

**Attack vectors:**

An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by providing a malicious path to the `index_dropdown_export` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

The attacker needs to be able to provide input to the `index_dropdown_export` function, which likely means they need to be able to access the relevant part of the Applio application.

**Mitigation or fix:**

The advisory does not specify a fix, but it implies that proper input validation and sanitization are needed to prevent arbitrary file access.  Specifically, restricting the paths that can be accessed by the `export_index` function.

**Additional Details (more detail than official CVE description):**

*   The vulnerable code is located in `tabs/train/train.py` lines L816 and `export_index` function in `tabs/train/train.py` line L273.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Sylwia Budzynska of the GitHub Security Lab.
*   The CodeQL path injection query was used to find the vulnerability.
