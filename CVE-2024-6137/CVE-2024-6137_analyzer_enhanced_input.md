## Vulnerability Description
BT Classic SDP OOB access in get_att_search_list

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** OOB access
- **product:** BT Classic SDP
- **component:** get_att_search_list

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds write in the `get_att_search_list` function within `subsys/bluetooth/host/sdp.c`. The function parses data elements without limiting the number it processes, which leads to an out-of-bounds write in subsequent accesses of the `filter` array.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Out-of-bounds write:** The `filter` array, which is used to store attribute IDs, can be written beyond its allocated size due to the lack of a limit on the parsed `data_elem` count.
- **Stack overflow:** When the number of parsed `data_elem` exceeds the maximum allowed by the filter array size (`MAX_NUM_ATT_ID_FILTER`), a stack overflow occurs due to out-of-bounds writes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Instability (crash):** The out-of-bounds write can corrupt the stack and lead to a crash of the affected system.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By triggering the stack overflow, an attacker can render the system unusable, effectively causing a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is adjacent, meaning that the attacker must be within the physical or logical proximity of the vulnerable device to exploit the vulnerability. This likely refers to the Bluetooth communication range.
- The attacker needs to send a specially crafted Bluetooth SDP (Service Discovery Protocol) request with a specific number of `data_elem`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be within the communication range of the vulnerable device, as the vulnerability is triggered through Bluetooth communication.
- No special privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability.
- No user interaction is needed.

**Additional Information:**
- The `MAX_NUM_ATT_ID_FILTER` is set to 10, which means more than 10 `data_elem` need to be included in the crafted packet.
- The vulnerable function is called by `sdp_svc_att_req` or `sdp_svc_search_att_req`.
- The `data_size` of each `data_elem` needs to be 2 or 4 to increment the `num_filter`. An example of such a data element could be `08 ff ff`

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-129: Improper Validation of Array Index
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses untrusted input when calculating or using an array index, but the product does not validate or incorrectly validates the index to ensure the index references a valid position within the array.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
out-of-bounds array index
index-out-of-range
array index underflow

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-1285
ChildOf -> CWE-20
CanPrecede -> CWE-119
CanPrecede -> CWE-823
CanPrecede -> CWE-789

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This weakness can precede uncontrolled memory allocation (CWE-789) in languages that automatically expand an array when an index is used that is larger than the size of the array, such as JavaScript.

**[Theoretical]** An improperly validated array index might lead directly to the always-incorrect behavior of "access of array using out-of-bounds index."



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2005-0369:** large ID in packet used as array index
- **CVE-2001-1009:** negative array index as argument to POP LIST command
- **CVE-2003-0721:** Integer signedness error leads to negative array index




## CWE-833: Deadlock
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product contains multiple threads or executable segments that are waiting for each other to release a necessary lock, resulting in deadlock.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-667
ChildOf -> CWE-662

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-1999-1476:** A bug in some Intel Pentium processors allow DoS (hang) via an invalid "CMPXCHG8B" instruction, causing a deadlock
- **CVE-2009-2857:** OS deadlock
- **CVE-2009-1961:** OS deadlock involving 3 separate functions




## CWE-922: Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product stores sensitive information without properly limiting read or write access by unauthorized actors.

### Extended Description
If read access is not properly restricted, then attackers can steal the sensitive information. If write access is not properly restricted, then attackers can modify and possibly delete the data, causing incorrect results and possibly a denial of service.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-664

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** There is an overlapping relationship between insecure storage of sensitive information (CWE-922) and missing encryption of sensitive information (CWE-311). Encryption is often used to prevent an attacker from reading the sensitive data. However, encryption does not prevent the attacker from erasing or overwriting the data. While data tampering would be visible upon inspection, the integrity and availability of the data is compromised prior to the audit.

**[Maintenance]** This is a high-level entry that includes children from various parts of the CWE research view (CWE-1000). Currently, most of the information is in these child entries. This entry will be made more comprehensive in later CWE versions.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2009-2272:** password and username stored in cleartext in a cookie




## CWE-694: Use of Multiple Resources with Duplicate Identifier
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses multiple resources that can have the same identifier, in a context in which unique identifiers are required.

### Extended Description
If the product assumes that each resource has a unique identifier, the product could operate on the wrong resource if attackers can cause multiple resources to be associated with the same identifier.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-99
ChildOf -> CWE-573

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This weakness is probably closely associated with other issues related to doubling, such as CWE-675 (Duplicate Operations on Resource). It's often a case of an API contract violation (CWE-227).



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2013-4787:** chain: mobile OS verifies cryptographic signature of file in an archive, but then installs a different file with the same name that is also listed in the archive.

- **CVE-2014-0160:** Chain: "Heartbleed" bug receives an inconsistent length parameter (CWE-130) enabling an out-of-bounds read (CWE-126), returning memory that could include private cryptographic keys and other sensitive data.




## CWE-1067: Excessive Execution of Sequential Searches of Data Resource
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product contains a data query against an SQL table or view
					that is configured in a way that does not utilize an index and may cause
					sequential searches to be performed.

### Extended Description


This issue can make the product perform more slowly. If the relevant code is reachable by an attacker, then this performance problem might introduce a vulnerability.


### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-1176

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use






## CWE-823: Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product performs pointer arithmetic on a valid pointer, but it uses an offset that can point outside of the intended range of valid memory locations for the resulting pointer.

### Extended Description


While a pointer can contain a reference to any arbitrary memory location, a program typically only intends to use the pointer to access limited portions of memory, such as contiguous memory used to access an individual array.


Programs may use offsets in order to access fields or sub-elements stored within structured data. The offset might be out-of-range if it comes from an untrusted source, is the result of an incorrect calculation, or occurs because of another error.


If an attacker can control or influence the offset so that it points outside of the intended boundaries of the structure, then the attacker may be able to read or write to memory locations that are used elsewhere in the product. As a result, the attack might change the state of the product as accessed through program variables, cause a crash or instable behavior, and possibly lead to code execution.


### Alternative Terms
Untrusted pointer offset: This term is narrower than the concept of "out-of-range" offset, since the offset might be the result of a calculation or other error that does not depend on any externally-supplied values.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-119
ChildOf -> CWE-119
ChildOf -> CWE-119
CanPrecede -> CWE-125
CanPrecede -> CWE-787

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** There are close relationships between incorrect pointer dereferences and other weaknesses related to buffer operations. There may not be sufficient community agreement regarding these relationships. Further study is needed to determine when these relationships are chains, composites, perspective/layering, or other types of relationships. As of September 2010, most of the relationships are being captured as chains.

**[Terminology]** Many weaknesses related to pointer dereferences fall under the general term of "memory corruption" or "memory safety." As of September 2010, there is no commonly-used terminology that covers the lower-level variants.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2010-2160:** Invalid offset in undocumented opcode leads to memory corruption.
- **CVE-2010-1281:** Multimedia player uses untrusted value from a file when using file-pointer calculations.
- **CVE-2009-3129:** Spreadsheet program processes a record with an invalid size field, which is later used as an offset.




## CWE-176: Improper Handling of Unicode Encoding
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not properly handle when an input contains Unicode encoding.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-172

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2000-0884:** Server allows remote attackers to read documents outside of the web root, and possibly execute arbitrary commands, via malformed URLs that contain Unicode encoded characters.
- **CVE-2001-0709:** Server allows a remote attacker to obtain source code of ASP files via a URL encoded with Unicode.
- **CVE-2001-0669:** Overlaps interaction error.




## CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification)
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product does not properly control situations in which an adversary can cause the product to consume or produce excessive resources without requiring the adversary to invest equivalent work or otherwise prove authorization, i.e., the adversary's influence is "asymmetric."

### Extended Description
This can lead to poor performance due to "amplification" of resource consumption, typically in a non-linear fashion. This situation is worsened if the product allows malicious users or attackers to consume more resources than their access level permits.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-400

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-1999-0513:** Classic "Smurf" attack, using spoofed ICMP packets to broadcast addresses.
- **CVE-2003-1564:** Parsing library allows XML bomb
- **CVE-2004-2458:** Tool creates directories before authenticating user.




## CWE-676: Use of Potentially Dangerous Function
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product invokes a potentially dangerous function that could introduce a vulnerability if it is used incorrectly, but the function can also be used safely.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-1177

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This weakness is different than CWE-242 (Use of Inherently Dangerous Function). CWE-242 covers functions with such significant security problems that they can never be guaranteed to be safe. Some functions, if used properly, do not directly pose a security risk, but can introduce a weakness if not called correctly. These are regarded as potentially dangerous. A well-known example is the strcpy() function. When provided with a destination buffer that is larger than its source, strcpy() will not overflow. However, it is so often misused that some developers prohibit strcpy() entirely.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2007-1470:** Library has multiple buffer overflows using sprintf() and strcpy()
- **CVE-2009-3849:** Buffer overflow using strcat()
- **CVE-2006-2114:** Buffer overflow using strcpy()
