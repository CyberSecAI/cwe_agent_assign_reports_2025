  "description": "pyrage is a set of Python bindings for the rage file encryption library (age in Rust). `pyrage` uses the Rust `age` crate for its underlying operations, and `age` is vulnerable to GHSA-4fg7-vxc8-qx5w. All details of GHSA-4fg7-vxc8-qx5w are relevant to `pyrage` for the versions specified in this advisory. See GHSA-4fg7-vxc8-qx5w for full details. Versions of `pyrage` before 1.2.0 lack plugin support and are therefore **not affected**. An equivalent issue was fixed in [the reference Go implementation of age](https//github.com/FiloSottile/age), see advisory GHSA-32gq-x56h-299c. This issue has been addressed in version 1.2.3 and all users are advised to update. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-56327:\n\n**CVE-2024-56327**\n\n*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the way `pyrage` (a Python wrapper for the `age` encryption tool) handles plugin names. It does not properly sanitize plugin names, allowing an attacker to introduce path separators. This enables the execution of arbitrary binaries.\n*   **Weaknesses:**\n    *   **CWE-25 (Path Traversal):** The core vulnerability is that the application does not sanitize the path to the plugin. This allows an attacker to specify an arbitrary path that could lead to unintended execution of binaries.\n    *   **Insecure Plugin Handling:** The underlying issue lies in the `age` crate (used by `pyrage`) which doesn't validate or sanitize plugin names.\n*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary binary execution on the system where `pyrage` is running. This could result in a wide range of malicious activities such as data exfiltration, system compromise, or denial of service.\n*   **Attack Vectors:**\n    *   **Malicious Plugin Names:** An attacker can provide a crafted plugin name that contains path separators through attacker-controlled recipient or identity strings. This malicious plugin name is passed to the underlying `age` library/crate.\n    *   **Vulnerable APIs:** The vulnerability can be triggered when using the `plugin.NewIdentity`, `plugin.NewIdentityWithoutData`, or `plugin.NewRecipient` APIs from `filippo.io/age/plugin` (in the Go version), or equivalent functions in the `age` Rust crate.\n*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n    *   The attacker needs to be able to control or influence the recipient or identity string which is passed to the vulnerable functions/APIs.\n    *   On Unix-like systems, a directory with the format `${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/age-plugin-*` needs to exist for the attack to be successful in the Go implementation. For the rust implementation, a directory matching the pattern `age-plugin-*` needs to exist in the working directory.\n*   **Affected Software:**\n    *   `pyrage` versions 1.2.0, 1.2.1, and 1.2.2. Versions before 1.2.0 lack plugin support and are not affected.\n* **Additional notes**:\n    *   The vulnerability in `pyrage` is a consequence of its use of the vulnerable `age` crate. The `age` crate (used by `rage` and `pyrage`) and the Go implementation (`filippo.io/age/plugin`) have the same vulnerability.\n    *   The binary is executed with the `--age-plugin=recipient-v1` or `--age-plugin=identity-v1` flag and the standard input includes the recipient/identity string and the file key/header. The format is constrained by the [age-plugin](https://c2sp.org/age-plugin) protocol.\n    *   The same vulnerability is tracked as GHSA-4fg7-vxc8-qx5w for the `rage` project (which uses the vulnerable `age` crate) and GHSA-32gq-x56h-299c for the Go implementation of `age`.\n\nThe provided content offers more detail than the basic CVE description by specifying the vulnerable APIs and the exact conditions for the attack to succeed, including the directory structure required on Unix systems. It also clarifies the relationship between this CVE and similar issues in the `age` crate and Go implementation of `age`.",
