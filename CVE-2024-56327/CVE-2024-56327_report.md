# Analysis Report for CVE-2024-56327

# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-56327

## Description

pyrage is a set of Python bindings for the rage file encryption library (age in Rust). `pyrage` uses the Rust `age` crate for its underlying operations, and `age` is vulnerable to GHSA-4fg7-vxc8-qx5w. All details of GHSA-4fg7-vxc8-qx5w are relevant to `pyrage` for the versions specified in this advisory. See GHSA-4fg7-vxc8-qx5w for full details. Versions of `pyrage` before 1.2.0 lack plugin support and are therefore **not affected**. An equivalent issue was fixed in [the reference Go implementation of age](https//github.com/FiloSottile/age), see advisory GHSA-32gq-x56h-299c. This issue has been addressed in version 1.2.3 and all users are advised to update. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-22 | Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') | 1.0 | Base | Primary CWE | Allowed |
| CWE-73 | External Control of File Name or Path | 0.7 | Base | Secondary Candidate | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE selected is CWE-22, which represents the core **path traversal** vulnerability. CWE-73 is a parent of CWE-22 and represents the broader category of external control of file names or paths. The relationship influenced the decision to choose CWE-22 for it's more specific and accurately describes the vulnerability.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain begins with the **improper** handling of plugin names, leading to a **path traversal** vulnerability, which ultimately allows for arbitrary binary execution.
  - The root cause is the **lack of sanitization** of plugin names.
  - The weakness leads to the ability to control the file path used for plugin execution.
  - The impact is arbitrary binary execution, potentially leading to system compromise.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is based on the provided CVE description and the "CVE Reference Links Content Summary." The core vulnerability is the **improper** sanitization of plugin names, allowing an attacker to inject path separators and execute arbitrary binaries. This aligns directly with CWE-22, Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal').

The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" states: "The vulnerability stems from the way `pyrage` (a Python wrapper for the `age` encryption tool) handles plugin names. It does not properly sanitize plugin names, allowing an attacker to introduce path separators. This enables the execution of arbitrary binaries." and "The core vulnerability is that the application does not sanitize the path to the plugin. This allows an attacker to specify an arbitrary path that could lead to unintended execution of binaries."

CWE-22 is the most specific and appropriate CWE because it directly addresses the **path traversal** issue resulting from the **lack of sanitization**. While CWE-73 (External Control of File Name or Path) is a broader category, CWE-22 provides a more precise classification of the vulnerability.

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-1286: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input that is expected to be well-formed - i.e., to comply with a certain syntax - but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input complies with the syntax.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
An algorithm in a product has an inefficient worst-case computational complexity that may be detrimental to system performance and can be triggered by an attacker, typically using crafted manipulations that ensure that the worst case is being reached.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-88: Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs a string for a command to be executed by a separate component
in another control sphere, but it does not properly delimit the
intended arguments, options, or switches within that command string.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-129: Improper Validation of Array Index
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses untrusted input when calculating or using an array index, but the product does not validate or incorrectly validates the index to ensure the index references a valid position within the array.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
