  "query": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved mm use aligned address in copy_user_gigantic_page() In current kernel, hugetlb_wp() calls copy_user_large_folio() with the fault address. Where the fault address may be not aligned with the huge page size. Then, copy_user_large_folio() may call copy_user_gigantic_page() with the address, while copy_user_gigantic_page() requires the address to be huge page size aligned. So, this may cause memory corruption or information leak, addtional, use more obvious naming addr_hint instead of addr for copy_user_gigantic_page().",
