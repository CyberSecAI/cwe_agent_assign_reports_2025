An authenticated user with read-only permissions can bypass these controls.\n- **Impact of exploitation**:  An attacker with read-only privileges can execute sensitive operations by sending crafted requests. This could lead to unauthorized actions and potentially severe consequences.\n- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves crafting specific requests to the vulnerable system.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least read-only permission to exploit this vulnerability.",

This results in an attacker gaining unauthorized access.\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Client-side enforcement of server-side security** leading to **improper access control**.\n2.  **Weakness:** The product does not properly restrict access to resources.\n3.  **Exploit:** Attacker crafts requests to bypass client-side checks.\n4.  **Impact:** Unauthorized access.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis focuses on the **root cause** and the specific mechanism of exploitation. The primary weakness is clearly **improper access control**, stemming from inadequate server-side security enforcement.\n\nThe evidence provided points to **improper access control** due to **client-side enforcement of server-side security**. The vulnerability description states that the products \"allows attacker to **improper access control** via crafted requests.\"\n\nCWE-284 directly addresses the **improper access control** weakness. Other CWEs, such as CWE-200 and CWE-668, are related but represent the potential impact of the weakness rather than the root cause. CWE-280 was also considered but determined less precise than CWE-284.\n\nThe selection of CWE-284 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly addresses the **improper access control** issue without being overly broad or narrow.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).

This may cause it to follow unexpected code paths that may leave the product in an invalid state.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base",
