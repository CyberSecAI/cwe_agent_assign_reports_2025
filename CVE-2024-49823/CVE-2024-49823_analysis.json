No child CWEs were identified that were a more precise match given the information provided. CWE-400 relates to other potential weaknesses like CWE-770 [Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling] and CWE-789 [Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value], however there is no direct evidence in the vulnerability description.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe789[\"CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\"]\n\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    cwe789 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe400 primary\n    class cwe770,cwe789 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **specially crafted sequence of valid requests** from an **authenticated user** leading to **denial of service**. The root cause is the IBM Common Cryptographic Architecture's **uncontrolled resource consumption** when processing the requests. The impact is a denial of service in the Hardware Security Module (HSM).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description states that an authenticated user can cause a denial of service in the Hardware Security Module (HSM) using a **specially crafted sequence of valid requests**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary indicates the same, stating \"CVE-2024-49823 is described as a vulnerability that \"could allow a remote user to cause a denial of service\"\". This suggests that the system does not properly manage the resources consumed by these requests, leading to a denial-of-service condition.\n\nThe Retriever Results suggested several CWEs, including CWE-799 [Improper Control of Interaction Frequency], CWE-20 [Improper Input Validation], CWE-327 [Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm], CWE-248 [Uncaught Exception], CWE-755 [Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions], CWE-23 [Relative Path Traversal], CWE-400 [Uncontrolled Resource Consumption], CWE-476 [NULL Pointer Dereference], and CWE-1240 [Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation].\n\nBased on the vulnerability description, CWE-400 [Uncontrolled Resource Consumption] is the most appropriate because the vulnerability results in a denial of service, which is a direct consequence of uncontrolled resource consumption. The other CWEs were not selected because they do not directly address the root cause of the denial of service. The **specially crafted sequence of valid requests** is the attack vector and CWE-400 explains the **root cause** of the vulnerability.\n\nThe selection of CWE-400 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the uncontrolled resource consumption leading to the denial of service. While more specific CWEs related to resource management exist (e.g., CWE-770 [Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling], CWE-789 [Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value]), the provided information does not provide sufficient detail to pinpoint the exact type of resource that is being consumed without control. Thus, CWE-400 provides the best balance of accuracy and generality.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm or protocol.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
