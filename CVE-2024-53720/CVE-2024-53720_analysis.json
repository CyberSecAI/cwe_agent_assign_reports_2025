The specific impact will vary depending on the actions available within the plugin and the user's privileges.\n- **Attack vectors:** A successful CSRF attack can be launched if a logged-in user with higher privileges visits a malicious website.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a website containing malicious code that exploits the CSRF vulnerability. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.",

The resulting action, in this case, allows for **stored XSS** because of the **improper neutralization of input**.\nCWE-352's relationship to other CWEs is that it often requires other CWEs to be present to be exploitable.
