## Vulnerability Description
Monkeytype is a minimalistic and customizable typing test. Monkeytype is vulnerable to Poisoned Pipeline Execution through **Code Injection** in its ci-failure-comment.yml GitHub Workflow, enabling attackers to gain pull-requests write access. The ci-failure-comment.yml workflow is triggered when the Monkey CI workflow completes. When it runs, it will download an artifact uploaded by the triggering workflow and assign the contents of ./pr_num/pr_num.txt artifact to the steps.pr_num_reader.outputs.content WorkFlow variable. It is not validated that the variable is actually a number and later it is interpolated into a JS script allowing an attacker to change the code to be executed. This issue leads to pull-requests write access. This vulnerability is fixed in 24.30.0.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **Code Injection**
- **impact:** gain pull-requests write access
- **attacker:** attackers
- **product:** Monkeytype
- **version:** before 24.30.0
- **component:** ci-failure-comment.yml GitHub Workflow

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a code injection flaw in the `ci-failure-comment.yml` GitHub workflow of the `monkeytype` project. This workflow is triggered upon completion of the `Monkey CI` workflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Unvalidated Input:** The `ci-failure-comment.yml` workflow downloads an artifact from the triggering workflow. It then reads the content of a file (`pr_num.txt`) from this artifact and assigns it to the `steps.pr_num_reader.outputs.content` workflow variable. Critically, it does not validate if this content is actually a number.
*   **Code Injection:** The unvalidated content of the variable is directly interpolated into a JavaScript script used by the `actions/github-script` action. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code, leading to Poisoned Pipeline Execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Pull Request Write Access:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain `pull-requests` write access within the repository. This level of access allows modification to pull requests.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The injected JavaScript code executes within the GitHub Actions environment, effectively granting the attacker code execution within the context of the workflow.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Pull Request Triggered Workflow:** The attack is initiated by creating a pull request that modifies the `monkey-ci.yml` workflow to upload a malicious payload in the `pr_num.txt` artifact.
*   **Workflow Chaining:**  The `Monkey CI` workflow uploads the malicious payload artifact, which then triggers the vulnerable `ci-failure-comment.yml` workflow, which then downloads and uses the malicious payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Forked Repository:** The attacker needs to fork the target repository (`monkeytype`).
*   **Create a Branch:** The attacker needs to create a branch within their fork.
*   **Modify Workflow File:** The attacker needs to modify the `monkey-ci.yml` workflow file to include steps to create and upload a malicious artifact.
*   **Create Pull Request:** The attacker needs to create a pull request to the main branch of the target repository with the modified workflow file.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in versions `<=v24.29.0` and was fixed in versions `>=v24.30.0`.
*   The fix replaces the vulnerable `github-script` action with `peter-evans/create-or-update-comment@v4`, and passes the issue number through an environment variable rather than directly interpolating it into a script, mitigating the injection vulnerability.
*   The provided content included a proof-of-concept demonstrating the vulnerability and the fix commit.
*   The content also references resources about expression injection and keeping github actions secure, showing additional information than the CVE description alone.
