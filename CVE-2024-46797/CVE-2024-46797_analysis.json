  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolvedpowerpc/qspinlock Fix deadlock in MCS queueIf an interrupt occurs in queued_spin_lock_slowpath() after we incrementqnodesp->count and before node->lock is initialized, another CPU mightsee stale lock values in get_tail_qnode(). If the stale lock value happensto match the lock on that CPU, then we write to the next pointer ofthe wrong qnode.

  "reference_content": "The provided content relates to CVE-2024-46797.\n\n**Root Cause:**\nA race condition in the `queued_spin_lock_slowpath()` function of the PowerPC architecture's qspinlock implementation can lead to a deadlock. This occurs when an interrupt happens after the `qnodesp->count` is incremented but before the `node->lock` is initialized.\n\n**Vulnerabilities/Weaknesses:**\n- **Race Condition:** The core issue lies in the timing window between incrementing the queue counter and initializing the lock field in the MCS queue node. An interrupt during this window can lead to inconsistent state.\n- **Stale Lock Values:** Another CPU might read stale lock values from the queue due to the race condition.\n- **Incorrect Next Pointer:** When a stale lock value is read, the next pointer of the wrong qnode might get written to, creating a circular dependency.\n- **MCS Queue Deadlock:** When the initial CPU becomes the head of the MCS queue, it spins indefinitely because its next pointer was never correctly set.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\nThe vulnerability results in a system deadlock. The affected CPU becomes unresponsive, leading to a hard lockup. This can impact the overall system stability and availability, potentially requiring a system reboot to recover.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Interrupt Timing:** The exploit relies on a carefully timed interrupt that occurs during the critical window in `queued_spin_lock_slowpath()`.\n- **Contended Locks:** The deadlock is more likely to happen under high contention for multiple locks as this triggers the slow path of spin lock which utilizes the mentioned queue.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- The attacker needs to trigger a specific sequence of operations and timing to cause the interrupt at the right moment to trigger the race condition.\n- The attacker would need to be able to execute code on the affected system.\n\n**Technical Details:**\nThe fix involves clearing the `node->lock` before releasing the node and inserting a memory barrier to prevent further stores to the node after it has been released. This ensures that no CPU sees stale values if an interrupt occurs after `qnodesp->count` is incremented but before `node->lock` is initialized. The critical code change is:\n\n```c\nrelease:\n    /*\n     * Clear the lock before releasing the node, as another CPU might see stale\n     * values if an interrupt occurs after we increment qnodesp->count\n     * but before node->lock is initialized. The barrier ensures that\n     * there are no further stores to the node after it has been released.\n     */\n    node->lock = NULL;\n    barrier();\n    qnodesp->count--;\n```\nThe provided content offers more details than a typical CVE description.",
