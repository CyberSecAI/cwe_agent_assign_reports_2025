If the stale lock value happensto match the lock on that CPU, then we write to the next pointer ofthe wrong qnode. This causes a deadlock as the former CPU, once it becomesthe head of the MCS queue, will spin indefinitely until its next pointeris set by its successor in the queue.Running stress-ng on a 16 core (16EC/16VP) shared LPAR, results inoccasional lockups similar to the following $ stress-ng --all 128 --vm-bytes 80% --aggressive \\ --maximize --oomable --verify --syslog \\ --metrics --times --timeout 5m watchdog CPU 15 Hard LOCKUP ......
