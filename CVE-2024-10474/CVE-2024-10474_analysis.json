The application **incorrectly allows internal links to utilize the app scheme** used for deeplinking, leading to potential circumvention of URL safety checks.

Since the vulnerability allows the use of internal links to untrusted targets, which could bypass URL safety checks, this CWE might be applicable. |\n| CWE-59 | Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following') | 0.5 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate. While not a direct fit, the circumvention of URL safety checks could be seen as a form of improper link resolution. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship influencing the decision is the direct match between the vulnerability description and CWE-939, which focuses on improper authorization in custom URL scheme handlers. While other CWEs were considered, they represent related but less direct aspects of the vulnerability, such as the use of web links to untrusted targets (CWE-1022) or improper link resolution (CWE-59). The abstraction levels of the selected CWEs (Base and Variant) provide a good level of specificity.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe939[\"CWE-939: Improper Authorization in Handler for Custom URL Scheme\"]\n    cwe1022[\"CWE-1022: Use of Web Link to Untrusted Target with window.opener Access\"]\n    cwe59[\"CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')\"]\n    \n    cwe1022 -->|PEEROF| cwe939\n    cwe59 -->|RELATED_TO| cwe939\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe939 primary\n    class cwe1022,cwe59 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **incorrectly allowing internal links to utilize the app scheme**. This **weakness** then allows those links to potentially circumvent URL safety checks.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is primarily based on the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which explicitly mentions that \"Focus for iOS was **incorrectly allowing internal links to utilize the app scheme** used for deeplinking.\" This directly supports the selection of CWE-939 (Improper Authorization in Handler for Custom URL Scheme) as the primary CWE. The relationship graph shows the connections between the selected CWEs and other potentially relevant CWEs. While other CWEs like CWE-1022 and CWE-59 were considered, they are less specific to the root cause of the vulnerability.
