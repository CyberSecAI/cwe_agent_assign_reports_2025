# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2025-43844
## Query
Retrieval-based-Voice-Conversion-WebUI is a voice changing framework based on VITS. Versions 2.2.231006 and prior are vulnerable to command injection. The variables exp_dir1, among others, take user input and pass it to the click_train function, which concatenates them into a command that is run on the server. This can lead to arbitrary command execution. As of time of publication, no known patches exist.

## Keyphrases
