  "query": "Starting in Python 3.12.0, the asyncio._SelectorSocketTransport.writelines() method would not pause writing and signal to the Protocol to drain the buffer to the wire once the write buffer reached the high-water mark. Because of this, Protocols would not periodically drain the write buffer potentially leading to memory exhaustion. This vulnerability likely impacts a small number of users, you must be using Python 3.12.0 or later, on macOS or Linux, using the asyncio module with protocols, and using .writelines() method which had new zero-copy-on-write behavior in Python 3.12.0 and later. If not all of these factors are true then your usage of Python is unaffected.",
