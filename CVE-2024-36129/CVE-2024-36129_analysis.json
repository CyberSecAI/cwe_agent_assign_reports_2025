  "description": "The OpenTelemetry Collector offers a vendor-agnostic implementation on how to receive, process and export telemetry data. An **unsafe decompression vulnerability** allows unauthenticated attackers to crash the collector via excessive memory consumption. OTel Collector version 0.102.1 fixes this issue. It is also fixed in the confighttp module version 0.102.0 and configgrpc module version 0.102.1.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from a lack of proper size validation on decompressed data within the OpenTelemetry Collector's HTTP and gRPC receivers. The collector would check the size of the compressed payload but not the resulting uncompressed size, which can be significantly larger.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n\n*   **Unsafe Decompression:** The collector's decompression logic for HTTP and gRPC requests did not limit the size of the decompressed data. This allowed an attacker to send a small, compressed payload that would expand into a large uncompressed payload, consuming excessive memory.\n*   **Missing Size Limits:** Prior to the fix, the `max_request_body_size` parameter in HTTP receivers only applied to the compressed payload, not the decompressed size.\n*   **gRPC zstd vulnerability:** The gRPC implementation did not properly handle zstd compressed payloads, leading to excessive memory consumption.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By sending a \"compressed bomb\" (a small, compressed payload that expands to a large size when decompressed), an attacker could cause the collector to crash due to excessive memory consumption. This would disrupt the entire telemetry collection process.\n*   **Out-of-Memory (OOM) Kill:** The collector application instance could be terminated due to running out of memory when decompressing a malicious payload.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **HTTP:** An attacker sends a specially crafted HTTP request with a compressed payload (gzip, zstd, zlib, snappy, or deflate) to a publicly exposed HTTP receiver endpoint (e.g., OTLP receiver).\n*   **gRPC:** An attacker sends a specially crafted gRPC request with zstd compression to a publicly exposed gRPC receiver endpoint (e.g. OTLP receiver).\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send requests to the collector's exposed HTTP/gRPC port. This usually means the port must be exposed to the public internet or a network segment that the attacker has access to.\n*   **No Authentication (gRPC):** For gRPC, the vulnerability exists before authentication is performed, making it exploitable without valid credentials.\n*   **Authentication (HTTP):** If HTTP authentication is enabled, the attacker needs valid credentials.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n*   The vulnerability affects OpenTelemetry Collector versions 0.102.0 and below for the HTTP receiver, and 0.102.1 and below for the gRPC receiver.\n*   The fixes were implemented in the `confighttp` module (version 0.102.0) and `configgrpc` module (version 0.102.1).\n*   The fix for HTTP involved applying the size limit to the decompressed payload, and the default value for the parameter `max_request_body_size` was established to 20 MiB\n*   The fix for gRPC involved using a custom implementation for zstd decompression and a default limit of 4 MiB was applied.\n*   The issue was discovered during a security audit.\n*   The vulnerability is assigned CVE-2024-36129.\n*   The CVSS score is 8.2 (High).\n*   The vulnerability is classified under CWE-119.\n\nThis detailed analysis should provide a clear understanding of the vulnerability, its potential impact, and how it was addressed.",

The vulnerability description clearly indicates that the OpenTelemetry Collector **lacks proper size validation on decompressed data**, leading to excessive memory consumption. This directly aligns with CWE-770, where a product allocates resources without imposing restrictions.\n\nCWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) is a class-level CWE and a parent of CWE-770, so it is less specific. While the vulnerability does result in uncontrolled resource consumption, the root cause is the missing limits on resource allocation.\n\nCWE-409 (Improper Handling of Highly Compressed Data (Data Amplification)) is related as the vulnerability involves compressed data expanding to a much larger size when decompressed.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe409[\"CWE-409: Improper Handling of Highly Compressed Data (Data Amplification)\"]\n    \n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    cwe770 -->|PEEROF| cwe409\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe770 primary\n    class cwe400,cwe409 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of proper size validation on decompressed data (CWE-770)**, which leads to **excessive memory consumption (CWE-400)**, and can be triggered by **improper handling of highly compressed data (CWE-409)**. The final impact is the crashing of the collector, resulting in a denial-of-service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, especially the **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases** and **CVE Reference Links Content Summary**. The root cause is clearly the **unsafe decompression vulnerability** due to the **missing size limits**, which aligns with CWE-770. The retriever results also list CWE-770 as a potential candidate, further supporting the selection. While other CWEs like CWE-400 and CWE-409 are related, CWE-770 best represents the root cause.\n\nThe selection of CWE-770 is at the optimal level of specificity (Base), as it directly addresses the **allocation of resources without limits or throttling**. The parent CWE (CWE-400) is too general, and the other related CWEs describe contributing factors or impacts rather than the core weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-401: Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently track and release allocated memory after it has been used, which slowly consumes remaining memory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-674: Uncontrolled Recursion\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly control the amount of recursion that takes place,  consuming excessive resources, such as allocated memory or the program stack.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-908: Use of Uninitialized Resource\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.67\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses or accesses a resource that has not been initialized.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.67\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
