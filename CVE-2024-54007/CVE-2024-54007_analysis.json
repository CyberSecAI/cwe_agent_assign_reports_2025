  "description": "Multiple **command injection** vulnerabilities exist in the web interface of the 501 Wireless Client Bridge which could lead to authenticated remote command execution. Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities result in the ability of an attacker to execute arbitrary commands as a privileged user on the underlying operating system. Exploitation requires administrative authentication credentials on the host system.",

The key phrase \"**command injection**\" strongly suggests CWE-77 [Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')] or its more specific child, CWE-78 [Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')]. The retriever results also list CWE-77 as the top combined result and CWE-78 as the second best result. Given the context of the vulnerability description mentioning the ability to execute arbitrary OS commands, CWE-78 is selected as the primary CWE because it is a more specific case of command injection related to the operating system.\n\nCWE-20 [Improper Input Validation] was considered because **command injection** often stems from a lack of proper input validation. However, the description focuses on the **improper neutralization** of special elements, which is more directly addressed by CWE-78. Therefore, CWE-20 is not selected as the primary CWE, but could be considered a prerequisite. Other CWEs such as CWE-89 [Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')] and CWE-94 [Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')] were deemed irrelevant as the vulnerability specifically involves OS commands rather than SQL or general code injection.\n\nThe final selection is based on the direct evidence of **command injection** in the vulnerability description, the retriever results, and the hierarchical relationship between CWE-77 and CWE-78, which favors the more specific base-level CWE-78.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n- Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n  - **weakness:** **command injection**\n  - **impact:** execute arbitrary commands and command execution\n  - **attacker:** authenticated remote attacker\n  - **product:** 501 Wireless Client Bridge\n  - **component:** web interface\n- Retriever Results\n  - CWE-77 [Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')] is the top combined result.\n  - CWE-78 [Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')] is the second best result.",
