# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-54007
## Query
Multiple command injection vulnerabilities exist in the web interface of the 501 Wireless Client Bridge which could lead to authenticated remote command execution. Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities result in the ability of an attacker to execute arbitrary commands as a privileged user on the underlying operating system. Exploitation requires administrative authentication credentials on the host system.

## Keyphrases
- **weakness**: 'command injection'
