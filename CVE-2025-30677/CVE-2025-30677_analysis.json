  "description": "Apache Pulsar contains multiple connectors for integrating with Apache Kafka. The Pulsar IO Apache Kafka Source Connector, Sink Connector, and Kafka Connect Adaptor Sink Connector **log sensitive configuration properties in plain text in application logs**. This vulnerability can lead to unintended exposure of credentials in log files, potentially allowing attackers with access to these logs to obtain Apache Kafka credentials. The vulnerabilitys impact is limited by the fact that an attacker would need access to the application logs to exploit this issue. This issue affects Apache Pulsar IOs Apache Kafka connectors in all versions before 3.0.11, 3.3.6, and 4.0.4. 3.0.x version users should upgrade to at least 3.0.11. 3.3.x version users should upgrade to at least 3.3.6. 4.0.x version users should upgrade to at least 4.0.4. Users operating versions prior to those listed above should upgrade to the aforementioned patched versions or newer versions.",

The vulnerability involves logging sensitive information in plain text. |\n| CWE-319 | Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | The sensitive information is transmitted to the log file in cleartext. |\n| CWE-256 | Plaintext Storage of a Password | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | The credentials are stored in plaintext format. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-532 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File), which directly reflects the vulnerability of logging sensitive information in plaintext. CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information) and CWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password) are related as they describe the mechanism by which the sensitive information is exposed (transmitted in cleartext to the log file and stored in plaintext, respectively). CWE-532 is the root cause, while CWE-319 and CWE-256 further specify the nature of the **weakness**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe532[\"CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File\"]\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe256[\"CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\"]\n    \n    cwe319 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe532\n    cwe256 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe532\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe532 primary\n    class cwe319,cwe256 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **logging of sensitive configuration properties in plain text** (CWE-532). The sensitive information is transmitted in cleartext (CWE-319) and then stored in the logs in plaintext (CWE-256). This leads to the potential exposure of Apache Kafka credentials to attackers who have access to the logs.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and the CVE reference link content summary, which explicitly states that the Pulsar IO Apache Kafka connectors **log sensitive configuration properties in plain text in application logs**.\n\nThe primary CWE, CWE-532, is the most accurate representation of the root cause. The retriever results also strongly suggest CWE-532 as the top candidate.
