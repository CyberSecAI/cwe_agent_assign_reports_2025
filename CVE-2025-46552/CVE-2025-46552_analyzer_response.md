# Raw Analyzer Response for CVE-2025-46552

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-269 | Improper Handling of Authenticated Session | 0.9 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-200 | Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor | 0.7 | Class | Secondary | Discouraged |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE identified is CWE-269, a Base level weakness, which is a child of CWE-288 and CWE-672. It represents an improper handling of authenticated session. The secondary CWE is CWE-200, a Class level weakness, indicating exposure of sensitive information. While CWE-200 is a common consequence, the root cause is the **lack of proper access controls**, meaning the authenticated session was not properly managed, leading to the exposure.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain begins with the **lack of proper access controls**, leading to the improper handling of authenticated session (CWE-269). This, in turn, allowed unauthorized access to specific endpoints, ultimately resulting in the exposure of sensitive user data (CWE-200).

## Summary of Analysis
The vulnerability description clearly points to a **lack of proper access controls** as the root cause, with the subsequent exposure of sensitive information. Based on the retriever results, several CWEs related to authorization and access control were considered, including CWE-863, CWE-285, CWE-287, and CWE-639. However, the most fitting primary CWE is CWE-269 because the vulnerability is focused on an **Improper Handling of Authenticated Session** in which the vulnerability occurred due to user data being exposed in API responses without proper access controls. CWE-200, while relevant as an impact, is discouraged as a primary mapping due to its high-level nature and the availability of more specific root cause CWEs. The chosen CWEs are at the appropriate level of specificity, with CWE-269 at the Base level, representing the direct cause of the vulnerability.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-359: Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.67
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly prevent a person's private, personal information from being accessed by actors who either (1) are not explicitly authorized to access the information or (2) do not have the implicit consent of the person about whom the information is collected.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.67
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.67
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.67
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.



## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.66
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-214: Invocation of Process Using Visible Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.66
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A process is invoked with sensitive command-line arguments, environment variables, or other elements that can be seen by other processes on the operating system.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.66
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-285: Improper Authorization
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 419.84
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.
