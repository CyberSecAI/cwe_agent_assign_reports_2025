  "description": "KHC-INVITATION-AUTOMATION is a GitHub automation script that automatically invites followers of a bot account to join your organization. In some commits on version 1.2, a vulnerability was identified where user data, including email addresses and Discord usernames, were exposed in API responses without proper access controls. This allowed unauthorized users to access sensitive user information by directly calling specific endpoints. This issue has been patched in a later commit on version 1.2.",

It represents an improper handling of authenticated session. The secondary CWE is CWE-200, a Class level weakness, indicating exposure of sensitive information. While CWE-200 is a common consequence, the root cause is the **lack of proper access controls**, meaning the authenticated session was not properly managed, leading to the exposure.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe269[\"CWE-269: Improper Handling of Authenticated Session\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe288[\"CWE-288: Authentication Bypass\"]\n    cwe672[\"CWE-672: Operation on a Resource Without Holding a Critical Lock\"]\n\n    cwe269 -->|CHILDOF| cwe288\n    cwe269 -->|CHILDOF| cwe672\n    cwe269 -->|CAN_LEAD_TO| cwe200\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe269 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n    class cwe288,cwe672 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the **lack of proper access controls**, leading to the improper handling of authenticated session (CWE-269). This, in turn, allowed unauthorized access to specific endpoints, ultimately resulting in the exposure of sensitive user data (CWE-200).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly points to a **lack of proper access controls** as the root cause, with the subsequent exposure of sensitive information. Based on the retriever results, several CWEs related to authorization and access control were considered, including CWE-863, CWE-285, CWE-287, and CWE-639. However, the most fitting primary CWE is CWE-269 because the vulnerability is focused on an **Improper Handling of Authenticated Session** in which the vulnerability occurred due to user data being exposed in API responses without proper access controls. CWE-200, while relevant as an impact, is discouraged as a primary mapping due to its high-level nature and the availability of more specific root cause CWEs. The chosen CWEs are at the appropriate level of specificity, with CWE-269 at the Base level, representing the direct cause of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25

externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.66\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a
