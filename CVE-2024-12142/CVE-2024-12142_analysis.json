While CWE-200 is discouraged as it's a high-level impact, the provided vulnerability description and CVE summary explicitly state this CWE as the root cause, justifying its selection. CWE-425 and CWE-306 are included as potential contributing factors.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe425[\"CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n\n    cwe425 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe200\n    cwe306 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe200\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe425,cwe306 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with potentially **missing authentication (CWE-306)** or **improper authorization (CWE-425)**, leading to the **exposure of sensitive information (CWE-200)**. The impact includes information disclosure, web page modification, and denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary classification is CWE-200 based on the explicit mention in the vulnerability description and CVE summary, despite it being a discouraged, high-level Class. The evidence is strong due to the direct statement of CWE-200 as the identified **weakness**. While the description mentions potential contributing factors like unauthorized access to restricted functions, the core issue identified is the exposure of sensitive information. The selection of CWE-200 is at the appropriate level of specificity, given the information provided.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.82\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-200 is commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error. As of CWE 4.9, over 400 CWE entries can lead to a loss of confidentiality. Other options are often available.
