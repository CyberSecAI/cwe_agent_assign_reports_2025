## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2024-12142 Content

This content is **RELEVANT** to CVE-2024-12142. Here's an extraction of the vulnerability information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   The vulnerability allows for information disclosure of restricted web pages, modification of web pages, and denial of service when specific web pages are modified and restricted functions are invoked.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Information disclosure on web pages.
*   Modification of web pages.
*   Denial of service, potentially leading to unavailability of controllers or modules.

**Attack vectors:**

*   Modification of specific web pages.
*   Invocation of restricted functions.
*   Unauthorized access to FTP port 21/TCP (if mitigations are not applied).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   No authentication required (PR:N in CVSS).
*   Network access (AV:N in CVSS).
*   Low complexity attack (AC:L in CVSS).

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   **BMXNOR0200H:** Upgrade to version SV1.70IR26 (available at [https://www.se.com/ww/en/download/document/BMXNOR0200H_FW/](https://www.se.com/ww/en/download/document/BMXNOR0200H_FW/)).
*   **Modicon M340, BMXNOE0100, BMXNOE0110:** Schneider Electric is developing a remediation plan for future versions.  Until then, apply the following mitigations:
    *   Set up network segmentation and implement a firewall to block unauthorized access to FTP port 21/TCP.
    *   Disable FTP service via EcoStruxureTM Control Expert.
    *   Disable Web server service via EcoStruxureTM Control Expert.
    *   Configure the Access Control List following the recommendation on the “Modicon Controllers System Cybersecurity” documentation.

**CVSS Scores:**

*   CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 8.6 (High) - CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:H
