  "query": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ax25 Fix refcount imbalance on inbound connections When releasing a socket in ax25_release(), we call netdev_put() to decrease the refcount on the associated ax.25 device. However, the execution path for accepting an incoming connection never calls netdev_hold(). This imbalance leads to refcount errors, and ultimately to kernel crashes. A typical call trace for the above situation will start with one of the following errors refcount_t decrement hit 0 leaking memory. refcount_t underflow use-after-free. And will then have a trace like Call Trace ? show_regs+0x64/0x70 ? __warn+0x83/0x120 ? refcount_warn_saturate+0xb2/0x100 ? report_bug+0x158/0x190 ? prb_read_valid+0x20/0x30 ? handle_bug+0x3e/0x70 ? exc_invalid_op+0x1c/0x70 ? asm_exc_invalid_op+0x1f/0x30 ? refcount_warn_saturate+0xb2/0x100 ? refcount_warn_saturate+0xb2/0x100 ax25_release+0x2ad/0x360 __sock_release+0x35/0xa0 sock_close+0x19/0x20 [...] On reboot (or any attempt to remove the interface), the kernel gets stuck in an infinite loop unregister_netdevice waiting for ax0 to become free. Usage count = 0 This patch corrects these issues by ensuring that we call netdev_hold() and ax25_dev_hold() for new connections in ax25_accept(). This makes the logic leading to ax25_accept() match the logic for ax25_bind() in both cases we increment the refcount, which",
