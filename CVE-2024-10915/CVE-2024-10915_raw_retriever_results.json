Affected by this issue is the function cgi_user_add of the file /cgi-bin/account_mgr.cgi?cmd=cgi_user_add. The manipulation of the argument group leads to os command injection. The attack may be launched remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation is known to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.",
