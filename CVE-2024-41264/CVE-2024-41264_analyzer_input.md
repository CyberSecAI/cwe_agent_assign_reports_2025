# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-41264

## Vulnerability Description
An issue discovered in casdoor v1.636.0 allows attackers to obtain sensitive information via the ssh.**InsecureIgnoreHostKey() method**.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **InsecureIgnoreHostKey() method**
- **impact:** obtain sensitive information
- **attacker:** attackers
- **product:** casdoor
- **version:** v1.636.0

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content is related to CVE-2024-41264.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of `ssh.InsecureIgnoreHostKey()` in `casdoor/casdoor/object/viaSSHDialer.go` when establishing SSH connections. This method disables host key verification, meaning the application does not check if the host key received from the server matches the expected key.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper validation of the SSH host key, specifically the use of `InsecureIgnoreHostKey()`.
- This bypasses the expected security mechanism to prevent man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.
- The vulnerability is categorized as CWE-297: Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Allows attackers to perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.
- Attackers can intercept and potentially modify communication between the Casdoor application and a backend database (MySQL, Postgres, or MSSQL).
- This can lead to information disclosure, allowing attackers to obtain sensitive data transmitted over the SSH connection, such as database credentials or queries.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploitable remotely.
- An attacker would need to be positioned in a way to intercept network traffic between the Casdoor application and the target database server, likely by controlling part of the network path.
- The vulnerability is exposed when Casdoor uses SSH to connect to database servers (MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MSSQL).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to intercept or redirect network traffic between the Casdoor server and a database server being accessed via an SSH tunnel set up by Casdoor.
- The attacker does not need to have valid credentials, they only need to be able to intercept communication.

**Additional details:**
- The affected product is Casdoor, specifically versions up to and including 1.636.0.
- The affected component is the SSHDialer.
