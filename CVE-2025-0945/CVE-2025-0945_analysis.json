Here's the extracted information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nA GET SQL injection vulnerability was found due to the direct use of parameters (\"id\", \"expid\", \"incid\", \"typeid\", or \"staffid\") in SQL queries without proper sanitization or validation.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\nGET type SQL injection.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\nAttackers can achieve unauthorized database access, sensitive data leakage, data tampering, comprehensive system control, and even service interruption.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\nExploitation occurs through GET requests to vulnerable PHP files (deldoc.php, customerview.php, typedelete.php, templatedelete.php, expview.php, incview.php, partview.php, staffview.php) with manipulated \"id\", \"expid\", \"incid\", \"typeid\", or \"staffid\" parameters.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\nAn attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable application. No authentication is explicitly mentioned as being required.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n1. Use prepared statements and parameter binding.\n2. Input validation and filtering.\n3. Minimize database user permissions.\n4. Regular security audits.\n\n**Additional details (more than official CVE description):**\n*   Specific vulnerable files are identified.\n*   Payload examples for time-based blind SQL injection are provided.\n*   SQLmap commands used for testing are included.\n*   The affected product is \"Tailoring Management System Project In PHP With Source Code\" version 1.0.\n*   A link to the vulnerable software is provided.",
