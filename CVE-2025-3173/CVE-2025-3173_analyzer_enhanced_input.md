## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-3173 Content

This content **RELATES** to a vulnerability, but it's a report *about* a vulnerability, not the official CVE description itself. It provides more detail than a typical CVE description would.

Here's the extracted information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   A SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `/save_booking.php` file of the 'Time Table Generator' project.
*   The root cause is the direct use of the `lawyer_id` parameter in SQL queries without proper cleaning or validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   SQL Injection

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Unauthorized database access
*   Sensitive data leakage
*   Data tampering
*   Comprehensive system control
*   Service interruption

**Attack vectors:**

*   The `lawyer_id` parameter in a POST request to `/save_booking.php` is vulnerable.
*   No login or authorization is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to send a crafted POST request to the vulnerable endpoint. No authentication is required.
*   Knowledge of SQL injection techniques and payloads is necessary.

**Mitigation or fix:**

1.  **Use prepared statements and parameter binding:** This separates SQL code from user input.
2.  **Input validation and filtering:**  Ensure user input conforms to the expected format.
3.  **Minimize database user permissions:** Use accounts with the minimum necessary permissions.
4.  **Regular security audits:** Conduct regular code and system security audits.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Product:** Time Table Generator System using PHP and MySQL
*   **Vendor Homepage:** <https://phpgurukul.com/time-table-generator-system-using-php-and-mysql/>
*   **Vulnerable File:** `/save_booking.php`
*   **Version:** V1.0
*   **Software Link:** <https://phpgurukul.com/?sdm_process_download=1&download_id=20293>
*   **Payload Examples:** The report includes several SQLmap payloads for boolean-based blind, error-based, and time-based blind SQL injection attacks.
*   **POC:** A screenshot of a SQLmap scan is provided.
