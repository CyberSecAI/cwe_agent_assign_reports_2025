The ability to \"execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system\" was then considered, suggesting a potential command injection vulnerability. This led to the inclusion of CWE-78 as a secondary weakness.\n\nThe selection of CWE-285 is based on the explicit mention of \"**insufficient authorization**\" in the vulnerability description key phrases.
