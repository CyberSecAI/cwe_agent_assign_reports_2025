# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-10020

## Vulnerability Description
The Heateor Social Login WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to **authentication bypass** in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.35. This is due to **insufficient verification on the user being returned by the social login token**. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user on the site, if they have access to the email and the user does not have an already-existing account for the service returning the token. An attacker cannot authenticate as an administrator by default, but these accounts are also at risk if authentication for administrators has explicitly been allowed via the social login.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **insufficient verification on the user being returned by the social login token**
- **weakness:** **authentication bypass**
- **impact:** log in as any existing user on the site
- **attacker:** unauthenticated attackers
- **product:** Heateor Social Login WordPress plugin
- **version:** all versions up to and including 1.1.35

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient verification of the user data returned by social login tokens. Specifically, the plugin does not properly verify if the user is the actual owner of the account being used for social login.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Improper Authentication:** The core weakness is the lack of proper authentication checks, allowing an attacker to bypass the intended login process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Authentication Bypass:** An unauthenticated attacker can log in as any existing user on the site if they have access to the email and the user does not have an existing account for the service returning the token.
*   **Account Takeover:** Attackers can gain complete access to existing user accounts.
*   **Potential Privilege Escalation:** While not default, If social login is explicitly enabled for administrators, it can lead to full site compromise

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Social Login Mechanism:** Exploits the social login functionality of the plugin.
*   **Email Address:** Requires knowledge of the target user's email address.
*   **Lack of Account Association:** The vulnerability works when there is no existing account linked to the social login provider on the WordPress site.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to have an account on the target WordPress site.
*   **Email Address:** The attacker needs to know the email address of the target user
*   **Social Login:** Requires that the WordPress site utilizes the social login feature of the vulnerable plugin

**Additional Details**
* The vulnerability was present in versions up to and including 1.1.35 of the "Heateor Social Login" WordPress plugin.
* The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.1.36
* The fix includes preventing the plugin from fetching email and other user profile data for Disqus and Spotify accounts as they cannot be verified. It also implements a check to ensure that Vkontakte accounts are verified and restricts redirects to only within the website domain.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control

**Authentication**:
Determines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.

* Example phrases: "user must log in", "lack of login check", "bypasses login"
* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.

  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* – used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).

**Authorization**:
Determines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do. It decides access *after* identity is verified.

* Example phrases: "unauthorized access", "regular user can access admin panel", "role checks are missing"
* CWE relevance: use CWEs like 862, 863, 285 for authorization errors:

  * **CWE-862**: *Missing Authorization* – the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all.
  * **CWE-863**: *Incorrect Authorization* – the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).
  * **CWE-285**: *Improper Authorization* – general category for any flawed authorization logic or design.

**Access Control**:
A broader term that includes both authentication and authorization. Governs how resources are protected and who can access them under what conditions.

* CWE relevance:

  * **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* – top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear.
  * This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.

## Mapping Discussion – Common Misclassification Patterns

### 1. **CWE-306 vs CWE-862**:

* **306** is about lack of **authentication** (e.g., *no login required at all*).
* **862** is about lack of **authorization** *after* authentication (e.g., *admin check missing*).
* ✅ Example CWE-306: *“An unauthenticated attacker can invoke the password reset API.”*
* ✅ Example CWE-862: *“An authenticated user without admin privileges can delete any user account.”*

### 2. **CWE-285 vs CWE-284**:

* **285** is specific to authorization flaws – it's a better choice than 284 **if** the issue involves *improper or missing role checks*.
* **284** should be reserved for general access control issues when it’s unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.

---

## Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification

**Phrase like "unauthorized access" is not enough.**

* If you **cannot determine whether identity was checked**, assume it’s **authorization** and consider 862 or 863.
* If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** → CWE-306.
* If the **access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced**, but it's not due to missing checks, consider **CWE-284**.

---

## Good Mapping Examples

* ✅ **CWE-306**: “The endpoint `/admin/deleteUser` does not require any authentication.”
* ✅ **CWE-862**: “Any logged-in user can change any other user's email without being an admin.”
* ✅ **CWE-863**: “An admin check exists but incorrectly grants access to non-admin users.”
* ✅ **CWE-285**: “Application uses a static role check that fails when roles change dynamically.”
* ✅ **CWE-284**: “Inconsistent enforcement of access rules across services with unclear policy source.”

| **Indicator**                                              | **Likely CWE** |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| No identity check (no login)                               | CWE-306        |
| No role/privilege check after login                        | CWE-862        |
| Role check is present but flawed                           | CWE-863        |
| General or ambiguous authorization failure                 | CWE-285        |
| High-level access control problem with no clear root cause | CWE-284        |
