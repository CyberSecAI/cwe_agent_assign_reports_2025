Verify if the content relates to the CVE specified based on the official description**\\n\\nThe content from the website mentions the plugin eMagicOne Store Manager for WooCommerce and describes an Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Read vulnerability. This aligns with the CVE-2025-4602 description.\\n\\n**2. If the content does not relate to this CVE, respond with \"UNRELATED\"**\\n**3.

The authentication mechanism relies on a default credential pair (`login=1`, `password=1`) and a session key system.\\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\\n    *   Default credentials are used.\\n    *   Session key system.\\n*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can read arbitrary files from the WordPress root or any accessible directory. This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, such as database credentials (e.g., in `wp-config.php`).\\n*   **Attack vectors:**\\n    *   Send a POST request to the `?connector=bridge` endpoint with the default credentials and task.\\n    *   Obtain a session key.\\n    *   Use the session key to read arbitrary files.\\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**\\n    *   Network access to the vulnerable WordPress site.\\n    *   Knowledge of the `?connector=bridge` endpoint.\\n*   **Reproduction:** A POC [CVE-2025-4602.py](https://github.com/d0n601/CVE-2025-4602/blob/master/CVE-2025-4602.py) is provided to demonstrate reading the `wp-config.php` file from the server.\\n*   **Relevant code:**\\n    *   `classes/class-emosmconnectorcommon.php` (lines ~441-525): `private function check_auth() { ... }`\\n    *   `classes/class-emosmconnectorcommon.php` (lines ~2219+): `private function get_file() { ... }`\\n    *   `classes/class-emosmcwoocommerceoverrider.php` (lines ~380+): `public function delete_image( $entity_type, $image_id ) { ... }`\\n*   **Fix:** The vulnerability can be mitigated by changing the default credentials and disabling the `connector=bridge` endpoint if it is not needed. A code review and security audit are recommended.\\n\\n**Additional detail compared to the official CVE description:** The content provides a detailed technical explanation of the vulnerability, including the vulnerable code, the attack vector, and a proof of concept (POC).

This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to read the contents of arbitrary files on the server, which can contain sensitive information. This is only exploitable by unauthenticated attackers in **default configurations** where the the **default password** is left as 11, or where the attacker gains access to the credentials.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'unauthenticated access to the get_file() function'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1.
