# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2025-21767

## Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved clocksource Use migrate_disable() to avoid calling get_random_u32() in atomic context The following bug report happened with a PREEMPT_RT kernel BUG **sleeping function called from invalid context** at kernel/locking/spinlock_rt.c48 in_atomic() 1, irqs_disabled() 0, non_block 0, pid 2012, name kwatchdog preempt_count 1, expected 0 RCU nest depth 0, expected 0 get_random_u32+0x4f/0x110 clocksource_verify_choose_cpus+0xab/0x1a0 clocksource_verify_percpu.part.0+0x6b/0x330 clocksource_watchdog_kthread+0x193/0x1a0 It is due to the fact that clocksource_verify_choose_cpus() is invoked with preemption disabled. This function invokes get_random_u32() to obtain random numbers for choosing CPUs. The batched_entropy_32 local lock and/or the base_crng.lock spinlock in driver/char/random.c will be acquired during the call. In PREEMPT_RT kernel, they are both sleeping locks and so **cannot be acquired in atomic context**. Fix this problem by using migrate_disable() to allow smp_processor_id() to be reliably used without introducing atomic context. preempt_disable() is then called after clocksource_verify_choose_cpus() but before the clocksource measurement is being run to avoid introducing unexpected latency.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Rootcause:** sleeping function called from invalid context
- **Weakness:** cannot be acquired in atomic context
- **Impact:** kernel BUG
- **Product:** Linux kernel

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-667 | Improper Locking | 0.85 | Class | Primary CWE | Allowed-with-Review |
| CWE-362 | Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') | 0.70 | Class | Secondary Candidate | Allowed-with-Review |
| CWE-367 | Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition | 0.60 | Base | Secondary Candidate | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.80
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE identified is CWE-667 (Improper Locking), a Class-level CWE. The vulnerability description indicates that a **sleeping function is called from an invalid context** because locks **cannot be acquired in atomic context**. This directly relates to improper locking mechanisms. CWE-362 (Race Condition) is a related Class-level CWE, as improper locking often leads to race conditions. CWE-367 (TOCTOU) is a Base-level CWE and a child of CWE-362. These relationships highlight a potential chain where improper locking (CWE-667) could contribute to race conditions (CWE-362), and in specific scenarios, TOCTOU vulnerabilities (CWE-367).

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **root cause** of **improper locking (CWE-667)** due to calling `get_random_u32()` in an atomic context, where sleeping locks are acquired. This leads to a kernel bug because the locks **cannot be acquired in atomic context**. This can cause a race condition scenario **(CWE-362)**.

## Summary of Analysis
The assessment is based on the provided evidence, specifically the phrases "**sleeping function called from invalid context**" and "**cannot be acquired in atomic context**." The Retriever Results also support CWE-667 as the top candidate.

The graph relationships show how improper locking can lead to race conditions and potentially TOCTOU vulnerabilities.

CWE-667 is selected as the primary CWE because it directly addresses the **root cause** of the locking issue. While CWE-362 and CWE-367 are related and potentially present, CWE-667 represents the initial flaw that triggers the subsequent issues.

The level of specificity is appropriate, as CWE-667 is a Class-level CWE that captures the general issue of improper locking. Lower-level CWEs could be considered if more specific information about the locking mechanism was available, but the current evidence points to a general locking problem.

Relevant CWE Information:
CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write), CWE-415 (Double Free), and CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) were considered but deemed less relevant as the vulnerability description does not provide evidence of memory corruption or arithmetic errors.
