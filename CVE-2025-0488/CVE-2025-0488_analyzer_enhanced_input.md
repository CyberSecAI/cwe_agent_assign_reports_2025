## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-0488 Content

The provided content **IS RELATED** to a vulnerability. It details a SQL injection vulnerability in the `product_list.php` file of the `native-php-cms` project on GitHub.

Here's a breakdown of the extracted information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The input `cat` parameter in `product_list.php` is not filtered, allowing for error-based SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   SQL Injection

**Impact of exploitation:**

The attacker can inject data, potentially allowing them to extract information from the database (as demonstrated by the example payload attempting to extract the user).

**Attack vectors:**

*   HTTP request with a malicious `cat` parameter.  The example provided uses: `http://192.168.0.104/product_list.php?cat=extractvalue(1,concat(0x5c,user(),0x5c))`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable `product_list.php` endpoint. No authentication is required based on the provided information.

**Mitigation or fix:**

The content does not provide a specific fix, but implies that proper input validation and sanitization of the `cat` parameter are required to prevent the SQL injection vulnerability.

**Additional Details (compared to a hypothetical CVE description):**

The provided content offers significantly more detail than a typical CVE description would. It includes:

*   The specific file and parameter vulnerable (`product_list.php`, `cat`).
*   A proof-of-concept exploit payload.
*   A demonstration of how the vulnerability can be exploited to extract information (user).
*   A specific example URL.
