## Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved usb xhci **Apply the link chain quirk on NEC isoc endpoints** Two clearly different specimens of NEC uPD720200 (one with start/stop bug, one without) were seen to cause IOMMU faults after some Missed Service Errors. Faulting address is immediately after a transfer ring segment and patched dynamic debug messages revealed that the MSE was received when waiting for a TD near the end of that segment [ 1.041954] xhci_hcd Miss service interval error for slot 1 ep 2 expected TD DMA ffa08fe0 [ 1.042120] xhci_hcd AMD-Vi Event logged [IO_PAGE_FAULT domain=0x0005 address=0xffa09000 flags=0x0000] [ 1.042146] xhci_hcd AMD-Vi Event logged [IO_PAGE_FAULT domain=0x0005 address=0xffa09040 flags=0x0000] It gets even funnier if the next page is a ring segment accessible to the HC. Below, it reports MSE in segment at ff1e8000, plows through a zero-filled page at ff1e9000 and starts reporting events for TRBs in page at ff1ea000 every microframe, instead of jumping to seg ff1e6000.

Lastly, an error from a different USB device on another HC. Was it caused by the above? I dont know, but it may have been. The disk was working without any other issues and generated PCIe traffic to starve the NEC of upstream BW and trigger those MSEs. The two HCs shared one x1 slot by means of a commercial PCIe splitter board.

Other ancient HCs are known which also expect the bit to be set and they ignore Link TRBs if its not. Reportedly, 0.95 spec guaranteed that the bit is set. The bandwidth-starved NEC HC running a 32KB/uframe UVC endpoint reports tens of MSEs per second and runs into the bug within seconds. Chaining Link TRBs allows the same workload to run for many minutes, many times. No ne ---truncated---

## Vulnerability Chain

The vulnerability chain starts with the improper handling of link chain quirks on NEC isoc endpoints, leading to memory corruption due to out-of-bounds write, and ultimately resulting in IOMMU faults and system instability.

## Summary of Analysis

The analysis identifies CWE-787 as the primary weakness due to the out-of-bounds write condition, evidenced by the "buffer overrun event" and "Transfer event TRB DMA ptr not part of current TD" messages. The description clearly points to data being written to unintended memory locations.

The decision is based on the vulnerability description stating that the issue is avoided by setting the chain bit of Link TRBs on isochronous rings. When this bit is not set correctly, the system experiences "buffer overrun event" and "Transfer event TRB DMA ptr not part of current TD," indicating that data is being written to memory locations outside the intended buffer.
