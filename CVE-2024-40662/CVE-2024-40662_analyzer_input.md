# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-40662

## Vulnerability Description
In scheme of Uri.java, there is a possible way to craft a malformed Uri object due to **improper input validation**. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **improper input validation**
- **impact:** local escalation of privilege
- **vector:** malformed Uri object
- **component:** scheme of Uri.java

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2024-40662:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability lies in the `android.net.Uri` class, specifically within the `scheme(String scheme)` method of the `Uri.Builder`.
- The code doesn't properly sanitize the URI scheme string. It only removes "://", which can be bypassed to inject malicious schemas.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Improper Input Sanitization:** The code attempts to sanitize the URI scheme by removing the "://" delimiter. However, this is insufficient as it does not prevent injection of malicious schema components.
- **Scheme Injection:** By crafting a scheme string with multiple "://" instances or with a malicious payload embedded within it, an attacker can inject a malicious scheme into a URI object.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Elevation of Privilege (EoP):** The vulnerability is categorized as an Elevation of Privilege (EoP), meaning successful exploitation could allow an attacker to gain higher privileges than they should normally have.
- The specific way this could lead to EoP is not detailed in the provided context but is implied given the severity rating of "High".

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local:** The provided details suggest the attack is local, meaning the attacker needs to have some level of access to the device to exploit the vulnerability. This is likely through a malicious application.
- **Malicious URI crafting:** The attacker crafts a URI with a malicious scheme string, then uses that URI via any function that parses URIs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local access:** The attacker needs to be able to execute code on the device. This is likely through a malicious application that can manipulate URI objects.
- **Ability to construct malicious URI strings:** The attacker needs to understand how to craft a URI string that bypasses the insufficient sanitization in the `scheme()` method.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided commit message clarifies that the original approach of removing all unsupported characters was abandoned to avoid breaking apps that use custom schemes with asterisks.
- The fix is to simply remove the "://" string from the scheme part of the URI.
- The provided test case in the patch shows that "http://https://evil.com:/te:st/" will result in scheme "httphttpsevil.com:/te:st/".

**In summary, CVE-2024-40662 arises from insufficient input sanitization when setting the URI scheme, allowing for the injection of a malicious scheme, which could lead to an elevation of privilege.**

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* 🔍 *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* 🔍 *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion – CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### 🔸 CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ✅ *“A user created with the ‘guest’ role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ✅ *“The backup service runs as root but only needs read access.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ⚠️ This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### 🔸 CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ✅ *“User can access another user’s invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.”*

## Mapping Examples – Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *“User can escalate privileges to admin.”*
> ❌ Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged – only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ✅ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**

## Good Mapping Examples – Privileges & Permissions

* ✅ **CWE-266**: *“When a new user registers, the system assigns them admin role due to a missing role validation.”*
* ✅ **CWE-250**: *“Installer runs with system-level privileges but doesn't require them to install files in the user directory.”*
* ✅ **CWE-284**: *“Inconsistent access rules between UI and backend for sensitive endpoints.”*
* ✅ **CWE-285**: *“Authorization logic fails to restrict access to finance reports based on department.”*
