  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2024-40662:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n\n- The vulnerability lies in the `android.net.Uri` class, specifically within the `scheme(String scheme)` method of the `Uri.Builder`.\n- The code doesn't properly sanitize the URI scheme string. It only removes \"://\", which can be bypassed to inject malicious schemas.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n\n- **Improper Input Sanitization:** The code attempts to sanitize the URI scheme by removing the \"://\" delimiter. However, this is insufficient as it does not prevent injection of malicious schema components.\n- **Scheme Injection:** By crafting a scheme string with multiple \"://\" instances or with a malicious payload embedded within it, an attacker can inject a malicious scheme into a URI object.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n- **Elevation of Privilege (EoP):** The vulnerability is categorized as an Elevation of Privilege (EoP), meaning successful exploitation could allow an attacker to gain higher privileges than they should normally have.\n- The specific way this could lead to EoP is not detailed in the provided context but is implied given the severity rating of \"High\".\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n- **Local:** The provided details suggest the attack is local, meaning the attacker needs to have some level of access to the device to exploit the vulnerability. This is likely through a malicious application.\n- **Malicious URI crafting:** The attacker crafts a URI with a malicious scheme string, then uses that URI via any function that parses URIs.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n- **Local access:** The attacker needs to be able to execute code on the device. This is likely through a malicious application that can manipulate URI objects.\n- **Ability to construct malicious URI strings:** The attacker needs to understand how to craft a URI string that bypasses the insufficient sanitization in the `scheme()` method.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n- The provided commit message clarifies that the original approach of removing all unsupported characters was abandoned to avoid breaking apps that use custom schemes with asterisks.\n- The fix is to simply remove the \"://\" string from the scheme part of the URI.\n- The provided test case in the patch shows that \"http://https://evil.com:/te:st/\" will result in scheme \"httphttpsevil.com:/te:st/\".\n\n**In summary, CVE-2024-40662 arises from insufficient input sanitization when setting the URI scheme, allowing for the injection of a malicious scheme, which could lead to an elevation of privilege.**",
