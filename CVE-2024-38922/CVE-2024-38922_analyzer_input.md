## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
```
{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a missing check for NaN values in the input message's covariance matrix, which can lead to a stack buffer overflow during the eigen decomposition calculation within the `pf_matrix_unitary` function.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "Stack buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability can cause a stack buffer overflow in `nav2_amcl`, leading to the termination of the process, which would halt the robot's localization capability.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Publishing a crafted `PoseWithCovarianceStamped` message with NaN values in the covariance matrix to the `/initialpose` topic."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to publish messages to the `/initialpose` topic."
