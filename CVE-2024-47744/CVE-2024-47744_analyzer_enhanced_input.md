- **component:** KVM

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, the content relates to **CVE-2024-47744**.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a potential deadlock in the KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) subsystem of the Linux kernel on x86 architectures. The deadlock occurs due to a complex interaction of multiple locks, including `kvm->slots_lock`, `vcpu->mutex`, `kvm->srcu`, `cpu_hotplug_lock`, and `kvm_lock`. Specifically, the `kvm_usage_count` was previously protected by `kvm_lock`, leading to the deadlock when CPU hotplug operations interact with other KVM operations that also take these locks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Circular locking dependency**: A circular dependency occurs when threads try to acquire locks in an order that creates a cycle, leading to a deadlock.
- **Improper lock ordering**: The original implementation had `cpus_read_lock()` being taken outside of `kvm_lock` which could cause a deadlock.
- **Use of shared locks for unrelated resources**: The `kvm_lock` was used for both `kvm_usage_count` and other operations, causing contention and potential deadlocks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Deadlock:** The primary impact is a system deadlock, where the kernel becomes unresponsive, requiring a reboot to recover. This can lead to denial of service.
- **Unpredictable behavior:** The interaction between CPU hotplug, VM operations and the locking issues can cause unpredictable behavior and system instability.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Specific KVM operations:** Triggering the deadlock requires specific KVM operations such as modifying memory slots (memslots), setting MSRs (Model Specific Registers), or using NX huge pages.
- **CPU hotplug**: The vulnerability involves contention with the `cpu_hotplug_lock` so triggering CPU online/offline events are part of the attack vector.
- **Timing:** The deadlock is sensitive to timing, requiring the right sequence of operations and lock acquisitions to manifest.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Privileged access:** The attacker would need the ability to perform KVM operations, typically requiring root or specific virtualization privileges.
- **Specific VM configuration:** The specific VM configuration, such as the use of NX huge pages and older CPUs without a constant TSC, increases the likelihood of triggering the deadlock.
- **Control over CPU hotplug:** The attacker would need to have control over CPU online/offline events to trigger the lock contention involved in the deadlock.

**Additional details:**
- The provided patches introduce a dedicated mutex, `kvm_usage_lock`, to protect the `kvm_usage_count`.
- The patches also add comments in the locking documentation to highlight the issues of taking `cpus_read_lock()` outside of `kvm_lock` and walking the vm\_list.
- The fix addresses the most blatant deadlock issue with the use of a dedicated mutex instead of using a single mutex for multiple resources.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-667: Improper Locking
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.

### Extended Description


Locking is a type of synchronization behavior that ensures that multiple independently-operating processes or threads do not interfere with each other when accessing the same resource. All processes/threads are expected to follow the same steps for locking. If these steps are not followed precisely - or if no locking is done at all - then another process/thread could modify the shared resource in a way that is not visible or predictable to the original process. This can lead to data or memory corruption, denial of service, etc.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**

- **CVE-2009-2857:** OS deadlock
- **CVE-2009-1961:** OS deadlock involving 3 separate functions




## CWE-412: Unrestricted Externally Accessible Lock
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product properly checks for the existence of a lock, but the lock can be externally controlled or influenced by an actor that is outside of the intended sphere of control.

### Extended Description
This prevents the product from acting on associated resources or performing other behaviors that are controlled by the presence of the lock. Relevant locks might include an exclusive lock or mutex, or modifying a shared resource that is treated as a lock. If the lock can be held for an indefinite period of time, then the denial of service could be permanent.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships

### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This overlaps Insufficient Resource Pool when the "pool" is of size 1. It can also be resultant from race conditions, although the timing window could be quite large in some cases.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2001-0682:** Program can not execute when attacker obtains a mutex.
- **CVE-2002-1914:** Program can not execute when attacker obtains a lock on a critical output file.
- **CVE-2002-1915:** Program can not execute when attacker obtains a lock on a critical output file.




## CWE-764: Multiple Locks of a Critical Resource
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product locks a critical resource more times than intended, leading to an unexpected state in the system.

### Extended Description
When a product is operating in a concurrent environment and repeatedly locks a critical resource, the consequences will vary based on the type of lock, the lock's implementation, and the resource being protected. In some situations such as with semaphores, the resources are pooled and extra locking calls will reduce the size of the total available pool, possibly leading to degraded performance or a denial of service. If this can be triggered by an attacker, it will be similar to an unrestricted lock (CWE-412). In the context of a binary lock, it is likely that any duplicate locking attempts will never succeed since the lock is already held and progress may not be possible.

### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** An alternate way to think about this weakness is as an imbalance between the number of locks / unlocks in the control flow. Over the course of execution, if each lock call is not followed by a subsequent call to unlock in a reasonable amount of time, then system performance may be degraded or at least operating at less than peak levels if there is competition for the locks. This entry may need to be modified to reflect these concepts in the future.






## CWE-765: Multiple Unlocks of a Critical Resource
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product unlocks a critical resource more times than intended, leading to an unexpected state in the system.

### Extended Description
When the product is operating in a concurrent environment and repeatedly unlocks a critical resource, the consequences will vary based on the type of lock, the lock's implementation, and the resource being protected. In some situations such as with semaphores, the resources are pooled and extra calls to unlock will increase the count for the number of available resources, likely resulting in a crash or unpredictable behavior when the system nears capacity.

## CWE-413: Improper Resource Locking
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not lock or does not correctly lock a resource when the product must have exclusive access to the resource.

### Extended Description
When a resource is not properly locked, an attacker could modify the resource while it is being operated on by the product. This might violate the product's assumption that the resource will not change, potentially leading to unexpected behaviors.

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-20141:** Chain: an operating system kernel has insufficent resource locking (CWE-413) leading to a use after free (CWE-416).




## CWE-416: Use After Free
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product reuses or references memory after it has been freed. At some point afterward, the memory may be allocated again and saved in another pointer, while the original pointer references a location somewhere within the new allocation. Any operations using the original pointer are no longer valid because the memory "belongs" to the code that operates on the new pointer.

- **CVE-2021-0920:** Chain: mobile platform race condition (CWE-362) leading to use-after-free (CWE-416), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.




## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.

### Extended Description


A race condition occurs within concurrent environments, and it is effectively a property of a code sequence. Depending on the context, a code sequence may be in the form of a function call, a small number of instructions, a series of program invocations, etc.


A race condition violates these properties, which are closely related:


  - Exclusivity - the code sequence is given exclusive access to the shared resource, i.e., no other code sequence can modify properties of the shared resource before the original sequence has completed execution.

  - Atomicity - the code sequence is behaviorally atomic, i.e., no other thread or process can concurrently execute the same sequence of instructions (or a subset) against the same resource.

A race condition exists when an "interfering code sequence" can still access the shared resource, violating exclusivity.

The interfering code sequence could be "trusted" or "untrusted." A trusted interfering code sequence occurs within the product; it cannot be modified by the attacker, and it can only be invoked indirectly. An untrusted interfering code sequence can be authored directly by the attacker, and typically it is external to the vulnerable product.


### Alternative Terms
Race Condition

ChildOf -> CWE-691
CanPrecede -> CWE-416
CanPrecede -> CWE-476

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** The relationship between race conditions and synchronization problems (CWE-662) needs to be further developed. They are not necessarily two perspectives of the same core concept, since synchronization is only one technique for avoiding race conditions, and synchronization can be used for other purposes besides race condition prevention.

**[Research Gap]** Race conditions in web applications are under-studied and probably under-reported. However, in 2008 there has been growing interest in this area.

**[Research Gap]** Much of the focus of race condition research has been in Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) variants (CWE-367), but many race conditions are related to synchronization problems that do not necessarily require a time-of-check.

**[Research Gap]** From a classification/taxonomy perspective, the relationships between concurrency and program state need closer investigation and may be useful in organizing related issues.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-29527:** Go application for cloud management creates a world-writable sudoers file that allows local attackers to inject sudo rules and escalate privileges to root by winning a race condition.
- **CVE-2021-1782:** Chain: improper locking (CWE-667) leads to race condition (CWE-362), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2021-0920:** Chain: mobile platform race condition (CWE-362) leading to use-after-free (CWE-416), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.




## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check. This can cause the product to perform invalid actions when the resource is in an unexpected state.

### Extended Description
This weakness can be security-relevant when an attacker can influence the state of the resource between check and use. This can happen with shared resources such as files, memory, or even variables in multithreaded programs.

### Alternative Terms
TOCTTOU: The TOCTTOU acronym expands to "Time Of Check To Time Of Use".
TOCCTOU: The TOCCTOU acronym is most likely a typo of TOCTTOU, but it has been used in some influential documents, so the typo is repeated fairly frequently.

**Reasons:**

### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** TOCTOU issues do not always involve symlinks, and not every symlink issue is a TOCTOU problem.

**[Research Gap]** Non-symlink TOCTOU issues are not reported frequently, but they are likely to occur in code that attempts to be secure.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2015-1743:** TOCTOU in sandbox process allows installation of untrusted browser add-ons by replacing a file after it has been verified, but before it is executed
- **CVE-2003-0813:** A multi-threaded race condition allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash or reboot) by causing two threads to process the same RPC request, which causes one thread to use memory after it has been freed.
- **CVE-2004-0594:** PHP flaw allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by aborting execution before the initialization of key data structures is complete.




## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.
