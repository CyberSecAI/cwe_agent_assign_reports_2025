It doesn't contain any vulnerability information related to a CVE.\n\n**Content from github.com_e75b0b0e_20250624_193924.html (stripped)**\n\nThis content details a heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability (AddressSanitizer report) in GPAC, specifically in `media_tools/mpegts.c` at line 2163 within the `gf_m2ts_process_pmt` function.\n\n*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Heap-buffer-overflow. The code reads beyond the allocated buffer size.\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Heap buffer overflow.\n*   **Impact of exploitation:**  The ASan report indicates a memory corruption issue, potentially leading to crashes or arbitrary code execution.\n*   **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered when processing MPEG-TS packets, specifically during PMT (Program Map Table) processing. The provided run command `./MP4Box -dash 1000 crsh1` demonstrates a way to trigger the issue.\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker can provide a crafted MPEG-TS stream (e.g., through a file or network stream) that triggers the vulnerability. No specific privileges are required beyond the ability to provide input to MP4Box.\n*   **Mitigation or fix:** The provided information does not include a fix. The issue was reported on Feb 29, 2020, and the commit referenced (8c5e847) in the first content snippet may contain a fix, but this is not explicitly stated. The commit message mentions fixing bugs/leaks in m2tsfuzz.\n\nThe provided GDB info points to the vulnerable line of code: `if (es->stream_type == GF_M2TS_VIDEO_HEVC) nb_hevc++;` within the `gf_m2ts_process_pmt` function.\n\nThis content provides more detail than a typical CVE description, including the specific file, function, and line number where the vulnerability occurs, as well as the ASan report and GDB backtrace.",

CWE-122 is a variant of CWE-119, offering a more specific classification when the buffer overflow occurs on the heap.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe122[\"CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    \n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe122 primary\n    class cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **heap-based buffer overflow** (CWE-122), triggered by processing a crafted MP4 file. This leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states a \"**heap-based buffer overflow**\" in GPAC, which is the primary weakness. The provided content from github.com confirms this and specifies the affected function `gf_m2ts_process_pmt` in `media_tools/mpegts.c`.\n\nThe description and the github content align perfectly with CWE-122, \"Heap-based Buffer Overflow\". This CWE is a Variant-level weakness, which is the preferred level of abstraction. The evidence from the github content indicates a memory corruption issue due to reading beyond the allocated buffer size, potentially leading to crashes.\n\nCWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) was considered but deemed too general. The vulnerability is specifically a heap-based buffer overflow, making CWE-122 a more accurate choice.\n\nCWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) was also considered, but the information suggests the vulnerability is a write (overflow), not simply a read. While an over-read may precede an overflow, the primary weakness described is the overflow itself.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-126: Buffer Over-read\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations after the targeted buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA heap overflow condition is a buffer overflow, where the buffer that can be overwritten is allocated in the heap portion of memory, generally meaning that the buffer was allocated using a routine such as malloc().\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs a calculation that can\n         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic\n         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than\n         the original value.
