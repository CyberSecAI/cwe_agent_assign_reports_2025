  "query": "Vite is a frontend tooling framework for javascript. The contents of arbitrary files can be returned to the browser. By adding ?.svg with ?.wasm?init or with sec-fetch-dest script header, the server.fs.deny restriction was able to bypass. This bypass is only possible if the file is smaller than build.assetsInlineLimit (default 4kB) and when using Vite 6.0+. Only apps explicitly exposing the Vite dev server to the network (using --host or server.host config option) are affected. This vulnerability is fixed in 4.5.12, 5.4.17, 6.0.14, 6.1.4, and 6.2.5.",
