  "description": "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor, Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information vulnerability in Maven Archetype Plugin. This issue affects Maven Archetype Plugin from 3.2.1 before 3.3.0. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 3.3.0, which fixes the issue. Archetype integration testing creates a file called ./target/classes/archetype-it/archetype-settings.xml This file contains all the content from the users ~/.m2/settings.xml file, which often contains information they do not want to publish. We expect that on many developer machines, this also contains credentials. When the user runs mvn verify again (without a mvn clean), this file becomes part of the final artifact. If a developer were to publish this into Maven Central or any other remote repository (whether as a release or a snapshot) their credentials would be published without them knowing.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n\n*   The Maven Archetype Plugin, during integration testing, creates a file `archetype-settings.xml` within the `./target/classes/archetype-it/` directory.\n*   This file inadvertently copies the content of the user's `~/.m2/settings.xml` file.\n*   The `~/.m2/settings.xml` file often contains sensitive information, including credentials.\n*   When `mvn verify` is run again without a `mvn clean`, this file is packaged into the final artifact.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n\n*   **Exposure of Sensitive Information:** The plugin inadvertently includes user's local settings (potentially containing credentials) into the artifact being built.\n*   **Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information**: Local settings are stored in a location that might be unintentionally included in a published artifact.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Credential Exposure:** If a developer publishes the artifact containing the `archetype-settings.xml` to a public or shared repository (like Maven Central), their credentials could be exposed to unauthorized actors.\n*   **Compromise of Accounts:** Exposed credentials could be used to gain unauthorized access to the user's accounts or systems.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Publishing Artifact with Sensitive Data:** A developer who runs `mvn verify` without a `mvn clean` and then publishes the artifact to a remote repository.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   The attacker needs to be able to access the published artifact, which can be in a public repository or a shared repository that they have access to.\n* No other specific capabilities are needed.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n*   The vulnerability exists in versions 3.2.1 and prior.\n*   The fix is in version 3.3.0.\n*   The issue is tracked as ARCHETYPE-657 in Apache Jira.",

However, CWE-922 (Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information) was chosen as a more encompassing and relevant classification. CWE-538 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory) was selected as a secondary CWE, representing the specific way in which the sensitive information was exposed.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe922[\"CWE-922: Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe538[\"CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    cwe256[\"CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\"]\n\n    cwe538 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe256 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    cwe922 -->|PARENT| cwe522\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe922 primary\n    class cwe538 secondary\n    class cwe522,cwe256,cwe200 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **insecure storage of sensitive information** from the user's `~/.m2/settings.xml` file, which is then inserted into an externally accessible file, ultimately leading to the exposure of that sensitive information to unauthorized actors.\n  - **Root Cause:** Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information (CWE-922)\n  - **Mechanism:** Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory (CWE-538)\n  - **Impact:** Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **insecure storage of sensitive information**. The evidence clearly points to the Maven Archetype Plugin copying the contents of the user's `~/.m2/settings.xml` file, which often contains credentials, into a file that could be unintentionally published.\n\nThe selection of CWE-922 (Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information) as the primary CWE is based on the **rootcause** and weakness phrases: \"**insecure storage of sensitive information**\". While other CWEs like CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials) and CWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password) were considered, they were deemed too specific. CWE-922 provides a broader classification that encompasses the general issue of sensitive data being stored **insecurely**, regardless of the specific method.\n\nCWE-538 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory) was selected as a secondary CWE to represent the specific mechanism by which the sensitive information was exposed. This CWE accurately describes how the contents of the `~/.m2/settings.xml` file were copied into the `archetype-settings.xml` file, making it accessible to unauthorized actors if the artifact was published.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the final selection by highlighting the hierarchical connections between CWEs. While CWE-522 and CWE-256 are related to the vulnerability, they are more specific cases of **insecure storage**. CWE-922 sits higher in the hierarchy and provides a more general classification that encompasses the overall issue.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately represent both the **root cause (CWE-922)** and the mechanism of exposure (CWE-538) without being overly specific or focusing solely on the impact of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product makes files or directories accessible to unauthorized actors, even though they should not be.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits or stores authentication credentials, but it uses an insecure method that is susceptible to unauthorized interception and/or retrieval.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-359: Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent a person's private, personal information from being accessed by actors who either (1) are not explicitly authorized to access the information or (2) do not have the implicit consent of the person about whom the information is collected.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nDuring installation, installed file permissions are set to allow anyone to modify those files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
