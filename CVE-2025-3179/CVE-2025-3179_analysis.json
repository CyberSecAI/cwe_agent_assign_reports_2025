  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-3179 Content\n\nThis content **RELATES** to a vulnerability, but it's a report *about* a vulnerability, not the official CVE description itself. It provides more detail than a typical CVE description would.\n\nHere's the extracted information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\n*   A SQL injection vulnerability exists because the `/doctor/deletepatient.php` file directly uses the 'ic' parameter in SQL queries without proper cleaning or validation.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   SQL Injection\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   Unauthorized database access\n*   Sensitive data leakage\n*   Data tampering\n*   System control\n*   Service interruption\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   The 'ic' parameter in a POST request to `/doctor/deletepatient.php` is vulnerable.\n*   No login or authorization is required to exploit the vulnerability.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   An attacker needs to be able to send a crafted POST request to the vulnerable endpoint. No authentication is required.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n1.  **Use prepared statements and parameter binding:** This separates SQL code from user input.\n2.  **Input validation and filtering:**  Ensure user input conforms to the expected format.\n3.  **Minimize database user permissions:** Use accounts with the minimum necessary permissions.\n4.  **Regular security audits:** Conduct regular code and system security audits.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n*   **Affected Product:** Online Doctor Appointment Booking System PHP and Mysql\n*   **Vendor Homepage:** <https://projectworlds.in/free-projects/php-projects/online-doctor-appointment-booking-system-php-and-mysql/>\n*   **Vulnerable File:** `/doctor/deletepatient.php`\n*   **Version:** V1.0\n*   **Software Link:** <https://projectworlds.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/PHP-Doctor-Appointment-System.zip>\n*   **Payload Example:** `ic=1 AND 9341=BENCHMARK(5000000,MD5(0x66767148))`\n*   The report includes output from `sqlmap` demonstrating the vulnerability.",

Although other CWEs were considered, they were either too general (Class level) or didn't directly address the root cause of the **SQL injection**. The focus on direct user input leading to **SQL injection** solidifies CWE-89 as the most accurate classification. There are no parent-child or chain relationships in this case because the evidence points directly to the root cause.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe89 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward:\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')** (CWE-89) due to the direct use of the 'ic' parameter in SQL queries without proper sanitization.\n2.  **Impact:** Unauthorized database access, sensitive data leakage, data tampering, system control, service interruption.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified **SQL injection** as the primary issue, and the retriever results confirmed CWE-89 as the top candidate.

The other CWEs were considered but were deemed less specific or representative of the root cause.
