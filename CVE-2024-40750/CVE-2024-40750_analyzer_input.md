## Analysis of Linksys Velop Router Vulnerability

Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the security vulnerability affecting Linksys Velop Pro 6E and Pro 7 mesh routers:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the transmission of Wi-Fi login details (SSID and password) in plaintext to Amazon AWS servers during router setup and potentially during normal operation. This insecure practice exposes user credentials to interception. The issue may stem from third-party software used in the Linksys firmware.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Plaintext Transmission:** The primary weakness is sending sensitive data (Wi-Fi SSID and password) in clear text over the network. This lack of encryption makes the data vulnerable to interception.
*   **Data Transmission to Third-Party Server:** The routers transmit this sensitive data to a server controlled by a third-party (Amazon AWS), rather than solely using local communications.
*   **Lack of Adequate Security Measures:** The routers lack basic security measures like encryption for sensitive data in transit. The firmware update released by Linksys did not address the issue.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks:** An attacker positioned between the Linksys router and the AWS server can intercept the plaintext Wi-Fi credentials.
*   **Unauthorized Network Access:**  Successful MITM attacks could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the victim's Wi-Fi network.
*   **Data Breach:** The captured Wi-Fi credentials can be used to access other devices on the network and potentially access more sensitive data.
*   **Network Intrusion and Data Loss:** Researchers strongly advise against buying the affected routers because of serious risks of network intrusion and data loss.
*  **Compromise of Small Offices**: The vulnerability is particularly concerning for both personal and professional environments, as Linksys recommends the Velop product line for small offices.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network Sniffing:** An attacker intercepts network traffic between the Linksys router and the AWS server.
*   **MITM Positioning:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic which could be on the local network, or somewhere on the path to the AWS server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to intercept data packets, either on the local network or somewhere along the communication path to the AWS server.
*   **Packet Analysis Tools:** The attacker would need tools to capture and analyze network packets to extract the plaintext Wi-Fi credentials.
* **Technical Skills**:  While the Linksys vulnerability is substantial, breaching a network still requires some technical skill.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by the Belgian consumer organization, Testaankoop, during routine installation checks.
*   Testaankoop contacted Linksys in November to report the vulnerability but the company did not effectively address the problem.
*   The vulnerability is present in the latest firmware of the Linksys Velop Pro 7 router.
*   Linksys has not yet responded to inquiries from the media regarding the vulnerability.
*   The article mentions that changing the Wi-Fi password using the web interface of the router, instead of using the app, avoids sending the SSID name and password in clear text.
* The discussion on Hacker News also highlights how common this behaviour is with other vendors as well including sending passwords to the cloud and also transmitting telemetry.
