This insecure practice exposes user credentials to interception. The issue may stem from third-party software used in the Linksys firmware.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n*   **Plaintext Transmission:** The primary weakness is sending sensitive data (Wi-Fi SSID and password) in clear text over the network. This lack of encryption makes the data vulnerable to interception.\n*   **Data Transmission to Third-Party Server:** The routers transmit this sensitive data to a server controlled by a third-party (Amazon AWS), rather than solely using local communications.\n*   **Lack of Adequate Security Measures:** The routers lack basic security measures like encryption for sensitive data in transit. The firmware update released by Linksys did not address the issue.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks:** An attacker positioned between the Linksys router and the AWS server can intercept the plaintext Wi-Fi credentials.\n*   **Unauthorized Network Access:**  Successful MITM attacks could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the victim's Wi-Fi network.\n*   **Data Breach:** The captured Wi-Fi credentials can be used to access other devices on the network and potentially access more sensitive data.\n*   **Network Intrusion and Data Loss:** Researchers strongly advise against buying the affected routers because of serious risks of network intrusion and data loss.\n*  **Compromise of Small Offices**: The vulnerability is particularly concerning for both personal and professional environments, as Linksys recommends the Velop product line for small offices.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n*   **Network Sniffing:** An attacker intercepts network traffic between the Linksys router and the AWS server.\n*   **MITM Positioning:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic which could be on the local network, or somewhere on the path to the AWS server.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to intercept data packets, either on the local network or somewhere along the communication path to the AWS server.\n*   **Packet Analysis Tools:** The attacker would need tools to capture and analyze network packets to extract the plaintext Wi-Fi credentials.\n* **Technical Skills**:  While the Linksys vulnerability is substantial, breaching a network still requires some technical skill.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n*   The vulnerability was discovered by the Belgian consumer organization, Testaankoop, during routine installation checks.\n*   Testaankoop contacted Linksys in November to report the vulnerability but the company did not effectively address the problem.\n*   The vulnerability is present in the latest firmware of the Linksys Velop Pro 7 router.\n*   Linksys has not yet responded to inquiries from the media regarding the vulnerability.\n*   The article mentions that changing the Wi-Fi password using the web interface of the router, instead of using the app, avoids sending the SSID name and password in clear text.\n* The discussion on Hacker News also highlights how common this behaviour is with other vendors as well including sending passwords to the cloud and also transmitting telemetry.\n```",

CWE-319 is a more specific case of CWE-522, making it a better fit as the primary CWE. CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information) was considered as an alternative or additional CWE, but the focus of the vulnerability is on the transmission rather than the storage of the password.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n\n    cwe319 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe319 primary\n    class cwe522,cwe312 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **insecure transmission of Wi-Fi passwords in cleartext** (CWE-319). This leads to the exposure of sensitive information, which could then be used by attackers to gain unauthorized access to Wi-Fi networks. The chain is as follows:\n1.  **Cleartext Transmission (CWE-319):** The router sends Wi-Fi credentials without encryption.\n2.  **Compromised Credentials (CWE-522):** Due to the cleartext transmission, credentials become vulnerable.\n3.  **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers intercept the credentials and gain network access (impact).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe analysis strongly supports the classification of this vulnerability as CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information). The vulnerability description explicitly states that the Linksys Velop Pro 6E devices send cleartext Wi-Fi passwords over the public Internet. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this by stating that the root cause of the vulnerability is the transmission of Wi-Fi login details in plaintext to Amazon AWS servers.\n\nWhile CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials) is also relevant, it is a broader category. Since the vulnerability is specifically about cleartext transmission, CWE-319 is the more accurate and specific choice. CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information) was considered but is less relevant as the primary issue is with transmission, not storage.\n\nThe decision is based on direct evidence from the vulnerability description and the CVE reference summary. The relationship analysis highlights that CWE-319 is a child of CWE-522, making it the more precise classification.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-290: Authentication Bypass by Spoofing\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThis attack-focused weakness is caused by incorrectly implemented authentication schemes that are subject to spoofing attacks.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1188: Initialization of a Resource with an Insecure Default\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product initializes or sets a resource with a default that is intended to be changed by the administrator, but the default is not secure.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
