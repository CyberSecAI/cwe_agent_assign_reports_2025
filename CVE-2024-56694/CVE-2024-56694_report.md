# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-56694

## Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved bpf fix **recursive lock** when verdict program return SK_PASS When the stream_verdict program returns SK_PASS, it places the received skb into its own receive queue, but a **recursive lock** eventually occurs, leading to an operating system deadlock. This issue has been present since v6.9. sk_psock_strp_data_ready write_lock_bh(&sk->sk_callback_lock) strp_data_ready strp_read_sock read_sock -> tcp_read_sock strp_recv cb.rcv_msg -> sk_psock_strp_read # now stream_verdict return SK_PASS without peer sock assign __SK_PASS = sk_psock_map_verd(SK_PASS, NULL) sk_psock_verdict_apply sk_psock_skb_ingress_self sk_psock_skb_ingress_enqueue sk_psock_data_ready read_lock_bh(&sk->sk_callback_lock) <= dead lock This topic has been discussed before, but it has not been fixed.

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-833 | Deadlock | 0.9 | Base |  Primary CWE | Allowed |
| CWE-667 | Improper Locking | 0.7 | Class | Secondary Candidate | Allowed-with-Review |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is identified as **CWE-833: Deadlock**. This is directly supported by the vulnerability description stating that a recursive lock leads to an operating system deadlock. **CWE-667: Improper Locking** is a related Class-level CWE, and **CWE-833** is a Base-level CWE which provides more specificity.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with an **improper locking** scenario due to a **recursive lock** when the verdict program returns SK_PASS, leading to an operating system **deadlock**.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is primarily based on the provided vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which clearly indicates the **recursive lock** condition leading to a **deadlock**. The evidence strongly supports mapping the vulnerability to **CWE-833: Deadlock**.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-667: Improper Locking
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-833: Deadlock
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product contains multiple threads or executable segments that are waiting for each other to release a necessary lock, resulting in deadlock.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-909: Missing Initialization of Resource
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not initialize a critical resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
