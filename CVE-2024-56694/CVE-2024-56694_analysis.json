  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe vulnerability stems from a recursive lock situation within the BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) subsystem of the Linux kernel. Specifically, when a stream_verdict BPF program returns `SK_PASS`, the received skb (socket buffer) is placed back into its own receive queue. This triggers a recursive locking scenario.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n-   **Recursive Lock:** The core issue is the use of `write_lock_bh` followed by a subsequent `read_lock_bh` on the same lock (`sk->sk_callback_lock`) within the data ready handling path. This occurs when a verdict program returns SK_PASS, causing the same socket's data_ready handler to be called again.\n-   **Incorrect Lock Usage:** The `sk_psock_strp_data_ready` function initially uses `write_lock_bh` which was unnecessary.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n-   **Operating System Deadlock:** The recursive lock leads to a deadlock, causing the operating system to become unresponsive.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n-   **BPF Program:** An attacker would need to load a malicious BPF program that uses the stream_verdict functionality and returns `SK_PASS`.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n-   **Privileged Access:** The attacker would need the capability to load BPF programs, typically requiring root or elevated privileges.\n-   **Knowledge of BPF:** The attacker needs an understanding of BPF programming, particularly the stream_verdict program type.\n\n**Technical Details:**\n\nThe provided code snippets show the problematic lock usage:\n\n```\nsk_psock_strp_data_ready\nwrite_lock_bh(&sk->sk_callback_lock)\nstrp_data_ready\nstrp_read_sock\nread_sock -> tcp_read_sock\nstrp_recv\ncb.rcv_msg -> sk_psock_strp_read\n# now stream_verdict return SK_PASS without peer sock assign\n__SK_PASS = sk_psock_map_verd(SK_PASS, NULL)\nsk_psock_verdict_apply\nsk_psock_skb_ingress_self\nsk_psock_skb_ingress_enqueue\nsk_psock_data_ready\nread_lock_bh(&sk->sk_callback_lock) <= dead lock\n```\n\nThe fix involves changing `write_lock_bh` to `read_lock_bh` in `sk_psock_strp_data_ready` function which is the correct lock to be held for the operation being performed at that point in code:\n\n```diff\n--- a/net/core/skmsg.c\n+++ b/net/core/skmsg.c\n@@ -1117,9 +1117,9 @@\n \tif (tls_sw_has_ctx_rx(sk)) {\n \t\tpsock->saved_data_ready(sk);\n \t} else {\n-\t\twrite_lock_bh(&sk->sk_callback_lock);\n+\t\tread_lock_bh(&sk->sk_callback_lock);\n \t\tstrp_data_ready(&psock->strp);\n-\t\twrite_unlock_bh(&sk->sk_callback_lock);\n+\t\tread_unlock_bh(&sk->sk_callback_lock);\n \t}\n }\n rcu_read_unlock();\n```\n**Additional Notes:**\n*   The vulnerability has been present since v6.9 of the Linux kernel.\n*   The fix addresses the recursive lock issue by changing `write_lock_bh` to `read_lock_bh` which eliminates the deadlock.\n*   The commits provide the relevant code changes and details of the vulnerability.\n\nThis information provides a more detailed analysis than a basic CVE description would provide.",
