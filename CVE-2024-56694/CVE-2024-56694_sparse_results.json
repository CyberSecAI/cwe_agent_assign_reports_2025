  "query": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved bpf fix recursive lock when verdict program return SK_PASS When the stream_verdict program returns SK_PASS, it places the received skb into its own receive queue, but a recursive lock eventually occurs, leading to an operating system deadlock.
