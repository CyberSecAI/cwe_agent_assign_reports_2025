# Vulnerability Description

    The FULL - Cliente plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the license plan parameter in all versions up to, and including, 3.1.12 due to **insufficient input sanitization and output escaping** as well as **missing authorization** and capability checks on the related functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts that will execute whenever an administrative user accesses wp-admin dashboard
