Affected is an unknown function of the file /admin/sys/menu/list. The manipulation of the argument sort/order leads to sql injection. It is possible to launch the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. Continious delivery with rolling releases is used by this product. Therefore, no version details of affected nor updated releases are available.",
