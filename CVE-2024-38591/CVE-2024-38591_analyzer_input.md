# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-38591

## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved RDMA/hns Fix **deadlock** on SRQ async events. xa_lock for SRQ table may be required in AEQ. Use xa_store_irq()/ xa_erase_irq() to avoid **deadlock**.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **deadlock**
- **vector:** async events
- **product:** Linux kernel
- **component:** RDMA/hns

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The root cause of the vulnerability is a potential deadlock in the RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access) subsystem, specifically within the hns (Hisilicon Network Subsystem) driver when handling Shared Receive Queue (SRQ) asynchronous events.
- The issue arises because the `xa_lock` for the SRQ table can be required within the Asynchronous Event Queue (AEQ) context. This can lead to a deadlock if the lock is already held elsewhere.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Deadlock:** The primary vulnerability is a deadlock condition. The code was using `xa_store` and `xa_erase` without proper interrupt handling, leading to potential deadlocks when accessing the SRQ table from the interrupt context (AEQ).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **System Hang/Unresponsiveness:** A successful exploitation of this vulnerability can result in a system hang or unresponsiveness, as the deadlock prevents the affected processes from continuing their execution. This will impact the availability of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Triggering SRQ Asynchronous Events:** The attack vector involves triggering SRQ asynchronous events while the SRQ table lock is held in a different context which will lead to a deadlock.
-   **Internal Kernel Activity:** The vulnerability is triggered by internal kernel operations when the device is actively being used. It's not a remotely exploitable vulnerability, but an issue arising from the driver's internal concurrency handling.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Kernel level access:** The attacker needs to trigger specific operations that create SRQs and generate async events within the kernel, requiring at least local system access to exploit.
-   **No Remote Exploitation:** This vulnerability is not remotely exploitable. The attacker needs to have some level of control or be able to trigger specific internal operations of the affected system.

**Additional Notes:**

- The fix replaces `xa_store` with `xa_store_irq` and `xa_erase` with `xa_erase_irq` to ensure that the operations are performed with the correct interrupt handling context, preventing the deadlock situation by using interrupt-safe versions of these functions.

- The provided commit messages and code diffs explicitly highlight that the fix is for a deadlock that could occur during SRQ asynchronous event handling.

- The commit message also notes the specific commit it fixes `Fixes: 81fce6291d99 ("RDMA/hns: Add SRQ asynchronous event support")`, further confirming the root cause and area of impact.
