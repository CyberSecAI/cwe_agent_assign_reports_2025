# Analysis for CVE-2024-54747

# Summary

| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-259 | Use of Hard-coded Password | 1.0 | Variant | Primary CWE | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship is that CWE-259 is a Variant of CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials). This means CWE-259 is a more specific case of CWE-798. Since the vulnerability description specifically mentions a **hardcoded password**, choosing the more specific CWE-259 is appropriate.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain is straightforward:

1.  **Root Cause:** **Hardcoded password** (CWE-259)
2.  **Impact:** Attackers can log in as root, gaining unauthorized access.

There are no apparent missing links in this chain based on the provided information.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is based on the vulnerability description, which explicitly states that the vulnerability involves a **hardcoded password**. The high confidence is due to the direct match between the vulnerability description and the definition of CWE-259 (Use of Hard-coded Password).

The graph relationships influenced the selection by confirming that choosing the more specific Variant (CWE-259) over the more general Base (CWE-798) is the correct approach, given the information available.

The selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because the description clearly identifies a **password** as the hardcoded credential, making CWE-259 a precise fit.

- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The use of a hard-coded cryptographic key significantly increases the possibility that encrypted data may be recovered.
