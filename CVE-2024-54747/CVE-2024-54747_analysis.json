This means CWE-259 is a more specific case of CWE-798. Since the vulnerability description specifically mentions a **hardcoded password**, choosing the more specific CWE-259 is appropriate.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe259[\"CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password\"]\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n\n    cwe259 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe259 primary\n    class cwe798 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward:\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Hardcoded password** (CWE-259)\n2.  **Impact:** Attackers can log in as root, gaining unauthorized access.\n\nThere are no apparent missing links in this chain based on the provided information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the vulnerability description, which explicitly states that the vulnerability involves a **hardcoded password**. The high confidence is due to the direct match between the vulnerability description and the definition of CWE-259 (Use of Hard-coded Password).\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the selection by confirming that choosing the more specific Variant (CWE-259) over the more general Base (CWE-798) is the correct approach, given the information available.\n\nThe selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because the description clearly identifies a **password** as the hardcoded credential, making CWE-259 a precise fit.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe
