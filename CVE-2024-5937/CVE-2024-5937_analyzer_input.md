# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-5937

## Vulnerability Description
The Simple Alert Boxes plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugins Alert shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.0 due to **insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the `[alert]` shortcode of the Simple Alert Boxes plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize or escape user-provided input when rendering the `[alert]` shortcode. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary web scripts within the context of a user's browser when they view a page containing the malicious shortcode.
*   **Account Takeover:** The injected script could potentially steal user cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform other actions, possibly leading to account compromise.
*   **Malware Distribution:** The injected script can be used to distribute malware, further compromising the security of visitors and the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Shortcode Injection:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript within the `text` attribute of the `[alert]` shortcode
    e.g. `[alert text="<script>alert('XSS')</script>"]`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least contributor-level access to WordPress to create or modify content with shortcodes.
*   **Content Creation/Modification:** The attacker must be able to add or edit posts or pages to insert the malicious shortcode.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability exists in all versions of the Simple Alert Boxes plugin up to and including version 1.4.0.
*   The Wordfence report mentions that there is no known patch available.
*   The provided code from `plugin.php` shows the shortcode handler function `simple_alert_boxes_output` and its usage of the `text` attribute without proper sanitization.
* The vulnerability is classified as a medium severity issue with a CVSS score of 6.4.

**Summary**
The Simple Alert Boxes plugin is vulnerable to stored XSS due to a lack of input sanitization in its shortcode implementation. This allows authenticated attackers with contributor access and above to inject malicious JavaScript code that will execute in the browsers of users visiting the compromised pages.
