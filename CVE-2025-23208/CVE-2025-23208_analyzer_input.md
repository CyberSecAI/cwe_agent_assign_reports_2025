# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-23208

## Vulnerability Description
zot is a production-ready vendor-neutral OCI image registry. The group data stored for users in the boltdb database (meta.db) is an append-list so **group revocations/removals are ignored in the API**. **SetUserGroups is alled on login, but instead of replacing the group memberships, they are appended**. This may be due to some conflict with the group definitions in the config file, but that wasnt obvious to me if it were the case. Any Zot configuration that relies on group-based authorization will not respect group remove/revocation by an IdP. This issue has been addressed in version 2.1.2. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

- **product:** Zot

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-23208 based on provided content:

**1. Verification:**

The content directly relates to CVE-2025-23208 as it explicitly states the CVE ID and provides a detailed description of the vulnerability.

**2. Extracted Information:**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The group data stored for users in the boltdb database is an append-list, meaning group revocations/removals are ignored.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Incorrect implementation of group membership updates in the boltdb database. Instead of replacing group memberships, they are appended.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Zot configurations relying on group-based authorization will not respect group remove/revocation by an IdP, potentially granting unauthorized access.
*   **Attack vectors:** An attacker can exploit this by removing a user from a group in the IdP, but still gaining access to resources due to the outdated group information stored in Zot.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs the ability to manage group memberships in the Identity Provider (IdP) connected to Zot. No specific privileges within Zot itself are required to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Mitigation or fix:** The vulnerability was patched in version 2.1.2. The fix involves replacing the append operation with a proper replacement of group memberships in the `SetUserGroups` function (in both `boltdb.go` and `dynamodb.go`).
*   **CVSS Score:** 7.3 (High)
*   **Affected versions:** <=2.1.1
*   **Patched versions:** 2.1.2

**3. Additional Details:**

The content provides more detail than the placeholder CVE description. It includes:

*   Specific file and line numbers where the vulnerability exists (`pkg/meta/boltdb/boltdb.go#L1665` and `pkg/meta/dynamodb/dynamodb.go#L1650`).
*   A Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrating the vulnerability.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control

**Authentication**:
Determines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.

* Example phrases: "user must log in", "lack of login check", "bypasses login"
* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.

  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* – used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).

**Authorization**:
Determines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do. It decides access *after* identity is verified.

* Example phrases: "unauthorized access", "regular user can access admin panel", "role checks are missing"
* CWE relevance: use CWEs like 862, 863, 285 for authorization errors:

  * **CWE-862**: *Missing Authorization* – the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all.
  * **CWE-863**: *Incorrect Authorization* – the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).
  * **CWE-285**: *Improper Authorization* – general category for any flawed authorization logic or design.

**Access Control**:
A broader term that includes both authentication and authorization. Governs how resources are protected and who can access them under what conditions.

* CWE relevance:

  * **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* – top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear.
  * This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.

## Mapping Discussion – Common Misclassification Patterns

### 1. **CWE-306 vs CWE-862**:

* **306** is about lack of **authentication** (e.g., *no login required at all*).
* **862** is about lack of **authorization** *after* authentication (e.g., *admin check missing*).
* ✅ Example CWE-306: *“An unauthenticated attacker can invoke the password reset API.”*
* ✅ Example CWE-862: *“An authenticated user without admin privileges can delete any user account.”*

### 2. **CWE-285 vs CWE-284**:

* **285** is specific to authorization flaws – it's a better choice than 284 **if** the issue involves *improper or missing role checks*.
* **284** should be reserved for general access control issues when it’s unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.

---

## Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification

**Phrase like "unauthorized access" is not enough.**

* If you **cannot determine whether identity was checked**, assume it’s **authorization** and consider 862 or 863.
* If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** → CWE-306.
* If the **access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced**, but it's not due to missing checks, consider **CWE-284**.

---

## Good Mapping Examples

* ✅ **CWE-306**: “The endpoint `/admin/deleteUser` does not require any authentication.”
* ✅ **CWE-862**: “Any logged-in user can change any other user's email without being an admin.”
* ✅ **CWE-863**: “An admin check exists but incorrectly grants access to non-admin users.”
* ✅ **CWE-285**: “Application uses a static role check that fails when roles change dynamically.”
* ✅ **CWE-284**: “Inconsistent enforcement of access rules across services with unclear policy source.”
