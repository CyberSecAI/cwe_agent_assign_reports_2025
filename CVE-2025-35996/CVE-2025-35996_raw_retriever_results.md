# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2025-35996
## Query
KUNBUS PiCtory version 2.11.1 and earlier are vulnerable when an authenticated remote attacker crafts a special filename that can be stored by API endpoints. That filename is later transmitted to the client in order to show a list of configuration files. Due to a missing escape or sanitization, the filename could be executed as HTML script tag resulting in a cross-site-scripting attack.

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: 'missing escape', 'sanitization'
- **weakness**: 'cross-site scripting', 'weakness'
