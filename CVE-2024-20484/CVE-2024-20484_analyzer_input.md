# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-20484

## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability in the External Agent Assignment Service (EAAS) feature of Cisco Enterprise Chat and Email (ECE) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of Media Routing Peripheral Interface Manager (MR PIM) traffic that is received by an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted MR PIM traffic to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to trigger a failure on the MR PIM connection between Cisco ECE and Cisco Unified Contact Center Enterprise (CCE), leading to a DoS condition on EAAS that would prevent customers from starting chat, callback, or delayed callback sessions. Note When the attack traffic stops, the EAAS process must be manually restarted to restore normal operation. To restart the process in the System Console, choose Shared Resources &gt Services &gt Unified CCE &gt EAAS, then click Start.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

The advisory includes the CVE identifier, a summary, affected products, fixed software information, and other relevant details.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of this vulnerability lies in the insufficient validation of Media Routing Peripheral Interface Manager (MR PIM) traffic received by Cisco Enterprise Chat and Email (ECE) when the External Agent Assignment Service (EAAS) feature is enabled. Specifically, the vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of MR PIM traffic received by the affected device.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insufficient validation of input data (MR PIM traffic).
- Failure to properly handle crafted network traffic.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful exploit can lead to a denial-of-service condition on the EAAS, preventing customers from initiating chat, callback, or delayed callback sessions.
- **MR PIM Connection Failure:** The exploit can trigger a failure of the MR PIM connection between Cisco ECE and Cisco Unified Contact Center Enterprise (CCE).
- **Manual Restart Required:** The EAAS process must be manually restarted to restore normal operation after the attack traffic stops.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote, Unauthenticated Attacker:** The attacker can be remote and does not require any form of authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Crafted MR PIM Traffic:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability by sending crafted MR PIM traffic to the affected device.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to send network traffic to the affected Cisco ECE server.
- Ability to craft MR PIM traffic.
- No prior authentication to the system is needed.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 7.5, classified as HIGH severity.
