  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-26304 Content\n\nThe provided content details a memory leak vulnerability in the `parseSWF_EXPORTASSETS` function of libming version 0.4.8.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe `parseSWF_EXPORTASSETS` function allocates memory for arrays (`Tags`, `Names`) and strings (`parserrec->Names[i]`) using `malloc` and `readString` but does not free this allocated memory before the function returns, leading to a memory leak.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Memory Leak: Failure to deallocate dynamically allocated memory.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   Memory exhaustion: Repeated calls to `parseSWF_EXPORTASSETS` could eventually exhaust available memory, potentially leading to denial of service or application crashes.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Processing a specially crafted SWF file: An attacker could create a SWF file that, when parsed by a vulnerable version of libming, triggers repeated calls to `parseSWF_EXPORTASSETS`, causing the memory leak.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   Ability to provide a SWF file as input to an application using libming. No special privileges are required.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   Implement memory deallocation: Add `free()` calls to release the memory allocated for `Tags`, `Names`, and the individual strings within `Names` before the function returns.\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   The content provides specific code snippets from `util/parser.c` highlighting the lines responsible for memory allocation.\n*   It includes the output of AddressSanitizer (ASan) which confirms the memory leak and provides details about the allocated memory blocks.\n*   A Proof-of-Concept (PoC) exploit is available as a zip file (`Poc-parseSWF_EXPORTASSETS.zip`).\n*   The commit hash `04aee52363688426eab74f5d6180c149654a6473` is provided, which could be used to locate the vulnerable code in the repository.",
