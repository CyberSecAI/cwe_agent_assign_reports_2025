The specific impact will vary depending on the actions that can be triggered through the vulnerable plugin.\\n\\n**Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted request that is sent by an attacker, typically via a link or embedded content, to the target user. The user's browser will then unintentionally send the request to the vulnerable WordPress site, authenticated with the user's session.\\n\\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\\n*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious request that targets a specific action within the vulnerable plugin.\\n*   The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user with sufficient privileges to click the link or trigger the malicious request.\\n*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the WordPress site to perform the attack.\\n\\n**Additional Notes:**\\n\\n*   The vulnerability is classified as having a low priority and low severity, with a CVSS score of 7.1.\\n*   There is no official fix available for this vulnerability from the plugin developer.\\n*   The vulnerability falls under the OWASP Top 10 category A1: Broken Access Control.\\n*   The vulnerability was reported by a researcher named SOPROBRO.\", similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {}, 'top_cwes_by_threshold': {}}}, similarity_summary=SimilarityInsight(consensus_cwe='', top_cwes=[], confidence_levels={}, total_samples=0), analysis='', analysis_with_relationships='', criticism='', resolution='', relevant_cwes=[{'metadata': {'doc_id': '352', 'name': 'Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'rootcause:lack of CSRF protection', 'keyphrase': 'lack of CSRF protection', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'weakness:XSS', 'keyphrase': 'XSS', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'weakness:cross-site scripting', 'keyphrase': 'cross-site scripting', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'product:Ecommerce Templates ECT Product Carousel', 'keyphrase': 'Ecommerce Templates ECT Product Carousel', 'type': 'product'}, {'id': 'version:n/a through 1.9', 'keyphrase': 'n/a through 1.9', 'type': 'version'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(275.8072972738115)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '434', 'name': 'Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'rootcause:lack of CSRF protection', 'keyphrase': 'lack of CSRF protection', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'weakness:XSS', 'keyphrase': 'XSS', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'product:Ecommerce Templates ECT Product Carousel', 'keyphrase': 'Ecommerce Templates ECT Product Carousel', 'type': 'product'}, {'id': 'version:n/a through 1.9', 'keyphrase': 'n/a through 1.9', 'type': 'version'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(220.90912709603174)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '116', 'name': 'Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
