## Vulnerability Description
This openedx-translations repository contains translation files from Open edX repositories to be kept in sync with Transifex. Before moving to pulling translations from the openedx-translations repository via openedx-atlas, translations in the edx-platform repository were validated using edx-i18n-tools. This validation included protection against malformed translations and translations-based script injections. Prior to this patch, the validation implemented in the openedx-translations repository did not include the same protections. The maintainer inspected the translations in the edx-platform directory of both the main and open-release/redwood.master branches of the openedx-translations repository and found no evidence of exploited translation strings.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **improper validation of translations**
- **vector:** script injection
- **product:** openedx-translations

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-43782:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation for translations within the `openedx-translations` repository before being integrated into the `edx-platform`. Previously, `edx-platform` used `edx-i18n-tools` to validate translations which provided protection against malformed translations and script injection. However, when the project shifted to using `openedx-translations` via `openedx-atlas`, this validation was initially missing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Missing Translation Validation:** The primary weakness is the absence of robust validation on translations in `openedx-translations` before their use in `edx-platform`. This includes checks against malformed translations, invalid brace formats and potentially malicious script injections.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Confidentiality:** A successful exploit could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data through the injection of malicious code or by manipulating the displayed text to trick users into providing personal information.
- **Integrity:** Malicious translations could be used to alter the behavior or appearance of the application, leading to incorrect or harmful actions.
- **Availability:** While not directly impacting availability, manipulated translations could make the application difficult or confusing to use, impacting usability. The CVSS score indicates that availability is not impacted.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network:** The attack vector is network-based as the malicious translations would need to be introduced into the system over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Low Privileges:** An attacker with low privileges could potentially introduce malicious translations.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker requires some user interaction as the malicious translations would need to be loaded and displayed in order to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Attack Complexity High:** It's considered a high complexity attack.

**Additional Information:**

- **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 7.7, considered high. The CVSS metrics are broken down, showing a network attack vector with high confidentiality and integrity impact and a changed scope.
- **Patches:** The issue has been addressed by integrating `edx-i18n-tools` into the `openedx-translations` repository, specifically through the commits `b244434` and `3c40937`.

In summary, this CVE highlights a vulnerability due to inadequate translation validation that could allow for script injections and other forms of attacks. The fix involved reintroducing the validation mechanism from the `edx-i18n-tools`.
