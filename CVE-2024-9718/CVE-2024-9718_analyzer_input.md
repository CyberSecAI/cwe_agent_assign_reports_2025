# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-9718

## Vulnerability Description
Trimble SketchUp Viewer SKP File Parsing **Out-Of-Bounds Read** Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Trimble SketchUp Viewer. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of SKP files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-24102.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of SKP files. This leads to a read past the end of an allocated buffer.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Out-of-bounds read vulnerability.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attacker can deliver a malicious SKP file to a victim, who would then need to open it using the vulnerable software.
    *   The attacker can also lure the victim to visit a malicious website containing a malicious SKP file, triggering the exploit.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to craft a malicious SKP file with specific data that triggers the out-of-bounds read.
    *   The attacker needs to convince the victim to either open the malicious SKP file or visit a malicious web page that will trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Affected Software:** Trimble SketchUp Viewer.
*   **Fixed Version**: 2024.0.2
