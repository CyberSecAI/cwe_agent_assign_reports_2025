  "description": "A vulnerability in the **access control list (ACL) processing** in the egress direction of Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass a configured ACL. This vulnerability exists because certain packets are handled incorrectly when they are received on an ingress interface on one line card and destined out of an egress interface on another line card where the egress ACL is configured. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to send traffic through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass an egress ACL on the affected device. For more information about this vulnerability, see the section of this advisory. Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.",

While CWE-284 is a broader category, the vulnerability description provides enough evidence to suggest an authorization issue, making CWE-863 a more specific and appropriate choice. The guidance suggests using the more specific child CWE when available.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **incorrect ACL processing**, leading to a bypass of the configured egress ACL. The root cause is the improper handling of packets between different line cards. This allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to send traffic through the device, effectively bypassing the intended access control.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"**access control list (ACL) processing**\" and that the vulnerability results in the ability to \"bypass a configured egress ACL.\" The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reiterates that \"The vulnerability exists because certain packets are handled incorrectly when they are received on an ingress interface on one line card and destined out of an egress interface on another line card where the egress ACL is configured\" and \"A vulnerability in the **access control list (ACL) processing**...could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass a configured ACL.\"\n\nGiven this context, CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) was selected as the primary CWE because it directly addresses the **incorrect** implementation of authorization, specifically related to the ACL. CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) was considered as a broader classification, but the details available lean towards authorization. The \"Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance\" section also helped in differentiating between the different access control flaws.\n\nThe retriever results listed several potential CWEs, including CWE-863 and CWE-284, with varying similarity scores. The final decision was based on the evidence in the vulnerability description and the relationship between the CWEs, opting for the more specific CWE-863. The abstraction level of CWE-863 (Class) is higher than Base but is a better fit than the Pillar level CWE-284.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.

It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-696: Incorrect Behavior Order\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs multiple related behaviors, but the behaviors are performed in the wrong order in ways which may produce resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 1910.91\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-285: Improper Authorization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 1909.75\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-285 is high",
