Affected by this vulnerability is the function findUser of the file wetech-cms-master\\wetech-core\\src\\main\\java\\tech\\wetech\\cms\\dao\\UserDao.java. The manipulation of the argument searchValue/gId/rId leads to **sql injection**. The attack can be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the SQL injection vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe vulnerability stems from the insecure construction of SQL queries in the `UserDao.java` file. The application uses string concatenation to build the HQL query, directly embedding user-supplied parameters `searchValue`, `gId`, and `rId` without proper sanitization or parameterization.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n* **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the direct use of string concatenation with user-controlled input.\n* **Lack of Input Validation/Sanitization:** The application fails to properly validate or sanitize the `searchValue`, `gId`, and `rId` parameters before incorporating them into the SQL query.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n* **Data Breach/Manipulation:** An attacker could exploit the vulnerability to bypass authentication, access sensitive data, modify the database, or potentially execute arbitrary commands on the database server.\n* **Privilege Escalation:** Depending on the database user's privileges, an attacker may gain elevated privileges within the application.\n* **Database Integrity Compromise:** The attacker can potentially modify, delete, or corrupt data within the database.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n* **HTTP GET Parameters:** The attacker manipulates the `searchValue`, `gId`, and `rId` parameters in the HTTP GET request to the `/admin/user/list.do` endpoint.\n* **User Search Functionality:** The vulnerable code is located in the user management search feature of the admin console.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n* **Access to Admin Console:** The attacker needs access to the administrative interface to exploit this vulnerability.\n* **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.\n* **Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs to have knowledge of SQL to craft malicious payloads.\n* **Ability to Intercept/Modify HTTP Requests:** While not explicitly required, the attacker may need to intercept and modify HTTP requests to construct the exploit effectively.\n\n**Additional Details from the Content:**\n* The content provides a specific vulnerable code snippet from `UserDao.java`.\n* It highlights the use of `like` clauses with user-supplied input in the SQL query.\n* It shows how the `searchValue` parameter is used to inject SQL by using a single quote and a crafted case statement.\n* It mentions the same injection method applies to `gId` and `rId` parameters.\n* It identifies the vulnerable user management search feature within the admin console.\n* It shows the HTTP GET request which carries the vulnerable parameters.\n* The specific injection payloads are provided for `searchValue` and for `gId`/`rId`",

The vulnerability stems from **improper neutralization of special elements** in SQL commands, leading to **SQL injection**. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship is that CWE-89 is a base-level CWE, which is appropriate given the specific nature of the **SQL injection** vulnerability. The retriever results strongly suggest CWE-89 as the best match.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe89 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward:\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Improper neutralization** of special elements in SQL commands (CWE-89).\n2.  **Impact:** **SQL injection** leading to potential data breach, manipulation, or privilege escalation.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis strongly points to CWE-89 as the most appropriate classification. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions **SQL injection** due to the **manipulation** of the `searchValue/gId/rId` arguments. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the root cause is the **insecure construction of SQL queries** due to the direct embedding of user-supplied parameters without proper sanitization.\n\nThe retriever results also support this classification, with CWE-89 having the highest score. The mapping guidance for CWE-89 allows its usage at the base level of abstraction, making it a suitable choice.\n\nThe evidence is strong and directly supports the classification of CWE-89.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.
