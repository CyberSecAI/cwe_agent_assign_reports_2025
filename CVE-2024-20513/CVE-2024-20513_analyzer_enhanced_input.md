## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability in the Cisco AnyConnect VPN server of Cisco Meraki MX and Cisco Meraki Z Series Teleworker Gateway devices could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a DoS condition for targeted users of the AnyConnect service on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to **insufficient entropy** for handlers that are used during SSL VPN session establishment. An unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by brute forcing valid session handlers. An authenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to the AnyConnect VPN service of an affected device to retrieve a valid session handler and, based on that handler, predict further valid session handlers. The attacker would then send a crafted HTTPS request using the brute-forced or predicted session handler to the AnyConnect VPN server of the device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to terminate targeted SSL VPN sessions, forcing remote users to initiate new VPN connections and reauthenticate.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **insufficient entropy**
- **impact:** DoS condition
- **vector:** crafted HTTPS request
- **attacker:** unauthenticated remote attacker
- **product:** Cisco Meraki MX and Cisco Meraki Z Series Teleworker Gateway
- **component:** Cisco AnyConnect VPN server

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient entropy for handlers used during SSL VPN session establishment.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Predictable session handlers, which can be brute-forced.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Denial of Service (DoS) for targeted users, termination of targeted SSL VPN sessions, forcing users to reauthenticate.
- **Attack vectors:**
  - Unauthenticated attacker: Brute-forcing valid session handlers.
  - Authenticated attacker: Connecting to the AnyConnect VPN to retrieve a valid session handler and predict further valid session handlers.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Remote attacker with network access to the affected device's VPN service. Authenticated attackers need valid VPN credentials to establish an initial session.
