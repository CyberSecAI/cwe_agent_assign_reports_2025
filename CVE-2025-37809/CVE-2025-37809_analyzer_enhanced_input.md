## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved usb typec class Fix **NULL pointer access** Concurrent calls to typec_partner_unlink_device can lead to a **NULL pointer dereference**. This patch adds a mutex to protect USB device pointers and prevent this issue. The same mutex protects both the device pointers and the partner device registration.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **NULL pointer dereference**
- **weakness:** **NULL pointer access**
- **product:** Linux kernel
- **component:** usb typec class
