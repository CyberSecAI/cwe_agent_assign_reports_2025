While it is not the most specific, it accurately captures the core issue of incorrect authorization. A more specific child of CWE-863 could be considered if the exact mechanism of the authorization flaw was known.

The use of specific strings within the loader macros (CWE-1336) enables this bypass.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial analysis pointed towards an authorization issue, which aligns with the description of the vulnerability. The **root cause** is the **incorrect authorization** within the loader macros. The provided evidence supports this assessment, as the vulnerability allows authenticated users to bypass permissions and access sensitive information.\n\nThe decision to classify the vulnerability as CWE-863 is based on the fact that the authorization check is present but flawed, allowing users to bypass intended access restrictions. CWE-1336 is added as a secondary candidate because the use of specific strings in loader macros plays a role in the bypass.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
