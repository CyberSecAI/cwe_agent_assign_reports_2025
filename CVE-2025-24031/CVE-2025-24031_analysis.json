  "description": "PAM-PKCS#11 is a Linux-PAM login module that allows a X.509 certificate based user login. In versions 0.6.12 and prior, the pam_pkcs11 module segfaults when a user presses ctrl-c/ctrl-d when they are asked for a PIN. When a user enters no PIN at all, `pam_get_pwd` will never initialize the password buffer pointer and as such `cleanse` will try to dereference an uninitialized pointer. On my system this pointer happens to have the value 3 most of the time when running sudo and as such it will segfault. The most likely impact to a system affected by this issue is an availability impact due to a daemon that uses PAM crashing. As of time of publication, a patch for the issue is unavailable.",

  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-24031 based on provided content:\n\nThis content **relates to** CVE-2025-24031 and provides more detail than the placeholder description.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability is triggered when pressing `ctrl-c` or `ctrl-d` while prompted for a PIN. This causes the `pam_pkcs11` module to attempt to `cleanse` an uninitialized `password` buffer, leading to a segmentation fault.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Use of an uninitialized variable (`password` buffer) before being passed to a function (`cleanse`) that dereferences it.\n*   Lack of proper error handling when a PIN is not entered.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   Segmentation fault, causing the `pam_pkcs11` module to crash.\n*   Potential for privilege escalation (though considered difficult to exploit reliably).\n*   Potential for crashing PAM-using daemons.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by pressing `ctrl-c` or `ctrl-d` when prompted for a PIN by a service using `pam_pkcs11`.\n*   Local attack vector.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   Local access to the system.\n*   Ability to trigger a PIN prompt via a service using `pam_pkcs11` (e.g., `sudo su`).\n*   No privileges required.\n*   No user interaction beyond pressing `ctrl-c` or `ctrl-d`.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   Initialize the `password` variable to `NULL` before it is used. The suggested location is line 211 in `pam_pkcs11/src/pam_pkcs11/pam_pkcs11.c`.\n\n**CVSS Score:**\n\n*   CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:L (Overall score: /10)\n\n**Affected versions:**\n\n*   `< 0.6.12`\n\n**CVE ID:**\n\n*   CVE-2025-24031\n\n**Credits:**\n\n*   Reporter: [@bjorn3](https://github.com/bjorn3)",

CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference) is a potential consequence of using the uninitialized resource, as the uninitialized pointer could lead to a null pointer dereference when `cleanse` is called. CWE-908 is a child of CWE-665 (Improper Control of Resource Management), indicating a broader class of resource management issues.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe908[\"CWE-908: Use of Uninitialized Resource\"]\n    cwe476[\"CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference\"]\n    cwe665[\"CWE-665: Improper Control of Resource Management\"]\n\n    cwe908 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe476\n    cwe908 -->|CHILDOF| cwe665\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe908 primary\n    class cwe476 secondary\n    class cwe665 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the **missing initialization** of the `password` buffer (CWE-908). When the user presses `ctrl-c` or `ctrl-d`, the `pam_get_pwd` function fails to initialize this buffer. Subsequently, the `cleanse` function attempts to dereference this **uninitialized pointer**, leading to a potential **NULL pointer dereference** (CWE-476) and a crash.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-908 as the primary weakness due to the **uninitialized pointer**. This aligns with the description stating that `pam_get_pwd` never initializes the `password` buffer. The crash occurs because `cleanse` attempts to dereference this uninitialized pointer, potentially leading to a NULL pointer dereference (CWE-476).\n\nThe relationship analysis supports the selection of CWE-908 as the primary weakness, as it directly addresses the **missing initialization** of the resource. CWE-476 is a consequence.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately represent the root cause (CWE-908) and a potential immediate consequence (CWE-476) of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-252: Unchecked Return Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not check the return value from a method or function, which can prevent it from detecting unexpected states and conditions.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
