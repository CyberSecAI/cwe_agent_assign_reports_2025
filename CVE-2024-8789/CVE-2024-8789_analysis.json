  "description": "Lunary-ai/lunary version git 105a3f6 is vulnerable to a **Regular Expression Denial of Service** (ReDoS) attack. The application allows users to upload their own regular expressions, which are then executed on the server side. Certain regular expressions can have exponential runtime complexity relative to the input size, leading to potential denial of service. An attacker can exploit this by submitting a specially crafted regular expression, causing the server to become unresponsive for an arbitrary length of time.",

While other CWEs like CWE-400 (Resource Exhaustion) could be considered impacts, CWE-1333 directly addresses the root cause: an inefficient regular expression. There are no relevant parent-child relationships to consider in this specific case, since CWE-1333 is already at the base level.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1333[\"CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\"]\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe1333 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward:\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** CWE-1333 - Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity.
