Upon adding a new URL, the system retrieves the last sysmapelementurlid value and increments it by one. However, an issue arises when a user manually changes the sysmapelementurlid value by adding sysmapelementurlid + 1. This action prevents others from adding URLs to the map element.",

  "reference_content": "- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the way Zabbix handles `sysmapelementurlid` when adding URLs to map elements. The system increments the last `sysmapelementurlid` by one when a new URL is added. However, a user can manually change the `sysmapelementurlid` to a future value, which prevents other users from adding URLs to the same map element, as the system expects the next ID to be the current max + 1.\n\n- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is a race condition/sequence number issue in the logic that determines the `sysmapelementurlid`, leading to a denial of service.\n\n- **Impact of exploitation:** The impact is that a user can prevent other users from adding URLs to the map element, effectively leading to a denial of service for this feature.\n\n- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves a user manually modifying the `sysmapelementurlid` to an arbitrarily high number, causing subsequent attempts to add URLs to fail.\n\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the ability to add URLs to map elements. They also need to be able to manipulate the `sysmapelementurlid`.",

CWE-400, Uncontrolled Resource Consumption, is a Class level CWE and a potential consequence of the race condition. There are no direct parent-child relationships relevant in this case. The vulnerability chain suggests that a race condition leads to a denial of service. Abstraction levels influenced the choice, favoring the more specific Base CWE-362 over the broader Class CWE-400 as the primary weakness.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Race Condition\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    \n    cwe362 -->|CAN_CAUSE| cwe400\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe362 primary\n    class cwe400 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **Race Condition** (CWE-362) due to the way `sysmapelementurlid` is handled. A user can manipulate the value, causing a **Denial of Service** (CWE-400) by preventing others from adding URLs.\n  - **Root Cause:** CWE-362 (Race Condition)\n  - **Impact:** CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption leading to Denial of Service)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference. The core issue stems from the handling of `sysmapelementurlid`, which can be manipulated by a user, leading to a race condition when multiple users attempt to add URLs. This effectively causes a denial of service.\n\nThe relationship graph shows how the race condition can lead to resource consumption issues and ultimately a denial of service.\n\nCWE-362 is chosen because it directly addresses the **race condition** caused by the improper handling of the `sysmapelementurlid`. CWE-400 is considered a secondary impact as the **denial of service** stems from the **race condition**. These CWEs are at appropriate levels of specificity, with CWE-362 being a Base CWE and CWE-400 a Class CWE representing the broader impact.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n\n\n## CWE-294: Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA capture-replay flaw exists when the design of the product makes it possible for a malicious user to sniff network traffic and bypass authentication by replaying it to the server in question to the same effect as the original message (or with minor changes).\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-346: Origin Validation Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly verify that the source of data or communication is valid.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
