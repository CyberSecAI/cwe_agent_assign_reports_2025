# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-22117

## Vulnerability Description
When a URL is added to the map element, it is recorded in the database with sequential IDs. Upon adding a new URL, the system retrieves the last sysmapelementurlid value and increments it by one. However, an issue arises when a user manually changes the sysmapelementurlid value by adding sysmapelementurlid + 1. This action prevents others from adding URLs to the map element.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** prevents others from adding URLs to the map element
- **vector:** manually changing the sysmapelementurlid value by adding sysmapelementurlid + 1
- **attacker:** user

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the way Zabbix handles `sysmapelementurlid` when adding URLs to map elements. The system increments the last `sysmapelementurlid` by one when a new URL is added. However, a user can manually change the `sysmapelementurlid` to a future value, which prevents other users from adding URLs to the same map element, as the system expects the next ID to be the current max + 1.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is a race condition/sequence number issue in the logic that determines the `sysmapelementurlid`, leading to a denial of service.

- **Impact of exploitation:** The impact is that a user can prevent other users from adding URLs to the map element, effectively leading to a denial of service for this feature.

- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves a user manually modifying the `sysmapelementurlid` to an arbitrarily high number, causing subsequent attempts to add URLs to fail.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the ability to add URLs to map elements. They also need to be able to manipulate the `sysmapelementurlid`.
