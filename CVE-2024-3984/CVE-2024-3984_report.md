# Analysis Report for CVE-2024-3984

# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-3984

## Description

The EmbedSocial - Social Media Feeds, Reviews and Galleries plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugins embedsocial_reviews shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.29 due to **insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Rootcause:** insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes
- **Weakness:** cross-site scripting
- **Impact:** inject arbitrary web scripts
- **Attacker:** authenticated attackers
- **Product:** ['EmbedSocial - Social Media Feeds', 'Reviews and Galleries']
- **Version:** all versions up to and including 1.1.29
- **Component:** embedsocial_reviews shortcode

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain is as follows:
1.  **Root Cause:** **Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes**
2.  **Weakness:** CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
3.  **Impact:** Arbitrary web scripts are injected and executed in a user's browser

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is based on the provided evidence, which clearly indicates that the root cause of the vulnerability is **insufficient input sanitization and output escaping**, leading to a stored XSS vulnerability. The `embedsocial_reviews` shortcode in the EmbedSocial plugin fails to properly neutralize user-controllable input, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts into pages. This directly corresponds to CWE-79. The retriever results also list CWE-79 as a strong candidate.

The relationship graph is relatively simple due to the direct nature of the vulnerability. CWE-79 is a Base level CWE, which is the preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

I considered CWE-116 (Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output), but while related, CWE-79 more accurately captures the specific nature of the XSS vulnerability. CWE-116 is a more general class of weakness.
I also considered CWE-80 (Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)), but CWE-79 is more appropriate because the vulnerability is not limited to just HTML tags, it is a more general XSS.
I also considered CWE-352 (Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)), but it's not relevant as this is an XSS vulnerability, not a CSRF.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
**Abstraction Level**: Compound
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.



## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as "<", ">", and "&" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-96: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Statically Saved Code ('Static Code Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Base

## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
