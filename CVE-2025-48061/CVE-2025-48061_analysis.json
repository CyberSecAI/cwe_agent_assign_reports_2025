  "description": "wire-webapp is the web application for the open-source messaging service Wire. A change caused a regression resulting in sessions not being properly invalidated. A user that logged out of the Wire webapp, could have been automatically logged in again after re-opening the application. This does not happen when the user is logged in as a temporary user by selecting This is a public computer during login or the user selects Delete all your personal information and conversations on this device upon logout. The underlying issue has been fixed with wire-webapp version 2025-05-20-production.0. As a workaround, this behavior can be prevented by either deleting all information upon logout as well as logging in as a temporary client.",

The retriever results also support this selection. No parent-child or chain relationships significantly influenced the decision in this specific case, as the evidence directly points to session expiration issues.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe613[\"CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe613 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward:\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Insufficient session invalidation** (**CWE-613**) after user logout due to a regression.\n2.  **Impact:** User is automatically logged in again after re-opening the application.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the direct evidence from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary which states: \"**Root cause of vulnerability:** A recently introduced change caused a regression resulting in sessions not being properly invalidated after user logout.\" and \"**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insufficient session invalidation after user logout.\" This directly aligns with **CWE-613** (Insufficient Session Expiration).
