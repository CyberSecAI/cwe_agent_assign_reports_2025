- **vector:** manipulation of txtuname argument
- **product:** itsourcecode Library Management System
- **version:** 1
- **component:** Search in Forgot.java

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
CVE-2025-3245 is related to the content.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The code directly concatenates user input into SQL query strings without any parameterization or input validation, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
SQL Injection Vulnerability (CWE-89: SQL Injection)

**Impact of exploitation:**
* Unauthorized access to database information
* Potential exposure of sensitive information (such as user passwords)
* Possible database corruption or data manipulation

**Attack vectors:**
* Attackers can manipulate SQL query structure using special characters
* Additional information can be extracted using UNION queries
* Database information can be obtained through boolean-based blind injection
* Error-based injection might reveal more information

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker with the ability to provide input to the `txtuname` or `txtanswer` fields in the `Forgot.java` file.

**Mitigation or fix:**
1. Implement Prepared Statements
2. Input Validation
3. Implement principle of least privilege
4. Encrypt sensitive data storage
5. Implement WAF protection
6. Conduct regular security audits
7. Use ORM frameworks for database operations

**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**
The vulnerability is present in the `library_management/src/Library_Management/Forgot.java` file, specifically in the `search()` and `retrive()` methods.  The content provides example attack payloads. The severity is rated as HIGH.
