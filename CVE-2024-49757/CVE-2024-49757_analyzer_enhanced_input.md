## Vulnerability Description
The open-source identity infrastructure software Zitadel allows administrators to disable the user self-registration. Due to a **missing security check** in versions prior to 2.64.0, 2.63.5, 2.62.7, 2.61.4, 2.60.4, 2.59.5, and 2.58.7, disabling the User Registration allowed option only hid the registration button on the login page. Users could bypass this restriction by directly accessing the registration URL (/ui/login/loginname) and register a user that way. Versions 2.64.0, 2.63.5, 2.62.7, 2.61.4, 2.60.4, 2.59.5, and 2.58.7 contain a patch. No known workarounds are available.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-49757

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing security check in ZITADEL's user self-registration process. Specifically, disabling the "User Registration allowed" option only hid the registration button on the login page, but it did not prevent direct access to the registration URL (/ui/login/loginname).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Access Control:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper access control. The application failed to enforce the "User Registration allowed" setting at the URL level, allowing users to bypass the intended restriction.
- **UI-Based Security:** Relying solely on hiding the registration button on the UI was insufficient for security, as the underlying functionality was still accessible via direct URL manipulation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Bypass of Intended Security Controls:** Attackers could bypass the administrator's attempt to disable self-registration and create new user accounts, despite the configuration.
- **Potential for Unauthorized Access:** The exploitation could lead to unauthorized user accounts being created within the system, which can be further used for malicious activities.
- **Compromised System Integrity:** The ability to bypass registration controls compromises the integrity of the user management system, potentially leading to further security breaches.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct URL Access:** Attackers could bypass the registration setting by directly accessing the registration URL: `/ui/login/loginname`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Special Privileges Required:** The attacker does not require any special privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Network Access:** The attacker only needs network access to the application to reach the vulnerable URL.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is addressed in versions 2.58.7, 2.59.5, 2.60.4, 2.61.4, 2.62.7, 2.63.5, and 2.64.0 and later.
- The CVSS score is 7.5, categorized as "High" severity. The vector is CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N, indicating a network-based attack with low complexity, no required privileges or user interaction, and high confidentiality impact.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

### Extended Description


If a web product does not properly protect assumed-immutable values from modification in hidden form fields, parameters, cookies, or URLs, this can lead to modification of critical data. Web applications often mistakenly make the assumption that data passed to the client in hidden fields or cookies is not susceptible to tampering. Improper validation of data that are user-controllable can lead to the application processing incorrect, and often malicious, input.


For example, custom cookies commonly store session data or persistent data across sessions. This kind of session data is normally involved in security related decisions on the server side, such as user authentication and access control. Thus, the cookies might contain sensitive data such as user credentials and privileges. This is a dangerous practice, as it can often lead to improper reliance on the value of the client-provided cookie by the server side application.


### Alternative Terms
Assumed-Immutable Parameter Tampering

- **CVE-2000-0253:** Shopping cart allows price modification via hidden form field.
- **CVE-2000-0254:** Shopping cart allows price modification via hidden form field.




## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
AuthZ: "AuthZ" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authorization" within the web application security community. It is distinct from "AuthN" (or, sometimes, "AuthC") which is an abbreviation of "authentication." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.

### Additional Notes
**[Other]** The main difference between the use of hard-coded passwords and the use of hard-coded cryptographic keys is the false sense of security that the former conveys. Many people believe that simply hashing a hard-coded password before storage will protect the information from malicious users. However, many hashes are reversible (or at least vulnerable to brute force attacks) -- and further, many authentication protocols simply request the hash itself, making it no better than a password.
