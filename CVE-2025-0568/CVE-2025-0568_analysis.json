  "description": "Sante PACS Server DCM File Parsing Memory Corruption Denial-of-Service Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to create a denial-of-service condition on affected installations of Sante PACS Server. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of DCM files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a memory corruption condition. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to create a denial-of-service condition on the system. Was ZDI-CAN-25302.",

CWE-787 is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), indicating a more general class of memory safety issues. The vulnerability description highlights a **memory corruption** due to **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which aligns with the nature of out-of-bounds writes. CWE-20 is a class-level CWE that is too general, but it is related to the **root cause** of the **lack of validation**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe20 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe787\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, leading to a **memory corruption condition**, and ultimately resulting in a denial-of-service.\n\n*   **Root Cause:** **Lack of proper validation of user-supplied data** (CWE-20)\n*   **Weakness:** **Memory corruption** (CWE-787)\n*   **Impact:** Denial-of-Service\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-787 as the primary candidate due to the explicit mention of **memory corruption**. The retriever results also ranked CWE-787 as the top candidate. The **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data** is a contributing factor, which suggests CWE-20.\n\nThe graph relationships show that CWE-787 is a specific type of memory safety issue (child of CWE-119), and it can be preceded by improper input validation (CWE-20).\n\nThe selected CWEs are at an appropriate level of specificity. CWE-787 accurately describes the **memory corruption** caused by out-of-bounds write, and CWE-20 indicates the **root cause** of the **lack of input validation**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
