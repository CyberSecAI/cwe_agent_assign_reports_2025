CWE-89 is a child of CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')) and CWE-943 (Insufficient Verification or Neutralization of Special Elements). The secondary CWE is CWE-20, which is a class-level CWE that describes **improper input validation**. CWE-20 is a parent of CWE-89, indicating that the **SQL Injection** is a result of **improper input validation**.
