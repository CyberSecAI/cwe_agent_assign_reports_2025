It provides detailed information about a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the pwn.college DOJO.\n\nHere's an extraction of the relevant information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nMissing access control on rendering custom (unprivileged) dojo pages.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)\n*   CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n*   CWE-284: Improper Access Control\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nWebsite users may perform dangerous actions without their knowledge. (High Confidentiality, Low Integrity)\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n1.  Create a git repository.\n2.  Add an HTML file with arbitrary JS scripts.\n3.  Add a `dojo.yml` file with an entry in `pages` pointing to that HTML file.\n4.  Commit and push the repository.\n5.  Create or update a dojo with that repository.\n6.  Navigate to the new custom page.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   Ability to create and push to a git repository.\n*   Ability to create or update a dojo with that repository.\n*   Low privileges required.\n*   User interaction is required (navigate to the custom page).\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\nThe content does not specify a fix or mitigation, only that there are no patched versions as of Jan 30, 2025.\n\n**CVSS Score:** 7.6\n\n**CVSS v3 base metrics:**\n\n*   Attack Vector: Network (AV:N)\n*   Attack Complexity: Low (AC:L)\n*   Privileges Required: Low (PR:L)\n*   User Interaction: Required (UI:R)\n*   Scope: Changed (S:C)\n*   Confidentiality: High (C:H)\n*   Integrity: Low (I:L)\n*   Availability: None (A:N)\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   Specific steps to reproduce the vulnerability (PoC).\n*   CVSS vector string (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:N).\n*   Credit to the reporter (@cjreed121).\n*   Affected versions: <= a9abd7220b647206b467822912be0258445b13d6\n*   No patched versions available as of Jan 30, 2025.",

The **missing access control** allows unauthorized users to inject scripts, which are then stored and executed, leading to the XSS vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n\n    cwe79 -->|CAUSED_BY| cwe862\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe79 primary\n    class cwe862 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **CWE-862 (Missing Authorization)**, where there is a **lack of access control**. This leads to a user injecting malicious scripts without proper authorization. Subsequently, the injected script is not properly neutralized, resulting in **CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting'))**. This results in stored XSS.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified two key weaknesses: **missing access control** and **stored XSS**. The retriever results and the CVE content confirm the relevance of CWE-79. The guidance on Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control helps to correctly map the **missing access control** to **CWE-862 (Missing Authorization)**.\n\nThe evidence provided is strong, with explicit mentions of \"**Missing access control**\" as the root cause and \"**stored XSS**\" as the weakness. The CVE reference further validates these findings by listing both **CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting'))** and **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)**. However, given the clearer root cause of **missing access control**, CWE-862 is a more appropriate fit than the more general CWE-284.\n\n**CWEs Considered But Not Used:**\n\n*   **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)**: While related, **CWE-862 (Missing Authorization)** is more specific and accurately reflects the root cause of the vulnerability.\n*   **CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function)**: This is not the primary issue, as the problem lies in the **lack of authorization** for specific actions after authentication.\n*   **CWE-352 (Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF))**: Not applicable as the vulnerability does not involve forging requests.\n*   **CWE-434 (Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type)**: Not applicable as the vulnerability does not involve file uploads.\n*   **CWE-290 (Authentication Bypass by Spoofing)**: Not applicable as the vulnerability does not involve bypassing authentication.\n*   **CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication)**: Not applicable as the vulnerability does not involve weak authentication.\n*   **CWE-116 (Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output)**: While related to XSS, **CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting'))** is a more direct and specific classification.\n*   **CWE-80 (Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS))**: **CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting'))** is more appropriate as it is a more general form of XSS and is the classification given in the CVE content.\n*   **CWE-471 (Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID))**: Not applicable as the vulnerability does not involve modification of assumed-immutable data.\n*   **CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization)**: Not applicable as the vulnerability involves missing authorization checks, not incorrect ones.\n*   **CWE-425 (Direct Request ('Forced Browsing'))**: Not applicable as the vulnerability does not involve direct requests.\n*   **CWE-41 (Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence)**: Not applicable as the vulnerability does not involve path equivalence.\n*   **CWE-113 (Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting'))**: Not applicable as the vulnerability does not involve CRLF sequences in HTTP headers.\n*   **CWE-1275 (Sensitive Cookie with Improper SameSite Attribute)**: Not applicable as the vulnerability does not involve cookies.\n*   **CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection'))**: Not applicable as the vulnerability is specifically XSS.\n*   **CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key)**: Not applicable as the vulnerability does not involve user-controlled keys.\n*   **CWE-212 (Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer)**: Not applicable as the vulnerability does not involve the removal of sensitive information.\n*   **CWE-923 (Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints)**: Not applicable as the vulnerability does not involve communication channels.\n*   **CWE-184 (Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs)**: Not applicable as the vulnerability does not involve a list of disallowed inputs.\n*   **CWE-807 (Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision)**: Not applicable as the vulnerability does not involve security decisions based on untrusted inputs.",
