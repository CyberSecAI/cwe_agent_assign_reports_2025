This allows attackers to unsubscribe users from product notifications by manipulating the 'key' value.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\\n- Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR): The lack of proper authorization checks on the 'key' parameter allows attackers to directly manipulate data (user subscriptions) by referencing the internal key.\\n- Missing authorization: The AJAX action `woof_messenger_remove_subscr` does not properly validate if the user making the request has the permission to unsubscribe the targeted user.\\n- Insufficient input validation: The 'key' parameter is sanitized with `sanitize_key` function but not validated against the user ID before unsubscription.\\n\\n**Impact of exploitation:**\\nAn authenticated attacker (with subscriber-level access or higher) can unsubscribe other users from product notification sign-ups. This can disrupt the notification service and potentially affect a large number of users who rely on those notifications.\\n\\n**Attack vectors:**\\n- The attacker needs to send a crafted AJAX request to `woof_messenger_remove_subscr` action with the user ID and the targeted user's subscription 'key'.\\n- The attacker can try to brute-force the 'key' values, if they are not generated with sufficient randomness.\\n\\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\\n- The attacker needs to be authenticated on the WordPress site with at least subscriber-level access.\\n- The Products Messenger extension of the plugin must be enabled on the WordPress site.\\n- The attacker needs to obtain or brute-force the key value associated with the user's subscription.\\n\\n**Additional details from the provided content:**\\n- The vulnerability was discovered by shaman0x01 from Shaman Red Team.\\n- The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.3.6.2 and later.\\n- The fix includes an additional check in the  `woof_messenger_remove_subscr` function in `ext/products_messenger/index.php` to compare the current user's id to the `user_id` parameter in the request before proceeding with the unsubscription.\\n- The `readme.txt` and `index.php` files confirm the change in version number from 1.3.6.2 to 1.3.6.3, indicating a patch was released.\", similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {}, 'top_cwes_by_threshold': {}}}, similarity_summary=SimilarityInsight(consensus_cwe='', top_cwes=[], confidence_levels={}, total_samples=0), analysis='', analysis_with_relationships='', criticism='', resolution='', relevant_cwes=[{'metadata': {'doc_id': '639', 'name': 'Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': \"The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\", 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'rootcause:Insecure Direct Object Reference', 'keyphrase': 'Insecure Direct Object Reference', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'rootcause:missing validation on the key user controlled key', 'keyphrase': 'missing validation on the key user controlled key', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'impact:unsubscribe users from product notification sign-ups', 'keyphrase': 'unsubscribe users from product notification sign-ups', 'type': 'impact'}, {'id': 'attacker:authenticated attackers with subscriber-level access and above', 'keyphrase': 'authenticated attackers with subscriber-level access and above', 'type': 'attacker'}, {'id': 'product:HUSKY -

    "enhanced_query": "# Vulnerability Description\n\n    The HUSKY - Products Filter Professional for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to **Insecure Direct Object Reference** in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.6.1 via the woof_messenger_remove_subscr AJAX action due to **missing validation on the key user controlled key**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to unsubscribe users from a product notification sign-ups, if they can successfully obtain or brute force the key value for users who signed up to receive notifications. This vulnerability requires the plugins Products Messenger extension to be enabled.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'Insecure Direct Object Reference'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1.
