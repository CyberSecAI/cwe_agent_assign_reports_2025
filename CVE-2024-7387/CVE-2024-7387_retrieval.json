  "vulnerability_info": "VulnerabilityInfo(cve_id='CVE-2024-7387', description='A flaw was found in openshift/builder. This vulnerability allows **command injection** via **path traversal**, where a malicious user can execute arbitrary commands on the OpenShift node running the builder container. When using the Docker strategy, executable files inside the privileged build container can be overridden using the `spec.source.secrets.secret.destinationDir` attribute of the `BuildConfig` definition. An attacker running code in a privileged container could escalate their permissions on the node running the container.', key_phrases={'rootcause': '', 'weakness': ['command injection', 'path traversal'], 'impact': 'execute arbitrary commands', 'vector': '', 'attacker': 'malicious user', 'product': 'openshift/builder', 'version': '', 'component': ''}, reference_content='Based on the provided content, here\\'s an analysis of CVE-2024-7387:\\n\\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\\nThe vulnerability stems from a path traversal issue within the `openshift/builder` component when using the \"docker build\" strategy in OpenShift. Specifically, the `spec.source.secrets.secret.destinationDir` attribute in the `BuildConfig` definition allows an attacker to specify an arbitrary destination directory within the build container\\'s file system when copying secret files. This can be exploited using symbolic links to overwrite files in other locations within the container.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\\n\\n*   **Path Traversal:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper sanitization or validation of the `destinationDir` path, allowing path traversal outside the intended target directory.\\n*   **Command Injection:** By using a symbolic link and path traversal, an attacker can overwrite existing executable files within the privileged build container (e.g., `/usr/bin/cp`). Subsequently, when the overwritten executable is invoked by the build process (by another secret), it allows arbitrary command execution within the privileged build container.\\n*   **Privileged Container:** The fact that the build processes run within a privileged container exacerbates the vulnerability, as arbitrary code execution inside such container gives access to the host node.\\n\\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\\n\\n*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands within the context of the privileged build container.\\n*   **Node Compromise:** By running code in the privileged container, an attacker can potentially escalate their privileges on the cluster and the host node. This could involve mounting the host filesystem and adding new SSH keys to the `core` user of Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS), leading to full node compromise.\\n*   **Cluster Takeover:** Successful exploitation can compromise the entire OpenShift cluster.\\n\\n**Attack Vectors:**\\n\\n*   **Malicious BuildConfig:** The primary attack vector is through the creation of a malicious `BuildConfig` that leverages the vulnerable `destinationDir` attribute.\\n*   **Git Repository:** An attacker needs control of a Git repository, to host a Dockerfile and symlinks.\\n*   **Secret Manipulation:** The attacker crafts two secrets. One containing the malicious payload and the second just to trigger the execution of the replaced binary.\\n\\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\\n\\n*   **Ability to Create Builds:** An attacker must have the ability to create `BuildConfig` objects within an OpenShift cluster.\\n*   **Access to a Git Repository:** The attacker needs to control or have access to a Git repository to host a Dockerfile containing a symbolic link.\\n*   **Basic understanding of OpenShift Build Process:** The attacker must understand how the build process works in OpenShift, specifically the docker strategy.\\n\\n**Technical Details:**\\n\\n*   The vulnerability exists in the `DockerBuilder.copySecrets` and `DockerBuilder.copyLocalObject` functions within the `pkg/build/builder/docker.go` file of the `openshift/builder` project.\\n*   The `copyLocalObject` function doesn\\'t perform adequate validation, which allows the attacker to use a symbolic link within a git repository to specify a `destinationDir` that points to a sensitive location within the build container\\'s filesystem, like `/usr/bin`.\\n*   The `cp` command is used to copy the content of the secrets to the destination path.\\n*   When a second secret is processed, the replaced `cp` command is executed, triggering the injected payload inside the privileged container.\\n\\n**Additional notes:**\\n\\n*   The provided content includes a detailed Proof of Concept (PoC), demonstrating how to exploit the vulnerability.\\n*   Multiple Red Hat Security Advisories (RHSAs) were issued to address this vulnerability across different versions of OpenShift Container Platform.\\n\\nThe provided information gives a comprehensive understanding of the vulnerability and it\\'s exploitation.', similar_info={'cwe_distribution':

    "enhanced_query": "# Vulnerability Description\n\n    A flaw was found in openshift/builder. This vulnerability allows **command injection** via **path traversal**, where a malicious user can execute arbitrary commands on the OpenShift node running the builder container. When using the Docker strategy, executable files inside the privileged build container can be overridden using the `spec.source.secrets.secret.destinationDir` attribute of the `BuildConfig` definition. An attacker running code in a privileged container could escalate their permissions on the node running the container.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## WEAKNESS: 'command injection'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this WEAKNESS:\n\n### 1.
