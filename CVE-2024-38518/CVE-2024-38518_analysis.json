  "description": "BigBlueButton is an open-source virtual classroom designed to help teachers teach and learners learn. An attacker with a valid join link to a meeting can trick BigBlueButton into generating a signed join link with additional parameters. One of those parameters may be role=moderator, allowing an attacker to join a meeting as moderator using a join link that was originally created for viewer access. This vulnerability has been patched in version(s) 2.6.18, 2.7.8 and 3.0.0-alpha.7.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-38518:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of parameters in the BigBlueButton API, specifically within the `join` API endpoint. An attacker could manipulate the request parameters to generate a signed join link with elevated privileges, specifically the `role=moderator` parameter.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Insecure Parameter Handling:** The BigBlueButton API didn't properly validate or sanitize parameters passed to the `join` API. This allowed an attacker to inject arbitrary parameters.\n*   **Missing Content-Type Header Validation:** The API did not enforce the presence of a `Content-Type` header for POST requests, allowing requests with manipulated parameters to be processed.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Privilege Escalation:** By injecting the `role=moderator` parameter, an attacker could join a meeting as a moderator, even with a join link intended for a viewer.\n*   **Unauthorized Access:** The attacker gains full control of the meeting, enabling them to disrupt, eavesdrop on, or manipulate the session.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Network-based Attack:** The attacker would exploit this vulnerability via HTTP requests to the BigBlueButton server.\n*   **Join Link Manipulation:** An attacker with a valid join link for a meeting (even a viewer link) can exploit this vulnerability.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Knowledge of API:** The attacker needs some knowledge of BigBlueButton's API structure and parameters.\n*   **Valid Meeting Join Link:** The attacker needs a valid join link for a meeting, which could be obtained through various means.\n*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the BigBlueButton server.\n\n**Additional details:**\n\n* The vulnerability was addressed by:\n    *   Removing support for POST requests to the `join` API.\n    *   Enforcing the presence of a `Content-Type` header for POST requests to the API, which must match the supported content type.\n    *   Defining supported content types for each request.\n    *   Fixing checksum calculation for POST requests.\n*   The vulnerability affects BigBlueButton versions prior to 2.7.8\n*   Patches were released for versions 2.6.18, 2.7.8 and 3.0.0-alpha.7.\n*   The vulnerability was responsibly reported by `@defnull`.\n\nThis analysis provides more detail than the official CVE description, explaining the specific mechanism and remediation steps.",

While it's generally preferable to choose a Base or Variant level CWE, the provided information doesn't give enough details to pinpoint the exact authorization mechanism that failed. CWE-863 serves as a suitable high-level classification, indicating that authorization checks were present but flawed.\n\nCWE-472, \"External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter,\" is a Base-level CWE. It describes a scenario where the application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable. This is relevant to the vulnerability description, as the attacker is manipulating the `role` parameter in the join link.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe472[\"CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\"]\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe472 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the **improper handling of parameters** within the BigBlueButton API, specifically the `join` API endpoint. This leads to the ability to inject arbitrary parameters, such as `role=moderator`. The final impact is privilege escalation, allowing an attacker to join a meeting as a moderator with unauthorized access.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-863, Incorrect Authorization, as the primary weakness due to the **improper access control** allowing an attacker to join a meeting as a moderator. The evidence supporting this includes the vulnerability description key phrases and the CVE reference links content summary stating that an attacker can manipulate parameters to gain elevated privileges.\n\nThe retriever results listed several candidate CWEs, including CWE-863, CWE-73, CWE-284, CWE-285, CWE-22, CWE-201, CWE-20, CWE-940, CWE-472, and CWE-59. Of these, CWE-863 and CWE-472 were the most relevant.\n\nCWE-863 directly addresses the authorization issue, while CWE-472 highlights the **external control** aspect. The decision to include both CWEs provides a more complete picture of the vulnerability. The selection of CWE-863 as the primary CWE is based on the root cause being a flaw in the authorization mechanism.\n\nThe chosen CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity given the available information. While a more specific child of CWE-863 might exist, the current description doesn't provide sufficient details to pinpoint the exact authorization failure. Similarly, CWE-472 is a good base level description for the external control of web parameters.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n* **CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization:** The product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check. The vulnerability description clearly indicates that an attacker can bypass the intended authorization by manipulating the `role` parameter.\n* **CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter:** The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields. In this case, the `role` parameter, likely assumed to be controlled server-side, is being manipulated by the attacker.\n\nCWEs Considered but Not Used:\n\n* **CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path:** This CWE is not applicable because the vulnerability does not involve file names or paths.\n* **CWE-284: Improper Access Control:** While this is a general access control issue, CWE-863 is more specific to the authorization aspect, making it a better fit.\n* **CWE-285: Improper Authorization:** This is similar to CWE-863, but CWE-863 is a better fit because it more directly captures the \"incorrect\" aspect of the authorization, rather than just a general \"improper\" authorization.\n* **CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal'):** This CWE is not relevant as the vulnerability is not related to path traversal.\n* **CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data:** Not relevant as it doesn't involve sensitive information being inserted into data.\n* **CWE-20: Improper Input Validation:** While input validation is related, CWE-472 specifically covers the external control of parameters, making it a better fit for the secondary weakness.\n* **CWE-940: Improper Verification of Source of a Communication Channel:** This CWE is not applicable as the vulnerability is not about verifying the source of a communication channel.\n* **CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following'):** Not relevant as it is about file access using links.",
