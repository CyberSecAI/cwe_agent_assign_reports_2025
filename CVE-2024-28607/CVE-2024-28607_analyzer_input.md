# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-28607

## Vulnerability Description
The ip-utils package through 2.4.0 for Node.js might allow SSRF because some IP addresses (such as 0x7f.1) are improperly categorized as globally routable via a falsy isPrivate return value.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** SSRF
- **product:** ip-utils package for Node.js
- **version:** through 2.4.0

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2024-28607 based on provided content

The provided content is **RELEVANT** to CVE-2024-28607. It details a vulnerability in the `isPrivate()` function of the `ip-utils` NPM package. Here's a breakdown of the information extracted:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The `isPrivate()` function uses regular expressions to identify private IP addresses. These regular expressions are not comprehensive enough and allow for bypasses with non-standard or octal representations of IP addresses.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Incomplete regular expression for private IP address detection.
*   Failure to properly sanitize or validate IP address input.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Attackers can bypass security controls relying on private IP detection.
*   Potential for Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).
*   Potential for access control bypass.
*   Potential for information leakage.

**Attack vectors:**

*   Providing a crafted IP address string to the `isPrivate()` function that bypasses the regular expression checks. Examples include:
    *   `"0x7f.1"` (hexadecimal representation of 127.0.0.1)
    *   `"127.1"` (shorthand for 127.0.0.1)
    *   `"0177.0.0.1"` (octal representation of 127.0.0.1)

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to control the IP address input that is passed to the `isPrivate()` function. This could be through a web application, API, or other interface.

**Mitigation or fix:**

The content does not explicitly state a fix, but implies that a more robust and comprehensive regular expression, or additional input validation, is required to correctly identify private IP addresses.

**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**

The content provides the specific source code of the vulnerable function (`isPrivate()`) and demonstrates concrete examples of bypasses, offering a deeper understanding of the vulnerability than a typical CVE description. It also links to the vulnerable code on GitHub.
