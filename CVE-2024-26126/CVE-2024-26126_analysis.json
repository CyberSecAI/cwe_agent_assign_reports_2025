This means that the software does not properly validate user-supplied input, leading to potential security issues.\n-  **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could result in a security feature bypass, potentially allowing an attacker to circumvent security measures within the application.\n- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based (AV:N), with a low attack complexity (AC:L).\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a low-privileged user (PR:L) and requires user interaction (UI:R) to trigger the vulnerability. The scope is unchanged (S:U), and the impact is limited to low integrity (I:L) without affecting confidentiality or availability.\n\nThe provided information gives a more detailed breakdown of the vulnerability, including the specific CWE and CVSS vector, compared to the standard CVE description.",
