The original issue 1097 report stated The latest version of Netatalk (v3.2.0) contains a security vulnerability. This vulnerability arises due to a **lack of validation** for the length field after parsing user-provided data, leading to an out-of-bounds heap write of one byte (\\\\0). Under specific configurations, this can result in reading metadata of the next heap block, potentially causing a Denial of Service (DoS) under certain heap layouts or with ASAN enabled. ... The vulnerability is located in the FPLoginExt operation of Netatalk, in the BN_bin2bn function found in /etc/uams/uams_dhx_pam.c ... if (!(bn = BN_bin2bn((unsigned char *)ibuf, KEYSIZE, NULL))) ... threads ...

Specifically, the `pam_login_ext` function does not properly validate the length of the username provided in the input buffer.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\\n- Heap out-of-bounds write: The lack of length validation allows a crafted input to write a null byte (`\\\\0`) beyond the allocated buffer.\\n- Input validation failure:  The code fails to validate the length of the user-provided username.\\n\\n**Impact of exploitation:**\\n- Denial of Service (DoS): Under specific configurations, particularly with ASAN enabled or specific heap layouts, the out-of-bounds write can overwrite heap metadata. This can lead to a crash and thus a denial of service.\\n- Potential for information leak: Overwriting heap metadata could potentially reveal information about the next heap block.\\n\\n**Attack vectors:**\\n- Network: The vulnerability is triggered through network requests to the Netatalk service.\\n- Specifically, it occurs during the authentication process using the `uams_dhx.so` module, particularly in the `FPLoginExt` operation.\\n\\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\\n- The attacker needs to send a specially crafted authentication request to the Netatalk server.\\n- The attacker does not need prior authentication or any special privileges.\\n\\n**Additional details:**\\n- The vulnerability is located in the `BN_bin2bn` function call within `uams_dhx_pam.c`, specifically within the `pam_login_ext` function.\\n- The vulnerability was introduced in Netatalk version 1.5.0.\\n- The vulnerability affects Netatalk versions prior to 3.2.1, as well as older versions such as 3.0.0 - 3.1.18 and 1.5.0 - 2.4.0.\\n- A patch is available with git hash `77b5d99`.\\n- Upgrading to Netatalk versions 2.4.1, 3.1.19, and 3.2.1 resolves this vulnerability.\\n- A workaround is to disable the `uams_dhx.so` authentication module in the `afp.conf` configuration file.\\n\\nThe provided content contains a detailed explanation of the vulnerability, its location, how it can be triggered, its impact, and how to fix it, providing more detail than the standard CVE description.\", similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats':

    "enhanced_query": "# Vulnerability Description\n\n    Netatalk before 3.2.1 has an **off-by-one error**, and resultant **heap-based buffer overflow** and segmentation violation, because of incorrectly using FPLoginExt in BN_bin2bn in etc/uams/uams_dhx_pam.c. The original issue 1097 report stated The latest version of Netatalk (v3.2.0) contains a security vulnerability. This vulnerability arises due to a **lack of validation** for the length field after parsing user-provided data, leading to an out-of-bounds heap write of one byte (\\0). Under specific configurations, this can result in reading metadata of the next heap block, potentially causing a Denial of Service (DoS) under certain heap layouts or with ASAN enabled. ... The vulnerability is located in the FPLoginExt operation of Netatalk, in the BN_bin2bn function found in /etc/uams/uams_dhx_pam.c ... if (!(bn = BN_bin2bn((unsigned char *)ibuf, KEYSIZE, NULL))) ... threads ...
