# Vulnerability Description

    Netatalk before 3.2.1 has an **off-by-one error**, and resultant **heap-based buffer overflow** and segmentation violation, because of incorrectly using FPLoginExt in BN_bin2bn in etc/uams/uams_dhx_pam.c. The original issue 1097 report stated The latest version of Netatalk (v3.2.0) contains a security vulnerability. This vulnerability arises due to a **lack of validation** for the length field after parsing user-provided data, leading to an out-of-bounds heap write of one byte (\0). Under specific configurations, this can result in reading metadata of the next heap block, potentially causing a Denial of Service (DoS) under certain heap layouts or with ASAN enabled. ... The vulnerability is located in the FPLoginExt operation of Netatalk, in the BN_bin2bn function found in /etc/uams/uams_dhx_pam.c ... if (!(bn = BN_bin2bn((unsigned char *)ibuf, KEYSIZE, NULL))) ... threads ... [#0] Id 1, Name afpd, stopped 0x7ffff4304e58 in ?? (), reason SIGSEGV ...

    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'lack of validation'

Relevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:

### 1. CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read (Score: 882.11)

The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer....

### 2. CWE-193: Off-by-one Error (Score: 858.28)

A product calculates or uses an incorrect maximum or minimum value that is 1 more, or 1 less, than the correct value....

### 3. CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input (Score: 853.78)

The product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties....

### 4. CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow (Score: 838.81)

A heap overflow condition is a buffer overflow, where the buffer that can be overwritten is allocated in the heap portion of memory, generally meaning that the buffer was allocated using a routine such as malloc()....

### 5. CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound (Score: 826.44)

The product performs a calculation that can
         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic
         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than
         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is
         incremented to a value that is too large to st...
