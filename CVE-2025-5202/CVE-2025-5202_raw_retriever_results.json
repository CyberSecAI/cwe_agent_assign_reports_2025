  "query": "A vulnerability was found in Open Asset Import Library Assimp 5.4.3. It has been declared as problematic. Affected by this vulnerability is the function HL1MDLLoadervalidate_header of the file assimp/code/AssetLib/MDL/HalfLife/HL1MDLLoader.cpp. The manipulation leads to out-of-bounds read. An attack has to be approached locally. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The project decided to collect all Fuzzer bugs in a main-issue to address them in the future.",
