  "description": "A flaw was found in Quarkus-HTTP, which incorrectly parses cookies with certain value-delimiting characters in incoming requests. This issue could allow an attacker to construct a cookie value to exfiltrate HttpOnly cookie values or spoof arbitrary additional cookie values, leading to unauthorized data access or modification. The main threat from this flaw impacts data confidentiality and integrity.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-12397\n\n**Root Cause:**\n- The vulnerability stems from incorrect parsing of cookies by Quarkus HTTP when processing incoming requests. Specifically, the issue arises when cookie values contain certain value-delimiting characters.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Cookie Smuggling:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to manipulate cookie values due to incorrect parsing of value-delimiting characters. This enables an attacker to include their own data into cookie headers, potentially causing a \"cookie smuggling\" situation.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Exfiltration of HttpOnly cookies:** An attacker can craft a malicious cookie value to potentially extract the content of HttpOnly cookies which are normally inaccessible through client-side JavaScript\n- **Spoofing of Additional Cookie Values:** An attacker can inject additional arbitrary cookie values.\n- **Unauthorized Data Access or Modification:** By controlling or accessing cookie data, an attacker can achieve unauthorized access or modification of sensitive data\n- **Compromise of Data Confidentiality and Integrity:** The exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a breach of confidentiality by stealing cookies and a compromise of integrity by injecting malicious cookies.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Maliciously crafted HTTP Cookie Header:** The attacker needs to send an HTTP request that includes a crafted cookie header, which contains specially designed values.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. There does not appear to be any requirement for the attacker to be authenticated to exploit this flaw.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n- The affected component is `io.quarkus.http/quarkus-http-core`.\n- The description of the bug mentions \"certain value-delimiting characters\" but doesn't specify exactly which characters.\n- The Bugzilla entry contains references to \"Quarkus HTTP Cookie Smuggling,\" which further clarifies the nature of the vulnerability.",
