# Raw Analyzer Response for CVE-2025-1040

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-1336 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE: The **rootcause** is the **improper handling of user-supplied format strings** in the Jinja2 templating engine, which directly aligns with the description of CWE-1336. |
| CWE-95 | Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection') | 0.7 | Variant | Allowed | Secondary: While SSTI can lead to dynamic code evaluation, the primary issue is the template engine's vulnerability, making CWE-95 a related but less direct fit. |
| CWE-74 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection') | 0.5 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary: High-level injection weakness that applies, but CWE-1336 is more specific. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship influencing the selection is that CWE-1336 directly addresses the use of template engines and the **improper neutralization** of special elements within them. CWE-95 is a related variant focusing on dynamic code evaluation, which can be a consequence of SSTI but isn't the root cause. CWE-74 is a higher-level "Injection" class that is too generic, whereas CWE-1336 is a base level weakness that more accurately describes the vulnerability.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **improper handling of user-supplied format strings** (CWE-1336), leading to potential dynamic code evaluation (CWE-95) and ultimately resulting in Remote Code Execution (RCE).

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis focuses on the provided vulnerability description and the fix details, which clearly indicate a **Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)** due to **improper handling of user-supplied format strings**. The core issue stems from the use of an unsandboxed Jinja2 templating engine, allowing attackers to inject malicious code through crafted format strings.

The selection of CWE-1336 is strongly supported by the evidence, as it directly addresses the **improper neutralization** of special elements used in a template engine, which is the root cause of the vulnerability. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions the use of the Jinja2 templating engine and the **improper handling** of user-supplied format strings, aligning perfectly with CWE-1336. The fix involved implementing a sandboxed Jinja2 environment, further reinforcing the relevance of this CWE.

CWE-95 is considered as a secondary CWE because the SSTI can lead to dynamic code evaluation, but the primary issue remains the template engine vulnerability. CWE-74 is a more general injection weakness and is therefore not as precise as CWE-1336.

The high confidence in the mapping is based on the direct evidence from the vulnerability description, the fix details, and the relevance of CWE-1336 to the specific context of template injection vulnerabilities. The retriever scores also support the selection of CWE-1336 as a highly relevant CWE for this vulnerability.

CWE-20 was considered, but it was determined to be too high-level.
CWE-78, CWE-88, and CWE-89 were considered but found to be related to OS Command Injection and SQL Injection respectively, and were therefore not relevant.
CWE-120 and CWE-787 were considered but found to be related to Buffer Overflow and Out-of-bounds Write respectively, and were therefore not relevant.
