# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-12615

# Vulnerability Description

    The Passwords Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to **SQL Injection** via the $wpdb->prefix value in several AJAX actions in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.8 due to ****insufficient escaping** on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.
