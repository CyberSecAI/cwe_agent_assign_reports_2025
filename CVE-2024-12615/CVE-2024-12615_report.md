# Analysis Report for CVE-2024-12615

# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-12615

## Description

The Passwords Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to **SQL Injection** via the $wpdb->prefix value in several AJAX actions in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.8 due to ****insufficient escaping** on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Rootcause:** insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query
- **Weakness:** ['insufficient escaping', 'SQL Injection']
- **Impact:** extract sensitive information from the database
- **Attacker:** authenticated attackers
- **Product:** Passwords Manager WordPress plugin
- **Version:** all versions up to and including 1.4.8
- **Component:** ["'$wpdb->prefix value in several AJAX actions'", 'SQL query']

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-89 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE: **Insufficient escaping** on user-supplied parameters in SQL queries leads to SQL Injection. |
| CWE-116 | Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output | 0.7 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary CWE: Contributes to the **SQL Injection** by not properly encoding/escaping user input before it's used in the query. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is **CWE-89**, which stems from the **insufficient escaping** of user-supplied parameters in SQL queries. **CWE-116** is a related weakness, where improper encoding or escaping contributes to the SQL Injection. **CWE-89** is a child of **CWE-74** (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')), but **CWE-89** is more specific and therefore more appropriate. **CWE-116** is a class level CWE that might have more specific base level children.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **insufficient escaping** (**CWE-89**). This leads to the ability to inject SQL commands. Attackers can then use this to **extract sensitive information from the database**.
  - Root Cause: **CWE-89** Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')
  - Impact: Extraction of sensitive information from the database.

## Summary of Analysis
The primary vulnerability is a classic **SQL Injection** (**CWE-89**) due to **insufficient escaping** of user-supplied parameters. The vulnerability description clearly states: "The Passwords Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to **SQL Injection**... due to ****insufficient escaping** on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**." This directly points to **CWE-89**. While **CWE-116** is also relevant due to the **improper encoding or escaping of output**, it's a contributing factor rather than the root cause. Therefore, **CWE-89** is the primary CWE, and **CWE-116** is a secondary CWE.

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
**Abstraction Level**: Compound
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.



## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.
