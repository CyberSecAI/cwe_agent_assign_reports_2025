Similarly, CWE-415 (Double Free) and CWE-416 (Use After Free) were not selected because the description doesn't imply issues related to memory management like double freeing or use-after-free scenarios. CWE-123 (Write-what-where Condition) was also considered but deemed less specific than CWE-787, as the primary issue is writing outside the bounds rather than a general write-what-where condition.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the base level of abstraction, providing a detailed representation of the vulnerability.
