This vulnerability affects the function jx9MemObjStore of the file /data/src/benchmarks/unqlite/unqlite.c. The manipulation leads to **heap-based buffer overflow**. It is possible to launch the attack on the local host. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. Continious delivery with rolling releases is used by this product. Therefore, no version details of affected nor updated releases are available.",

  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-3791 Content\n\nBased on the provided content, this relates to a heap overflow vulnerability in the unqlite library.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nA heap buffer overflow occurs in the `jx9MemObjStore` function (located in `unqlite.c:31737`) when allocating memory via `SyOSHeapAlloc`. The AddressSanitizer report indicates a read of size 4 at an address 36 bytes to the left of an allocated region.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Heap buffer overflow.\n*   Insufficient bounds checking when writing to a heap-allocated buffer.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nThe heap buffer overflow could potentially lead to:\n\n*   Program crash (as demonstrated by the AddressSanitizer abort).\n*   Possible arbitrary code execution if the overflow can be controlled to overwrite critical data structures.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Providing a crafted `input.sql` file to the `unqlitec` executable. The issue was found using a concolic execution tool, suggesting the vulnerability is triggered by specific SQL commands or data within the input.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   An attacker needs to be able to provide an `input.sql` file that triggers the vulnerable code path. This could be through file upload, database interaction, or other means of providing input to the unqlite library.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\nThe content does not provide a specific fix. However, mitigation would involve:\n\n*   Implementing proper bounds checking in the `jx9MemObjStore` function to prevent writing beyond the allocated buffer.\n*   Reviewing the memory allocation and deallocation logic to ensure consistency and prevent potential overflows.\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   The vulnerability was discovered using a concolic execution tool.\n*   The specific Git commit where the vulnerability was found is `957c377cb691a4f617db9aba5cc46d90425071e2` (master branch).\n*   The issue was reproduced on x86\\_64 Ubuntu 18.04 using GCC 7.5.0 with address sanitization enabled.\n*   A reproducible test case (`unqlite-reproduce-heap-overflow.zip`) is provided.\n*   The vulnerable code is located in `/data/src/benchmarks/unqlite/unqlite.c`.\n*   The allocation is done via `SyOSHeapAlloc`.",

CWE-122 is a variant of CWE-119, providing more specific details about the location of the buffer (heap). Since the vulnerability description explicitly mentions a \"heap-based buffer overflow,\" CWE-122 is the more appropriate choice.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe122[\"CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    \n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe122 primary\n    class cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the **heap-based buffer overflow** due to the manipulation of the `jx9MemObjStore` function.
