While the vulnerability description mentions \"Authenticated attackers with Contributor-level access\", it suggests a potential **missing authorization** issue, making CWE-862 a secondary candidate.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe862 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe862 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a potential **missing authorization** check (CWE-862), allowing authenticated attackers with Contributor-level access to extract sensitive data, leading to **exposure of sensitive information** (CWE-200).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nBased on the vulnerability description, the primary issue is the **exposure of sensitive information** via the `get_image_description` function. The fact that \"authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above\" can extract this data implies a potential **missing authorization** check or an **incorrect authorization** check.\n\nThe vulnerability description explicitly states \"Sensitive Information Exposure\". The impact confirms the exposure of \"the content of private, draft, and scheduled posts and pages\". Therefore, CWE-200 is a strong candidate.\n\nCWE-862 is a good candidate because the vulnerability description mentions \"authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above\". This suggests that users with Contributor-level access are able to access data that they should not be able to access, indicating a **missing authorization** check. The retriever results listed CWE-862 as one of the top candidates.\n\nI am selecting CWE-200 and CWE-862, as they represent both the impact and a likely root cause.
