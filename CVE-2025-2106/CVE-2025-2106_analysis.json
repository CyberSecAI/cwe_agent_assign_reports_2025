  "description": "The ArielBrailovsky-ViralAd plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the text and id parameters of the limpia() function in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.8 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database. This only appears to be exploitable on very old versions of WordPress.",

CWE-89 represents the specific case of SQL Injection, which is a type of injection. CWE-116 is a class level CWE that could be a contributing factor. The abstraction levels influenced the decision to choose CWE-89 as the primary CWE since it is at the base level, providing a more specific description of the vulnerability than its parent, CWE-74.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    cwe116[\"CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\"]\n    \n    cwe89 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe89 primary\n    class cwe74,cwe116 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query** (root cause), leading to **SQL injection** (weakness), which allows attackers to **append additional SQL queries** and ultimately **extract sensitive information from the database** (impact).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE selected is CWE-89, as it directly addresses the **SQL Injection** vulnerability described in the provided text, where user-supplied parameters are not properly neutralized before being used in an SQL query. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions **\"insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query\"**, which aligns with the definition of CWE-89: \"The product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.\" The impact, described as the ability to **\"extract sensitive information from the database,\"** further supports this classification.\n\nCWE-116 was considered because the root cause includes **\"insufficient escaping\"**, which relates to encoding or escaping output. However, CWE-89 is more specific to the context of SQL queries and is therefore the more appropriate primary CWE. CWE-116 can be considered a secondary CWE.\n\nThe retriever results consistently highlighted CWE-89 as the top match for the given vulnerability description and keyphrases, reinforcing its suitability. The relationships (childof CWE-74) confirm the hierarchical organization.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
