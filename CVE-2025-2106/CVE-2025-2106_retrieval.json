    "enhanced_query": "# Vulnerability Description\n\n    The ArielBrailovsky-ViralAd plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the text and id parameters of the limpia() function in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.8 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.
