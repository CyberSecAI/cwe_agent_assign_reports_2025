  "reference_content": "The content relates to CVE-2025-4549. Here's the extracted information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\n*   A SQL injection vulnerability was found in the '/routers/register-router.php' file of the 'Online Food Ordering System' project. The reason for this issue is that attackers inject malicious code from the parameter 'name' and use it directly in SQL queries without the need for appropriate cleaning or validation.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   SQL injection\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   Attackers can exploit this SQL injection vulnerability to achieve unauthorized database access, sensitive data leakage, data tampering, comprehensive system control, and even service interruption.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   The 'name' parameter in `/routers/register-router.php` is vulnerable. No login or authorization is required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   No specific position or privileges are required. The vulnerability is exploitable without authentication.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   Use prepared statements and parameter binding.\n*   Input validation and filtering.\n*   Minimize database user permissions.\n*   Regular security audits.\n\n**Payload Example:**\n\n```\nParameter: name (POST)\n    Type: time-based blind\n    Title: MySQL >= 5.0.12 AND time-based blind (query SLEEP)\n    Payload: username=admin&name=111111' AND (SELECT 4085 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))Nqyn) AND 'eoqz'='eoqz&password=admin&phone=1234567890\n```\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   Affected Product: Online Food Ordering System V1.0\n*   Vulnerable File: `/routers/register-router.php`\n*   Software Link: <https://www.campcodes.com/downloads/online-food-ordering-system-using-php-mysqli/?wpdmdl=5818&ind=0>\n*   The content includes a screenshot of sqlmap output demonstrating the vulnerability.",

The root cause is that the application does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements used in an SQL command.|\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary identified CWE is CWE-89. It's a base-level CWE, which is appropriate. There are no direct parent-child or chain relationships directly relevant in this specific case based on the provided information. The abstraction level is appropriate as it's a Base level CWE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    \n    class cwe89 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward:\n1.  Root Cause: **Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')** (CWE-89) due to the application's failure to sanitize user input.\n2.  Impact: Unauthorized database access, sensitive data leakage, data tampering, comprehensive system control, and even service interruption.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is clearly SQL injection, as the application directly uses unsanitized user input in SQL queries. The evidence for this is strong, as the vulnerability description states that the manipulation of the \"Name\" argument leads to **SQL injection**. The CVE reference confirms this, noting the root cause as the injection of malicious code from the 'name' parameter directly into SQL queries without proper cleaning or validation.\n\nThe \"Retriever Results\" also strongly suggest CWE-89 as the top candidate. The \"Complete CWE Specifications\" for CWE-89 aligns perfectly with the vulnerability description.\n\nCWE-79 was considered due to the presence of user-supplied data, but it is not applicable here because the data is not being used to generate a web page; it's being used directly in an SQL query. CWE-434 (Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type) is not relevant as there is no file upload involved.\n\nThe selection of CWE-89 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability which is the **improper neutralization of input in an SQL query**.",
