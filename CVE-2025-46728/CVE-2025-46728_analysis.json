  "description": "cpp-httplib is a C++ header-only HTTP/HTTPS server and client library. Prior to version 0.20.1, the library fails to enforce configured size limits on incoming request bodies when `Transfer-Encoding chunked` is used or when no `Content-Length` header is provided. A remote attacker can send a chunked request without the terminating zero-length chunk, causing **uncontrolled memory allocation** on the server. This leads to potential exhaustion of system memory and results in a server crash or unresponsiveness. Version 0.20.1 fixes the issue by enforcing limits during parsing. If the limit is exceeded at any point during reading, the connection is terminated immediately. A short-term workaround through a Reverse Proxy is available. If updating the library immediately is not feasible, deploy a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx, HAProxy) in front of the `cpp-httplib` application. Configure the proxy to enforce maximum request body size limits, thereby stopping excessively large requests before they reach the vulnerable library code.",

A remote attacker can send a chunked request without the terminating zero-length chunk, causing uncontrolled memory allocation on the server.\n\nImpact of exploitation:\n*   Denial of Service: The server process will consume excessive memory until it crashes or becomes unresponsive.\n*   Resource Exhaustion: On multi-tenant systems, this can impact other applications by consuming system resources.\n\nAttack vectors:\nA remote attacker can send a chunked request without the terminating zero-length chunk.\n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position:\nRemote attacker\n\nMitigation or fix:\n1.  Short-term workaround through a Reverse Proxy: Deploy a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx, HAProxy) in front of the `cpp-httplib` application. Configure the proxy to enforce maximum request body size limits, thereby stopping excessively large requests before they reach the vulnerable library code.\n2.  Code fix: Enforce limits during parsing. If the limit is exceeded at any point during reading, the connection should be terminated immediately (e.g., by returning an error or closing the stream).\n```",

CWE-770 describes the broader issue of allocating resources without limits, while CWE-789 specifically focuses on memory allocation with excessive size values. The vulnerability description directly mentions **uncontrolled memory allocation**, which aligns well with CWE-789.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe789[\"CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n\n    cwe789 -->|CHILDOF| cwe770\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe789 primary\n    class cwe770 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the server failing to enforce size limits on incoming request bodies, particularly when `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` is used. This leads to **uncontrolled memory allocation**, which can eventually result in resource exhaustion and a denial-of-service condition (server crash or unresponsiveness).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis strongly points to CWE-789 as the primary weakness due to the **uncontrolled memory allocation** issue. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary explicitly mentions the server's failure to limit the total accumulated size during chunked transfers. This directly aligns with the CWE-789 description, which focuses on allocating memory based on an untrusted, large size value without ensuring it's within expected limits. CWE-770 is a reasonable secondary candidate as it's a broader category that encompasses resource allocation without limits, but CWE-789 is more specific and accurately reflects the memory allocation aspect of this vulnerability.\n\nThe evidence clearly indicates that the **uncontrolled memory allocation** is the core issue: \"A remote attacker can send a chunked request without the terminating zero-length chunk, causing **uncontrolled memory allocation** on the server.\"\n\nThe relationships in the graph confirm that CWE-789 is a more specific type of CWE-770.\n\nCWE-789 is the optimal level of specificity because the vulnerability explicitly involves allocating memory with an excessive size value.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were
