# Analysis for CVE-2025-46728

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-789 | Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value | 1.0 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-770 | Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling | 0.8 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-789 (Variant), which is a child of CWE-770 (Base). CWE-770 describes the broader issue of allocating resources without limits, while CWE-789 specifically focuses on memory allocation with excessive size values. The vulnerability description directly mentions **uncontrolled memory allocation**, which aligns well with CWE-789.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the server failing to enforce size limits on incoming request bodies, particularly when `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` is used. This leads to **uncontrolled memory allocation**, which can eventually result in resource exhaustion and a denial-of-service condition (server crash or unresponsiveness).

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis strongly points to CWE-789 as the primary weakness due to the **uncontrolled memory allocation** issue. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary explicitly mentions the server's failure to limit the total accumulated size during chunked transfers. This directly aligns with the CWE-789 description, which focuses on allocating memory based on an untrusted, large size value without ensuring it's within expected limits. CWE-770 is a reasonable secondary candidate as it's a broader category that encompasses resource allocation without limits, but CWE-789 is more specific and accurately reflects the memory allocation aspect of this vulnerability.

The evidence clearly indicates that the **uncontrolled memory allocation** is the core issue: "A remote attacker can send a chunked request without the terminating zero-length chunk, causing **uncontrolled memory allocation** on the server."

The relationships in the graph confirm that CWE-789 is a more specific type of CWE-770.

CWE-789 is the optimal level of specificity because the vulnerability explicitly involves allocating memory with an excessive size value.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-617: Reachable Assertion
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product contains an assert() or similar statement that can be triggered by an attacker, which leads to an application exit or other behavior that is more severe than necessary.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-193: Off-by-one Error
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A product calculates or uses an incorrect maximum or minimum value that is 1 more, or 1 less, than the correct value.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-130: Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product parses a formatted message or structure, but it does not handle or incorrectly handles a length field that is inconsistent with the actual length of the associated data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
An algorithm in a product has an inefficient worst-case computational complexity that may be detrimental to system performance and can be triggered by an attacker, typically using crafted manipulations that ensure that the worst case is being reached.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-908: Use of Uninitialized Resource
**Abstraction Level**: Base

**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allocates a reusable resource or group of resources on behalf of an actor without imposing any restrictions on the size or number of resources that can be allocated, in violation of the intended security policy for that actor.

**Mapping Guidance**:
