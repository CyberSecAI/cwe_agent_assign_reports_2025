  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved scsi qedf Ensure the copied buf is NUL terminated Currently, we allocate a count-sized kernel buffer and copy count from userspace to that buffer. Later, we use kstrtouint on this buffer but we dont ensure that the string is terminated inside the buffer, this can lead to **OOB read** when using kstrtouint. Fix this issue by using memdup_user_nul instead of memdup_user.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n- The `qedf_dbg_debug_cmd_write` function in the `qedf_debugfs.c` file of the Linux kernel's `qedf` (QLogic FastLinQ Ethernet driver) module was using `memdup_user` to copy data from user space into a kernel buffer. This function does not guarantee null termination of the copied data. Subsequently, `kstrtouint` was used on this buffer, which could lead to an out-of-bounds read if the user-provided data was not null-terminated.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- **Out-of-bounds read:** The core vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read. When `kstrtouint` operates on a non-null-terminated string, it may read beyond the allocated buffer, leading to a kernel crash or other unpredictable behavior.\n- **Lack of null termination:** The use of `memdup_user` without subsequent null termination was the direct cause of the issue.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- **Kernel crash:** The primary impact is a kernel crash due to the out-of-bounds read. This can lead to a denial of service on the affected system.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- **Debugfs interaction:** An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by writing data to the `debug_cmd` debugfs file. This file is associated with the `qedf` driver.\n- **User-controlled input:** The attacker can control the input data being copied by `memdup_user` and subsequently used by `kstrtouint`.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- **Local access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system to be able to interact with the debugfs files and trigger the vulnerability.\n- **Ability to write to debugfs:** The attacker needs sufficient privileges to write to the `debug_cmd` file, which is usually only available to root or users with specific access permissions.\n\n**Mitigation:**\n- The fix involves replacing the `memdup_user` call with `memdup_user_nul`. This function allocates the buffer and copies the data and ensures the copied buffer is null terminated.\n\n**Summary of changes:**\n- The following change was made in `drivers/scsi/qedf/qedf_debugfs.c`:\n  ```diff\n  --- a/drivers/scsi/qedf/qedf_debugfs.c\n  +++ b/drivers/scsi/qedf/qedf_debugfs.c\n  @@ -170,7 +170,7 @@\n   \tif (!count || *ppos)\n  \t\treturn 0;\n  -\tkern_buf = memdup_user(buffer, count);\n  +\tkern_buf = memdup_user_nul(buffer, count);\n  \tif (IS_ERR(kern_buf))\n  \t\treturn PTR_ERR(kern_buf);\n  ```\n\nThis change ensures that the buffer copied from the user space is null-terminated, thereby preventing the out-of-bounds read vulnerability when passed to kstrtouint.",

While CWE-125 is the direct result, the root cause involves how the buffer size was handled, which, if incorrect, could lead to the out-of-bounds read. The hierarchical relationships didn't strongly influence the decision here, but the chain relationships helped understand the progression of the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe131[\"CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\"]\n    \n    cwe125 <--|CANFOLLOW| cwe131\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe125 primary\n    class cwe131 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a potential **incorrect calculation of buffer size** and the use of `memdup_user` which does not guarantee null termination. This leads to a missing null terminator, and consequently an **out-of-bounds read** when `kstrtouint` is used.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial analysis focused on the **OOB read** as the primary **weakness**, which aligns directly with CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read). The retriever results also strongly suggested CWE-125. However, the root cause described involves copying data from user space without ensuring null termination, which could stem from an incorrect calculation or handling of buffer size.\n\nThe evidence from \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" strongly supports this: \"The `qedf_dbg_debug_cmd_write` function in the `qedf_debugfs.c` file of the Linux kernel's `qedf` (QLogic FastLinQ Ethernet driver) module was using `memdup_user` to copy data from user space into a kernel buffer. This function does not guarantee null termination of the copied data. Subsequently, `kstrtouint` was used on this buffer, which could lead to an out-of-bounds read if the user-provided data was not null-terminated.\"\n\nTherefore, while CWE-125 is the direct manifestation of the vulnerability, the underlying issue might be related to how the buffer size was calculated or handled initially (CWE-131). The fix of replacing `memdup_user` with `memdup_user_nul` further hints that the lack of null termination and the potential miscalculation of buffer size is a contributing factor.\n\nCWE-125 is chosen as the primary because the vulnerability description highlights the **OOB read**, and the primary fix addresses this issue directly. The relationship analysis, particularly the CANFOLLOW relationship from CWE-131 to CWE-125 supports that CWE-131 could have contributed to the **OOB read**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 1.00\n**Source**: alternate_terms\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nCWE-120 was considered because it relates to buffer overflows, but the description does not explicitly state that a buffer overflow occurred, only an **OOB read**.
