Later, we use kstrtouint on this buffer but we dont ensure that the string is terminated inside the buffer, this can lead to OOB read when using kstrtouint. Fix this issue by using memdup_user_nul instead of memdup_user. Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-124 CWE-457 CWE-1284 CWE-170 CWE-805 CWE-158 CWE-190 CWE-787 CWE-125 CWE-786",
