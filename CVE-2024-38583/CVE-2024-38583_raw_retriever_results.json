  "query": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved nilfs2 fix use-after-free of timer for log writer thread Patch series nilfs2 fix log writer related issues. This bug fix series covers three nilfs2 log writer-related issues, including a timer use-after-free issue and potential deadlock issue on unmount, and a potential freeze issue in event synchronization found during their analysis. Details are described in each commit log. This patch (of 3) A use-after-free issue has been reported regarding the timer sc_timer on the nilfs_sc_info structure. The problem is that even though it is used to wake up a sleeping log writer thread, sc_timer is not shut down until the nilfs_sc_info structure is about to be freed, and is used regardless of the threads lifetime. Fix this issue by limiting the use of sc_timer only while the log writer thread is alive.",
