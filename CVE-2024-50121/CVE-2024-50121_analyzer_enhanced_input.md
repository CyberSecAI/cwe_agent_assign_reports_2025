## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved nfsd cancel nfsd_shrinker_work using sync mode in nfs4_state_shutdown_net In the normal case, when we excute `echo 0 > /proc/fs/nfsd/threads`, the function `nfs4_state_destroy_net` in `nfs4_state_shutdown_net` will release all resources related to the hashed `nfs4_client`. If the `nfsd_client_shrinker` is running concurrently, the `expire_client` function will first unhash this client and then destroy it. This can lead to the following warning. Additionally, numerous use-after-free errors may occur as well. nfsd_client_shrinker echo 0 > /proc/fs/nfsd/threads expire_client nfsd_shutdown_net unhash_client ... nfs4_state_shutdown_net /* wont wait shrinker exit */ /* cancel_work(&nn->nfsd_shrinker_work) * nfsd_file for this /* wont destroy unhashed client1 */ * client1 still alive nfs4_state_destroy_net */ nfsd_file_cache_shutdown /* trigger warning */ kmem_cache_destroy(nfsd_file_slab) kmem_cache_destroy(nfsd_file_mark_slab) /* release nfsd_file and mark */ __destroy_client ==================================================================== BUG nfsd_file (Not tainted) Objects remaining in nfsd_file on __kmem_cache_shutdown() -------------------------------------------------------------------- CPU 4 UID 0 PID 764 Comm sh Not tainted 6.12.0-rc3+ #1 dump_stack_lvl+0x53/0x70 slab_err+0xb0/0xf0 __kmem_cache_shutdown+0x15c/0x310 kmem_cache_destroy+0x66/0x160 nfsd_file_cache_shutdown+0xac/0x210 [nfsd] nfsd_destroy_serv+0x251/0x2a0 [nfsd] nfsd_svc+0x125/0x1e0 [nfsd] write_threads+0x16a/0x2a0 [nfsd] nfsctl_transaction_write+0x74/0xa0 [nfsd] vfs_write+0x1a5/0x6d0 ksys_write+0xc1/0x160 do_syscall_64+0x5f/0x170 entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x76/0x7e ==================================================================== BUG nfsd_file_mark (Tainted G B W ) Objects remaining nfsd_file_mark on __kmem_cache_shutdown() -------------------------------------------------------------------- dump_stack_lvl+0x53/0x70 slab_err+0xb0/0xf0 __kmem_cache_shutdown+0x15c/0x310 kmem_cache_destroy+0x66/0x160 nfsd_file_cache_shutdown+0xc8/0x210 [nfsd] nfsd_destroy_serv+0x251/0x2a0 [nfsd] nfsd_svc+0x125/0x1e0 [nfsd] write_threads+0x16a/0x2a0 [nfsd] nfsctl_transaction_write+0x74/0xa0 [nfsd] vfs_write+0x1a5/0x6d0 ksys_write+0xc1/0x160 do_syscall_64+0x5f/0x170 entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x76/0x7e To resolve this issue, cancel `nfsd_shrinker_work` using synchronous mode in nfs4_state_shutdown_net.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **The `nfsd_client_shrinker` can concurrently unhash and destroy an `nfs4_client` while `nfs4_state_shutdown_net` is releasing resources related to the hashed `nfs4_client`. This race condition leads to a use-after-free vulnerability and warnings due to objects remaining in `nfsd_file` and `nfsd_file_mark` on shutdown.**
- **weakness:** **Race condition between `nfsd_client_shrinker` and `nfs4_state_shutdown_net` during resource cleanup.**
- **impact:** Use-after-free errors and warnings due to inconsistent state of the `nfs4_client` and related resources during shutdown. The system can become unstable and crash.
- **vector:** The vulnerability can be triggered by writing to `/proc/fs/nfsd/threads` to initiate the shutdown process, while the `nfsd_client_shrinker` is also active.
- **attacker:** Local user with write access to `/proc/fs/nfsd/threads`
- **product:** Linux Kernel
- **version:** 6.12.0-rc3+
- **component:** nfsd

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's the analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability arises from a race condition between the `nfsd_client_shrinker` and the `nfs4_state_shutdown_net` functions during the shutdown of the NFS server. Specifically, when the command `echo 0 > /proc/fs/nfsd/threads` is executed, it triggers the `nfs4_state_destroy_net` function within `nfs4_state_shutdown_net` to release resources associated with hashed `nfs4_client` structures. Simultaneously, the `nfsd_client_shrinker` might be running, and its `expire_client` function could unhash and attempt to destroy the same client.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Race condition:**  A race exists between the `nfsd_client_shrinker` and `nfs4_state_shutdown_net` during resource cleanup.
*   **Use-after-free:** If the shrinker unhashes a client and the shutdown process doesn't wait for the shrinker to complete, a use-after-free can occur when the shutdown process attempts to destroy resources associated with the client that the shrinker has already started to free.
*   **Improper synchronization:** The original code used `cancel_work` which does not guarantee that the work item is completed before proceeding. This led to the shutdown process continuing before the shrinker had finished, causing the race condition and use-after-free scenarios.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Kernel Warning/Bug:** The primary impact is a kernel warning or BUG, which can indicate unstable system behavior.
*   **Use-after-free errors:** The race condition can result in use-after-free errors, potentially leading to system crashes or other unpredictable behavior.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Triggering NFS server shutdown:** The vulnerability is triggered by the shutdown of the NFS server, which can be done using the command `echo 0 > /proc/fs/nfsd/threads`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Root or administrative privileges:** The attacker needs the ability to write to `/proc/fs/nfsd/threads` which requires root or administrative privileges on the system.
*   **Access to the NFS server:** The attacker must have access to a machine that's running an NFS server.

**Technical details:**

The core of the issue lies in the non-synchronous nature of `cancel_work()`. When `cancel_work` is used, it only attempts to remove the work item from the queue. It does not wait for the work item (in this case, `nfsd_shrinker_work`) to finish processing before continuing. This allows `nfs4_state_shutdown_net` to proceed with the shutdown process and the destruction of resources related to the nfs4 client, potentially before the shrinker has finished with the same resource leading to a race condition and a use-after-free. The fix introduces `cancel_work_sync()`, which waits for the work item to complete before continuing, resolving the race condition and use-after-free issue.

The provided content also includes detailed stack traces from the kernel bugs, illustrating the specific functions that are being called when the issue occurs.

The fix, as shown in the diff, replaces `cancel_work` with `cancel_work_sync` in `nfs4_state_shutdown_net`. This ensures that the `nfsd_shrinker_work` is fully completed before the shutdown process continues, thus resolving the identified race condition and preventing use-after-free errors.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.

### Extended Description


A race condition occurs within concurrent environments, and it is effectively a property of a code sequence. Depending on the context, a code sequence may be in the form of a function call, a small number of instructions, a series of program invocations, etc.


A race condition violates these properties, which are closely related:


  - Exclusivity - the code sequence is given exclusive access to the shared resource, i.e., no other code sequence can modify properties of the shared resource before the original sequence has completed execution.

  - Atomicity - the code sequence is behaviorally atomic, i.e., no other thread or process can concurrently execute the same sequence of instructions (or a subset) against the same resource.

A race condition exists when an "interfering code sequence" can still access the shared resource, violating exclusivity.

The interfering code sequence could be "trusted" or "untrusted." A trusted interfering code sequence occurs within the product; it cannot be modified by the attacker, and it can only be invoked indirectly. An untrusted interfering code sequence can be authored directly by the attacker, and typically it is external to the vulnerable product.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**

### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** The relationship between race conditions and synchronization problems (CWE-662) needs to be further developed. They are not necessarily two perspectives of the same core concept, since synchronization is only one technique for avoiding race conditions, and synchronization can be used for other purposes besides race condition prevention.

**[Research Gap]** Race conditions in web applications are under-studied and probably under-reported. However, in 2008 there has been growing interest in this area.

**[Research Gap]** Much of the focus of race condition research has been in Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) variants (CWE-367), but many race conditions are related to synchronization problems that do not necessarily require a time-of-check.

**[Research Gap]** From a classification/taxonomy perspective, the relationships between concurrency and program state need closer investigation and may be useful in organizing related issues.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-29527:** Go application for cloud management creates a world-writable sudoers file that allows local attackers to inject sudo rules and escalate privileges to root by winning a race condition.

## CWE-416: Use After Free
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product reuses or references memory after it has been freed. At some point afterward, the memory may be allocated again and saved in another pointer, while the original pointer references a location somewhere within the new allocation. Any operations using the original pointer are no longer valid because the memory "belongs" to the code that operates on the new pointer.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Dangling pointer: a pointer that no longer points to valid memory, often after it has been freed

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-20141:** Chain: an operating system kernel has insufficent resource locking (CWE-413) leading to a use after free (CWE-416).
- **CVE-2022-2621:** Chain: two threads in a web browser use the same resource (CWE-366), but one of those threads can destroy the resource before the other has completed (CWE-416).
- **CVE-2021-0920:** Chain: mobile platform race condition (CWE-362) leading to use-after-free (CWE-416), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.




## CWE-667: Improper Locking
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.

### Extended Description


Locking is a type of synchronization behavior that ensures that multiple independently-operating processes or threads do not interfere with each other when accessing the same resource. All processes/threads are expected to follow the same steps for locking. If these steps are not followed precisely - or if no locking is done at all - then another process/thread could modify the shared resource in a way that is not visible or predictable to the original process. This can lead to data or memory corruption, denial of service, etc.

### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** Deeper research is necessary for synchronization and related mechanisms, including locks, mutexes, semaphores, and other mechanisms. Multiple entries are dependent on this research, which includes relationships to concurrency, race conditions, reentrant functions, etc. CWE-662 and its children - including CWE-667, CWE-820, CWE-821, and others - may need to be modified significantly, along with their relationships.

- **CVE-2009-0935:** Attacker provides invalid address to a memory-reading function, causing a mutex to be unlocked twice
- **CVE-2010-4210:** function in OS kernel unlocks a mutex that was not previously locked, causing a panic or overwrite of arbitrary memory.




## CWE-833: Deadlock
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

- **CVE-2009-1961:** OS deadlock involving 3 separate functions




## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check. This can cause the product to perform invalid actions when the resource is in an unexpected state.

### Extended Description
This weakness can be security-relevant when an attacker can influence the state of the resource between check and use. This can happen with shared resources such as files, memory, or even variables in multithreaded programs.

### Alternative Terms
TOCTTOU: The TOCTTOU acronym expands to "Time Of Check To Time Of Use".
TOCCTOU: The TOCCTOU acronym is most likely a typo of TOCTTOU, but it has been used in some influential documents, so the typo is repeated fairly frequently.

### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** TOCTOU issues do not always involve symlinks, and not every symlink issue is a TOCTOU problem.

**[Research Gap]** Non-symlink TOCTOU issues are not reported frequently, but they are likely to occur in code that attempts to be secure.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2015-1743:** TOCTOU in sandbox process allows installation of untrusted browser add-ons by replacing a file after it has been verified, but before it is executed
- **CVE-2003-0813:** A multi-threaded race condition allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash or reboot) by causing two threads to process the same RPC request, which causes one thread to use memory after it has been freed.
- **CVE-2004-0594:** PHP flaw allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by aborting execution before the initialization of key data structures is complete.




## CWE-401: Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not sufficiently track and release allocated memory after it has been used, which slowly consumes remaining memory.

### Extended Description
This is often triggered by improper handling of malformed data or unexpectedly interrupted sessions. In some languages, developers are responsible for tracking memory allocation and releasing the memory. If there are no more pointers or references to the memory, then it can no longer be tracked and identified for release.

### Alternative Terms

### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This is often a resultant weakness due to improper handling of malformed data or early termination of sessions.

**[Terminology]** "memory leak" has sometimes been used to describe other kinds of issues, e.g. for information leaks in which the contents of memory are inadvertently leaked (CVE-2003-0400 is one such example of this terminology conflict).



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2005-3119:** Memory leak because function does not free() an element of a data structure.
- **CVE-2004-0427:** Memory leak when counter variable is not decremented.
- **CVE-2002-0574:** chain: reference count is not decremented, leading to memory leak in OS by sending ICMP packets.




## CWE-364: Signal Handler Race Condition
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses a signal handler that introduces a race condition.

### Extended Description


Race conditions frequently occur in signal handlers, since signal handlers support asynchronous actions. These race conditions have a variety of root causes and symptoms. Attackers may be able to exploit a signal handler race condition to cause the product state to be corrupted, possibly leading to a denial of service or even code execution.


These issues occur when non-reentrant functions, or state-sensitive actions occur in the signal handler, where they may be called at any time. These behaviors can violate assumptions being made by the "regular" code that is interrupted, or by other signal handlers that may also be invoked. If these functions are called at an inopportune moment - such as while a non-reentrant function is already running - memory corruption could occur that may be exploitable for code execution. Another signal race condition commonly found occurs when free is called within a signal handler, resulting in a double free and therefore a write-what-where condition. Even if a given pointer is set to NULL after it has been freed, a race condition still exists between the time the memory was freed and the pointer was set to NULL. This is especially problematic if the same signal handler has been set for more than one signal -- since it means that the signal handler itself may be reentered.


There are several known behaviors related to signal handlers that have received the label of "signal handler race condition":


  - Shared state (e.g. global data or static variables) that are accessible to both a signal handler and "regular" code

  - Shared state between a signal handler and other signal handlers

  - Use of non-reentrant functionality within a signal handler - which generally implies that shared state is being used. For example, malloc() and free() are non-reentrant because they may use global or static data structures for managing memory, and they are indirectly used by innocent-seeming functions such as syslog(); these functions could be exploited for memory corruption and, possibly, code execution.

  - Association of the same signal handler function with multiple signals - which might imply shared state, since the same code and resources are accessed. For example, this can be a source of double-free and use-after-free weaknesses.

  - Use of setjmp and longjmp, or other mechanisms that prevent a signal handler from returning control back to the original functionality

  - While not technically a race condition, some signal handlers are designed to be called at most once, and being called more than once can introduce security problems, even when there are not any concurrent calls to the signal handler. This can be a source of double-free and use-after-free weaknesses.

Signal handler vulnerabilities are often classified based on the absence of a specific protection mechanism, although this style of classification is discouraged in CWE because programmers often have a choice of several different mechanisms for addressing the weakness. Such protection mechanisms may preserve exclusivity of access to the shared resource, and behavioral atomicity for the relevant code:

  - Avoiding shared state

  - Using synchronization in the signal handler

  - Using synchronization in the regular code

  - Disabling or masking other signals, which provides atomicity (which effectively ensures exclusivity)

- **CVE-2011-1027:** Chain: off-by-one error (CWE-193) leads to infinite loop (CWE-835) using invalid hex-encoded characters.




## CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product allocates a reusable resource or group of resources on behalf of an actor without imposing any restrictions on the size or number of resources that can be allocated, in violation of the intended security policy for that actor.

### Extended Description


Code frequently has to work with limited resources, so programmers must be careful to ensure that resources are not consumed too quickly, or too easily. Without use of quotas, resource limits, or other protection mechanisms, it can be easy for an attacker to consume many resources by rapidly making many requests, or causing larger resources to be used than is needed. When too many resources are allocated, or if a single resource is too large, then it can prevent the code from working correctly, possibly leading to a denial of service.

### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This entry is different from uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400) in that there are other weaknesses that are related to inability to control resource consumption, such as holding on to a resource too long after use, or not correctly keeping track of active resources so that they can be managed and released when they are finished (CWE-771).

**[Theoretical]** Vulnerability theory is largely about how behaviors and resources interact. "Resource exhaustion" can be regarded as either a consequence or an attack, depending on the perspective. This entry is an attempt to reflect one of the underlying weaknesses that enable these attacks (or consequences) to take place.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).
- **CVE-2009-4017:** Language interpreter does not restrict the number of temporary files being created when handling a MIME request with a large number of parts..
- **CVE-2009-2726:** Driver does not use a maximum width when invoking sscanf style functions, causing stack consumption.
