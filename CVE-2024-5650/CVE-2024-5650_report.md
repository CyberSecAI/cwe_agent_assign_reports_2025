# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-5650

## Description

**DLL Hijacking vulnerability** has been found in CENTUM CAMS Log server provided by Yokogawa Electric Corporation. If an attacker is somehow able to intrude into a computer that installed affected product or access to a shared folder, by replacing the DLL file with a tampered one, it is possible to execute arbitrary programs with the authority of the SYSTEM account. The affected products and versions are as follows CENTUM CS 3000 R3.08.10 to R3.09.50 CENTUM VP R4.01.00 to R4.03.00, R5.01.00 to R5.04.20, R6.01.00 to R6.11.10.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Rootcause:** DLL Hijacking vulnerability

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary

| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-427 | Uncontrolled Search Path Element | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE: The vulnerability is due to **DLL hijacking**, which occurs because the application **loads DLLs from an uncontrolled search path**. An attacker can place a malicious DLL in a directory that is searched before the legitimate DLL directory, leading to arbitrary code execution. |
| CWE-114 | Process Injection | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate: The **DLL Hijacking vulnerability** leads to the injection of malicious code into the process. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis

The primary CWE, CWE-427, is a base-level CWE that directly addresses the **uncontrolled search path** issue that leads to **DLL hijacking**. CWE-114 is related because DLL hijacking is a form of process injection.

## Vulnerability Chain

The vulnerability chain starts with the **uncontrolled search path** (CWE-427), which allows an attacker to inject a malicious DLL. This leads to the execution of arbitrary code within the context of the application (CWE-114).
  - CWE-427 (Root Cause): The application uses an **uncontrolled search path** when loading DLLs.
  - CWE-114 (Impact): An attacker places a malicious DLL in a searched directory allowing for **process injection** and **arbitrary code execution**.

## Summary of Analysis

The analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and CVE reference. The core issue is **DLL hijacking**, resulting from the application loading DLLs from an **uncontrolled search path**. This directly maps to CWE-427. The consequence of this **DLL hijacking** is the ability to inject code into the running process, which can be categorized as CWE-114.

The evidence clearly indicates that the **root cause** is the **uncontrolled search path**, enabling the attacker to replace a legitimate DLL with a malicious one. The description states, "If an attacker is somehow able to intrude into a computer that installed affected product or access to a shared folder, by replacing the DLL file with a tampered one, it is possible to execute arbitrary programs with the authority of the SYSTEM account."

The selection of CWE-427 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **root cause** of the **DLL hijacking** vulnerability.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-427: Uncontrolled Search Path Element
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a fixed or controlled search path to find resources, but one or more locations in that path can be under the control of unintended actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

### Alternative Considerations

*   CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials): While the attacker needs to craft a malicious DLL, the core issue isn't about credentials, but rather the **uncontrolled loading of DLLs**. Therefore, this CWE is not applicable.
*   CWE-287 (Improper Authentication): This is not related to authentication bypass.
*   CWE-732 (Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource): While permissions are involved in writing the malicious DLL, the core issue is the **uncontrolled search path**, not the permission assignment itself.
*   CWE-94 (Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')): This is a consequence of the DLL injection but not the root cause. The root cause is the **uncontrolled search path**.
*   CWE-114 (Process Injection): This is a potential consequence but not the root cause of the **DLL hijacking vulnerability**.
