# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-12085
## Query
A flaw was found in rsync which could be triggered when rsync compares file checksums. This flaw allows an attacker to manipulate the checksum length (s2length) to cause a comparison between a checksum and uninitialized memory and leak one byte of uninitialized stack data at a time.

## Keyphrases
- **weakness**: 'uninitialized memory access'
