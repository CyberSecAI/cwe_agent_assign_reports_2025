# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-12085

## Vulnerability Description
A flaw was found in rsync which could be triggered when rsync compares file checksums. This flaw allows an attacker to manipulate the checksum length (s2length) to cause a comparison between a checksum and uninitialized memory and leak one byte of uninitialized stack data at a time.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **uninitialized memory access**
- **impact:** manipulate the checksum length (s2length) to cause a comparison between a checksum and uninitialized memory and leak one byte of uninitialized stack data at a time
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** rsync
