  "description": "A vulnerability was found in Codezips Pet Shop Management System 1.0. It has been classified as critical. This affects an unknown part of the file /productsadd.php. The manipulation of the argument id/name leads to **sql injection**. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The initial researcher advisory mentions contradicting file names to be affected.",

  "reference_content": "The provided content is related to CVE-2024-10752.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the `productupdate.php` file of the 'Pet Shop Management System In PHP With Source Code'. The vulnerability exists because the application directly uses the \"id\" parameter in SQL queries without proper sanitization or validation.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\nThe primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The code fails to sanitize user input from the 'id' parameter before using it in SQL queries.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\nAn attacker can exploit this SQL injection to gain unauthorized access to the database, potentially leading to sensitive data leakage, data tampering, complete system control, and service interruption.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\nThe attack vector is through the `productupdate.php` file. An attacker can send malicious SQL code via the \"id\" parameter, which is used directly in database queries.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\nThe attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable `productupdate.php` file with a manipulated `id` parameter. No login or authorization is required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\nThe provided content also gives a detailed payload and proof of concept using sqlmap. The types of SQL injection vulnerabilities identified include:\n\n*   Boolean-based blind\n*   Error-based\n*   Time-based blind\n\nThe content also lists suggested remediations like using prepared statements, input validation, minimizing database user permissions, and regular security audits.",

This CWE represents the root cause of the vulnerability. The Retriever Results also gave **CWE-89** the highest score and it is listed as \"Allowed\" for usage.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe89 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL command** (**CWE-89**). The lack of proper input sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code, leading to unauthorized database access, data leakage, data tampering, system compromise, and service interruption.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis strongly supports the classification of this vulnerability as **CWE-89** Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection'). The vulnerability description clearly states that the **manipulation of the argument id/name leads to sql injection**, and the CVE reference confirms that the root cause is due to the application directly using the \"id\" parameter in SQL queries without proper sanitization or validation. This aligns perfectly with the definition of **CWE-89**.\n\nThe Retriever Results also listed **CWE-89** as the top candidate with a score of 1.0. The suggested mitigations in the CVE reference, such as using prepared statements and input validation, are also directly relevant to preventing **CWE-89**.\n\nThe decision to map this vulnerability to **CWE-89** is based on the clear evidence of SQL injection, the high confidence score from the Retriever Results, and the alignment of the suggested mitigations with the characteristics of **CWE-89**. Other CWEs like **CWE-79** (Cross-site Scripting) and **CWE-434** (Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type) were considered but ultimately deemed less relevant as the primary issue is the SQL injection vulnerability and not related to web page generation or file uploads.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n*   **CWE-89**: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n    *   The product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.\n    *   This aligns with the vulnerability where the \"id\" parameter is directly used in SQL queries without proper sanitization.",
