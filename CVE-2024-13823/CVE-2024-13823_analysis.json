There are no other relationships that significantly impact the selection, as the vulnerability is a straightforward case of reflected XSS. While other CWEs like CWE-80 and CWE-87 are related to XSS, CWE-79 is a more general and direct match for the **improper neutralization** of input before web page generation.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    \n    class cwe79 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is simple: User input is not sanitized, leading to reflected XSS.\n  - **Root Cause:** Improper Neutralization of Input (CWE-79)\n  - **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability exploitable on unauthenticated users.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on direct evidence from the vulnerability description and the provided CVE analysis.
