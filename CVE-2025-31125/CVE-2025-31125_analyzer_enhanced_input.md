## Vulnerability Description
Vite is a frontend tooling framework for javascript. Vite exposes content of non-allowed files using ?inline&import or ?raw?import. Only apps explicitly exposing the Vite dev server to the network (using --host or server.host config option) are affected. This vulnerability is fixed in 6.2.4, 6.1.3, 6.0.13, 5.4.16, and 4.5.11.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** exposes content of non-allowed files
- **product:** Vite

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-31125 related content

Here's an analysis of the provided content, focusing on information relevant to CVE-2025-31125, following the given guidelines:

**1. Verification:**

The content directly references CVE-2025-31125 and describes a vulnerability in Vite. The description aligns with a security issue related to bypassing the `server.fs.deny` feature, allowing access to arbitrary files.

**2. Extraction of Relevant Information:**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:**
    The vulnerability stems from insufficient checks when handling requests with `?inline&import` or `?raw?import` query parameters. These parameters, when combined with file requests, bypass the intended file access restrictions enforced by `server.fs.deny`.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   Bypass of file access controls (`server.fs.deny`).
    *   Improper input validation of query parameters.
    *   Exposure of arbitrary file content.
*   **Impact of exploitation:**
    An attacker can retrieve the contents of arbitrary files on the server, potentially leading to sensitive information disclosure. The impact is limited to applications explicitly exposing the Vite dev server to the network (using `--host` or `server.host` config option).
*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   Crafting URLs with specific query parameters (`?inline&import` or `?raw?import`) to request files.
    *   Example URL: `http://localhost:5173/@fs/C:/windows/win.ini?import&?inline=1.wasm?init`
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   Network access to the Vite dev server.
    *   Ability to craft and send malicious HTTP requests.
    *   No authentication or special privileges are required.
*   **Mitigation or fix:**
    The vulnerability is patched in versions:
    *   `>=6.2.4`
    *   `>=6.1.3, <6.2.0`
    *   `>=6.0.13, <6.1.0`
    *   `>=5.4.16, <6.0.0`
    *   `>=4.5.11, <5.0.0`
    The commit `5967313` includes a fix to the `transformMiddleware` function, adding checks for `urlRE`, `rawRE`, and `inlineRE` to prevent bypassing the file system access controls.

**3. Additional Details:**

*   The content provides more detail than the official CVE description (which is currently a placeholder). It includes specific examples of attack vectors, the root cause, and the mitigation steps.
*   The CVSS score is provided: 3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N, indicating a moderate severity.
*   The vulnerability was reported by @Iuhsssss.
*   The commit message indicates the fix is related to a check in the transform middleware (`#19761`).
