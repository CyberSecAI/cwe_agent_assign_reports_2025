# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-41798

## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability has been identified in SENTRON 7KM PAC3200 (All versions). Affected devices only provide a 4-digit PIN to protect from administrative access via Modbus TCP interface. Attackers with access to the Modbus TCP interface could easily bypass this protection by brute-force attacks or by sniffing the Modbus clear text communication.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **vector:** brute-force attacks or sniffing
- **attacker:** attackers
- **product:** SENTRON 7KM PAC3200
- **version:** All versions
- **component:** Modbus TCP interface

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The SENTRON PAC3200 devices use a 4-digit PIN for administrative access protection via the Modbus TCP interface, which is insufficient to prevent brute-force attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Weak authentication mechanism (4-digit PIN).
    - Modbus communication is in clear text, allowing sniffing of the PIN during transmission.
    - Vulnerability is categorized as CWE-287 (Improper Authentication).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers with access to the Modbus TCP interface can bypass the PIN protection, gaining full administrative access. This allows for unauthorized manipulation of the device which leads to high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Network access to the Modbus TCP interface.
    - Brute-force attacks on the PIN.
    - Monitoring of Modbus cleartext communication to obtain the PIN.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Network access to the device's Modbus TCP interface.
    - Ability to send Modbus commands.
    - Ability to intercept network traffic (for sniffing)
