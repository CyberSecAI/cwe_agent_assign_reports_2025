This issue affects version 1.6.2 and the main branch. The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to view sensitive prompt data by accessing specific URLs, leading to potential exposure of critical information.",

However, this is a consequence rather than the root cause. |\n| CWE-285 | Improper Authorization | 0.5 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary Candidate: The vulnerability indicates a flaw in authorization logic, allowing unauthorized access. It's less specific than CWE-639 but still relevant. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-639, which is a base-level CWE. CWE-200 and CWE-285 are higher-level class CWEs representing the impact and a general authorization issue, respectively. CWE-639 provides the most specific explanation of the **improper access control** because it's related to user-controlled keys (URLs).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe639 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe200\n    cwe285 -->|PARENT_OF| cwe639\n    cwe200 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe639 primary\n    class cwe285,cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper access control**, specifically an **Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key** (CWE-639), which leads to the **Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor** (CWE-200). The root cause is the ability to manipulate the URL (key) to access other users' data.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified **improper access control** as the root cause. The retriever results suggested CWE-285, CWE-639, CWE-497, and CWE-200. After reviewing the CWE specifications and guidance, CWE-639 was chosen as the primary CWE because it accurately describes the vulnerability where a user can access another user's prompt data by manipulating the URL (user-controlled key). CWE-200 is a secondary CWE that describes the impact of the vulnerability, and CWE-285 is a general authorization issue that's less specific.\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.6.3, an **improper access control** vulnerability exists where a user can access prompt data of another user... The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to view sensitive prompt data by accessing specific URLs, leading to potential exposure of critical information.\"\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-639 describes the root cause, while CWE-200 describes the impact. Higher-level CWEs like CWE-284 (**Improper Access Control**) are too general.\n\nCWEs considered but not used:\n\n*   CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** - Too general; CWE-639 is a more specific cause.\n*   CWE-497: **Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere** - Partially relevant, but CWE-200 is a better fit for the exposure of sensitive information.\n*   CWE-306: **Missing Authentication for Critical Function** - Not applicable, as the issue is with authorization after authentication, not the lack of authentication.\n*   CWE-863: **Incorrect Authorization** - Relevant, but CWE-639 is a more precise cause.\n*   CWE-1427: **Improper Neutralization of Input Used for LLM Prompting** - Not directly relevant, although there might be secondary issues related to prompt injection, the primary issue is access control.\n*   CWE-1272: **Sensitive Information Uncleared Before Debug/Power State Transition** - Not relevant to the vulnerability.",
