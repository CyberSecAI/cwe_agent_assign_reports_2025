  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved smb client fix UAF in decryption with multichannel After commit f7025d861694 (smb client allocate crypto only for primary server) and commit b0abcd65ec54 (smb client fix UAF in async decryption), the channels started reusing AEAD TFM from primary channel to perform synchronous decryption, but that cant done as there could be multiple cifsd threads (one per channel) simultaneously accessing it to perform decryption.
