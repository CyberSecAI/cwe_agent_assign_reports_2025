# Analysis Report for CVE-2024-7424

# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-7424

## Description

The Multiple Page Generator Plugin - MPG plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of and access to data due to a **missing capability check** on several functions in all versions up to, and including, 4.0.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to invoke those functions intended for admin use resulting in subscribers being able to upload csv files and view the contents of MPG projects.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Rootcause:** missing capability check
- **Impact:** unauthorized modification of and access to data
- **Attacker:** authenticated attackers with Subscriber-level access and above
- **Product:** Multiple Page Generator Plugin - MPG plugin for WordPress
- **Version:** all versions up to and including 4.0.1

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-862 | Missing Authorization | 1.0 | Class | Primary | Allowed-with-Review |
| CWE-434 | Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type | 0.7 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship identified is the hierarchical one, where CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) is a class-level CWE. While more specific base-level CWEs might exist, the provided information strongly supports the absence of authorization checks, making CWE-862 a relevant starting point. CWE-434 (Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type) is considered because the missing authorization allows for uploading CSV files, but it is a consequence of the missing authorization, not the root cause. The relationship between them is more of a 'CanFollow' nature, where the missing authorization can lead to unrestricted uploads. The abstraction levels influenced the selection by favoring the class-level CWE-862 initially due to the broad nature of the missing check, but acknowledging that it could potentially be refined to a more specific base-level CWE if more details were available.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **missing capability check** (CWE-862), which allows authenticated attackers with subscriber-level access to invoke functions intended for admin use. This leads to the ability to upload CSV files (CWE-434) and view the contents of MPG projects, resulting in unauthorized modification of and access to data.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment identified the **missing capability check** as the primary root cause. The evidence from the vulnerability description and the CVE reference link content summary confirms this. The analysis considered several other CWEs, including those related to incorrect authorization and CSRF, but these were deemed less relevant as they describe scenarios where authorization mechanisms are present but flawed, or where request verification is the issue, neither of which matches the described vulnerability. CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) accurately represents the core issue. The selection of CWE-862 is based on the direct evidence of a **missing capability check** and aligns with the CWE's description. The level of specificity is appropriate given the available information. If more granular details about the specific type of resource being accessed without authorization were available, a more specific child CWE of CWE-862 might be considered. CWE-434 is a consequence and not the primary cause.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
**Abstraction Level**: Compound
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.

## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72

## CWE-862: Missing Authorization
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
