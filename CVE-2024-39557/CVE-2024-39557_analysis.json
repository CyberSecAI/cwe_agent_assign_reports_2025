  "description": "An **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption** vulnerability in the Layer 2 Address Learning Daemon (l2ald) of Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a **memory leak**, eventually exhausting all system memory, leading to a system crash and Denial of Service (DoS). Certain MAC table updates cause a small amount of memory to leak. Once memory utilization reaches its limit, the issue will result in a system crash and restart.

This refined selection provides a more precise understanding of the vulnerability's root cause and its progression to system failure. I have high confidence in this assessment due to the clear description of the **uncontrolled resource consumption** leading to a **memory leak** and system crash, and the relationships between the selected CWEs.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n**CWE-401: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption** - The product does not properly control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource, thereby enabling an actor to influence the amount of resources consumed, eventually leading to the exhaustion of available resources.\n\n**CWE-772: Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime** - The product does not release a resource after its effective lifetime has ended, i.e., after the resource is no longer needed.",
