# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-39557

# Vulnerability Description

    An **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption** vulnerability in the Layer 2 Address Learning Daemon (l2ald) of Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a **memory leak**, eventually exhausting all system memory, leading to a system crash and Denial of Service (DoS). Certain MAC table updates cause a small amount of memory to leak. Once memory utilization reaches its limit, the issue will result in a system crash and restart. To identify the issue, execute the CLI command user@device> show platform application-info allocations app l2ald-agent EVL Object Allocation Statistics Node Application Context Name Live Allocs Fails Guids re0 l2ald-agent netjuniperrtnhL2Rtinfo 1069096 1069302 0 1069302 re0 l2ald-agent netjuniperrtnhNHOpaqueTlv 114 195 0 195 This issue affects Junos OS Evolved * All versions before 21.4R3-S8-EVO, * from 22.2-EVO before 22.2R3-S4-EVO, * from 22.3-EVO before 22.3R3-S3-EVO, * from 22.4-EVO before 22.4R3-EVO, * from 23.2-EVO before 23.2R2-EVO.
