# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-41926
## Query
Mattermost versions 9.9.x <= 9.9.0 and 9.5.x <= 9.5.6 fail to validate the source of sync messages and only allow the correct remote IDs, which allows a malicious remote to set arbitrary RemoteId values for synced users and therefore claim that a user was synced from another remote.

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: 'fail to validate the source of sync messages'
