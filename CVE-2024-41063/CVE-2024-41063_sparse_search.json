We need to make sure that hdev->{rx_work,cmd_work,tx_work} which are queued into hdev->workqueue and hdev->{power_on,error_reset} which are queued into hdev->req_workqueue are no longer running by the moment destroy_workqueue(hdev->workqueue) destroy_workqueue(hdev->req_workqueue) are called from hci_release_dev(). Call cancel_work_sync() on these work items from hci_unregister_dev() as soon as hdev->list is removed from hci_dev_list.",
