# Retrieval Query for CVE-2024-50253

# Vulnerability Description

    In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved bpf Check the validity of nr_words in bpf_iter_bits_new() Check the validity of nr_words in bpf_iter_bits_new(). Without this check, when multiplication **overflow** occurs for nr_bits (e.g., when nr_words = 0x0400-0001, nr_bits becomes 64), **stack corruption** may occur due to bpf_probe_read_kernel_common(..., nr_bytes = 0x2000-0008). Fix it by limiting the maximum value of nr_words to 511. The value is derived from the current implementation of BPF memory allocator. To ensure compatibility if the BPF memory allocators size limitation changes in the future, use the helper bpf_mem_alloc_check_size() to check whether nr_bytes is too larger. And return -E2BIG instead of -ENOMEM for oversized nr_bytes.

    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. 
    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.

    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'multiplication overflow in nr_bits'

Relevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:

### 1. CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound (Score: 617.67)

The product performs a calculation that can
         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic
         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than
         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is
         incremented to a value that is too large to st...

### 2. CWE-197: Numeric Truncation Error (Score: 606.90)

Truncation errors occur when a primitive is cast to a primitive of a smaller size and data is lost in the conversion....

### 3. CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input (Score: 604.59)

The product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties....

### 4. CWE-194: Unexpected Sign Extension (Score: 597.42)

The product performs an operation on a number that causes it to be sign extended when it is transformed into a larger data type. When the original number is negative, this can produce unexpected values that lead to resultant weaknesses....

### 5. CWE-682: Incorrect Calculation (Score: 568.04)

The product performs a calculation that generates incorrect or unintended results that are later used in security-critical decisions or resource management....
