# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-43694

## Description

In the goTenna Pro ATAK Plugin application, the encryption keys are stored along with a static IV on the device. This allows for complete decryption of keys stored on the device. This allows an attacker to decrypt all encrypted broadcast communications based on broadcast keys stored on the device.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Rootcause:** encryption keys stored along with a static IV
- **Impact:** complete decryption of keys stored on the device
- **Attacker:** attacker
- **Product:** goTenna Pro ATAK Plugin

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-321 | Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key | 0.9 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE. The encryption key is present on the device. |
| CWE-1204 | Generation of Weak Initialization Vector (IV) | 0.8 | Base | Allowed | The IV is static and thus predictable. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that influenced the decision was the direct identification of a **hard-coded cryptographic key** and the use of a **weak Initialization Vector (IV)**.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **insecure storage of encryption keys along with a static IV**. This leads to the complete decryption of keys stored on the device. The root cause is the **use of a hard-coded cryptographic key** alongside a **weak IV**, allowing attackers to decrypt encrypted broadcast communications.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **insecure storage of encryption keys with a static IV**. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" explicitly states that the root cause is the insecure storage of sensitive information, specifically encryption keys and a static Initialization Vector (IV) on the End User Device (EUD).

The **hard-coded cryptographic key** directly matches CWE-321, as the key is stored on the device without proper protection. The static IV directly matches CWE-1204, as the IV is not randomly generated, making it predictable and weak.

The chosen CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly address the **root cause** of the vulnerability: the presence of a **hard-coded cryptographic key** and a **weak IV**.

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-1204: Generation of Weak Initialization Vector (IV)
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a cryptographic primitive that uses an Initialization
			Vector (IV), but the product does not generate IVs that are
			sufficiently unpredictable or unique according to the expected
			cryptographic requirements for that primitive.
			

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-941: Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product creates a communication channel to initiate an outgoing request to an actor, but it does not correctly specify the intended destination for that actor.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The use of a hard-coded cryptographic key significantly increases the possibility that encrypted data may be recovered.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information

**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.67
