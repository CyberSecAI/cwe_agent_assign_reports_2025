  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-10360\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability stems from the `render` function within multiple `widget.php` files (specifically `includes/widgets/accordion/widget.php`, `includes/widgets/remote-template/widget.php`, `includes/widgets/advanced-tab/widget.php`, `includes/widgets/faq/widget.php`, and `includes/widgets/off-canvas/widget.php`) in the \"Move Addons for Elementor\" WordPress plugin. These functions were directly displaying content from Elementor templates without checking the post status (e.g., published, pending, private, draft).\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Sensitive Information Exposure:** The plugin was exposing content from Elementor templates even if those templates were in 'pending', 'private', or 'draft' states. This allowed unauthorized users to see content intended to be private.\n- **Insecure Direct Object Reference:** The plugin used the template ID to fetch and render content without proper authorization checks.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- Attackers with Contributor-level access or higher could access sensitive template data, including unpublished content, private content, or drafts. This could lead to information disclosure, where sensitive information that was not intended to be public becomes visible to unauthorized parties.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- The vulnerability is triggered when the affected widgets render Elementor templates.\n- An attacker would need to be authenticated with Contributor-level access or higher on the WordPress site.\n- The attacker would need to manipulate the plugin's widget settings to reference the template IDs of interest.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- The attacker needs to have an account on the target WordPress site with at least Contributor-level privileges or higher.\n- The attacker doesn't need any special tools or techniques beyond those provided by the WordPress admin panel.\n\n**Additional details:**\n- The vulnerability affects all versions of the Move Addons for Elementor plugin up to and including 1.3.5.\n- The vulnerability is patched in version 1.3.6 by adding a check to ensure the template is not in 'pending', 'private', or 'draft' status before displaying it. The fix involves adding the following logic\n```php\nif(!in_array(get_post_status($template_id), ['pending', 'private', 'draft'])) {\n    echo move_addons_get_elementor()->frontend->get_builder_content_for_display( $template_id );\n} else {\n    echo '<p>'.esc_html__('The post is not published yet. Make sure to publish it to view the content.', 'moveaddons').'</p>';\n}\n```\nThis check was implemented in all the affected widget files.",

CWE-200 is a Class-level CWE that encompasses the **sensitive information exposure** aspect of the vulnerability. CWE-862 is a Class-level CWE that is related to the **missing authorization** issue. The vulnerability description clearly states that the plugin exposes content from Elementor templates without checking the post status, indicating a **missing authorization** check which leads to **sensitive information exposure**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe425[\"CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\"]\n\n    cwe425 -->|CHILDOF| cwe862\n    cwe862 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe200\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe862 secondary\n    class cwe425 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authorization** check (CWE-862) within the `render` function of the widgets. This **missing authorization** allows unauthorized access to template data, resulting in the exposure of **sensitive information** (CWE-200). The chain can be represented as: CWE-862 -> CWE-200.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause and the resulting impact. The evidence provided clearly indicates a **sensitive information exposure** due to a **missing authorization** check. The analysis of the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, specifically the Root Cause of Vulnerability and Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present sections, supports the selection of CWE-200 and CWE-862.\n\nThe graph relationships helped to understand the connection between **missing authorization** and **sensitive information exposure**. CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) can precede CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor).\n\nCWE-200 is the optimal choice as the primary CWE because the core issue is that **sensitive information** is being exposed to unauthorized actors. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"sensitive private, pending, and draft template data\" being extracted.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1336: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a template engine to insert or process externally-influenced input, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements or syntax that can be interpreted as template expressions or other code directives when processed by the engine.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.67\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
