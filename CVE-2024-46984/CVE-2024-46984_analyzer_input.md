# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-46984

## Vulnerability Description
The reference validator is a tool to perform advanced validation of FHIR resources for TI applications and interoperability standards. The profile location routine in the referencevalidator commons package is vulnerable to `**XML External Entities**` attack due to **insecure defaults of the used Woodstox WstxInputFactory**. A malicious XML resource can lead to network requests issued by referencevalidator and thus to a `Server Side Request Forgery` attack. The vulnerability impacts applications which use referencevalidator to process XML resources from untrusted sources. The problem has been patched with the 2.5.1 version of the referencevalidator. Users are strongly recommended to update to this version or a more recent one. A pre-processing or manual analysis of input XML resources on existence of DTD definitions or external entities can mitigate the problem.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **insecure defaults of the used Woodstox WstxInputFactory**
- **weakness:** **XML External Entities**
- **impact:** network requests
- **vector:** malicious XML resource
- **product:** referencevalidator
- **version:** before 2.5.1
- **component:** profile location routine

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-46984:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The content directly references CVE-2024-46984 and describes an XXE vulnerability that can lead to SSRF, which aligns with the provided CVE ID.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from insecure default configurations in the Woodstox WstxInputFactory used by the `de.gematik.refv.commons:commons` library. Specifically, the XML parser was not configured to disallow external entities.
- This insecure configuration allows processing of XML resources containing external entities.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject external entities within XML documents processed by the application. This is due to the insecure default configuration of the XML parser.
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** By exploiting the XXE vulnerability, an attacker can force the server to make requests to internal or external resources, leading to SSRF.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

- **SSRF:** An attacker can cause the server to make network requests to arbitrary URLs, which can be used to:
   -  Access internal resources not intended to be exposed to the internet, such as cloud metadata (e.g., AWS metadata), database HTTP interfaces, internal REST interfaces, and files using `file://` URIs.
   -  Import untrusted data into the application, bypassing input validations.
-  **Information Disclosure:**  Attackers can potentially read sensitive data from internal services or the server itself, such as configuration details and authentication keys.
-  **Potential for Further Attacks:** Successful exploitation could open avenues for other types of attacks depending on the nature of the accessed resources.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector is through crafted malicious XML resources that are processed by the vulnerable application.
- The attacker injects a malicious XML payload containing external entity references when processing XML from an untrusted source.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs the ability to provide or influence XML data processed by the vulnerable application. This could involve:
   - Uploading XML files.
   - Submitting XML data through a web interface.
   - Manipulating XML data used by the application.
- No specific user privileges are required, making the vulnerability easily exploitable.
- The attack can be initiated remotely.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects applications that use the `de.gematik.refv.commons:commons` library to process XML resources from untrusted sources.
*   The issue is fixed in version `2.5.1` of the `app-referencevalidator`.
*   Workarounds include pre-processing or manually analyzing input XML resources for DTD definitions or external entities.

This information provides a detailed understanding of the vulnerability, its exploitation, and the potential impact based on the provided resources.
