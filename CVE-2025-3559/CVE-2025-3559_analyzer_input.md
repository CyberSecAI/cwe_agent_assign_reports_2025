## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-3559 Content

The provided content details a SQL injection vulnerability in the `uzy-ssm-mall v1.0.0` application. This relates to potential vulnerabilities that could be assigned a CVE, but there is no CVE description provided to verify against.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of proper input validation and sanitization of user-supplied data, specifically the `orderBy` parameter, before it's used in constructing SQL queries. The application directly concatenates the user-provided value into the SQL statement.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   SQL Injection
*   Insufficient Input Validation

**Impact of exploitation:**

Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to:

*   Gain unauthorized access to sensitive database information.
*   Modify or delete data within the database.
*   Potentially execute arbitrary code on the database server (depending on database permissions).

**Attack vectors:**

*   HTTP request manipulation: Specifically, crafting a malicious `orderBy` parameter in the `/mall/product/0/20` endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
*   No authentication is required as the vulnerability is accessible without login.
*   Basic understanding of SQL injection techniques.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   Implement proper input validation and sanitization of the `orderBy` parameter.
*   Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
*   Employ a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to detect and block malicious requests.

**POC:**

```

**Additional Details:**

The content provides more detail than a typical CVE description, including the specific vulnerable endpoint, the call stack (`ProductMapper`-->`ProductServiceImpl`-->`ForeProductListController`), and code snippets illustrating the vulnerability.
