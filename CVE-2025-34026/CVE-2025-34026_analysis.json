  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-34026 based on provided content\n\nThe provided content details multiple vulnerabilities discovered in Versa Concerto by ProjectDiscovery. The content directly relates to CVE-2025-34026 as it is explicitly mentioned in the disclosure timeline and linked to a security bulletin.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the relevant information extracted from the provided text:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nImproper handling of the `X-Real-Ip` header in the Spring Boot Actuator endpoints. The application relies on the presence of this header for access control.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Authentication bypass in Spring Boot Actuator endpoints.\n*   Vulnerability in Traefik version allowing header manipulation (specifically, dropping the `X-Real-Ip` header).\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nUnauthorized access to sensitive functionality via Actuator endpoints, potentially leading to information leak (e.g., heap dumps, logged session tokens).  Accessing logs via `/portalapi/actuator/traces` could directly disclose user session tokens, enabling admin login.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n1.  Exploiting a known vulnerability in Traefik (GHSA-62c8-mh53-4cqv) to drop the `X-Real-Ip` header.\n2.  Sending a request to the `/portalapi/actuator` endpoint with the `Connection: X-Real-Ip` header to instruct Traefik to drop the `X-Real-Ip` header.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   Ability to send HTTP requests to the Versa Concerto instance.\n*   Awareness of the Traefik vulnerability and how to exploit it.\n*   Knowledge of the Actuator endpoint path.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   **Block Semicolons in URL Paths:** Implement a rule to block any incoming requests that contain a semicolon (`;`) in the URL path.\n*   **Drop Requests with Specific Connection Headers:** Configure your reverse proxy or WAF to drop any requests where the `Connection` header contains the value `X-Real-Ip` (case insensitive).\n*   Versa released hot fixes for the reported issues (CVE-2025-34025, CVE-2025-34026, CVE-2025-34027) on March 7, 2025.\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n\nThe blog post provides a detailed explanation of the authentication bypass mechanism, including code snippets and the race condition involved in achieving remote code execution. It also details the discovery process and the interaction with the Traefik reverse proxy.  The post also provides Nuclei templates for detection.",

The product has an alternate path that does not require authentication. |\n| CWE-201 | Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The product leaks sensitive system information (heap dumps, trace logs). |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-288, which is at the Base level. CWE-288 is related to CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) as a peer. The secondary CWE, CWE-201, is at the Base level.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe288[\"CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n\n    cwe288 -- PEEROF --> cwe306\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe288 primary\n    class cwe201 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **authentication bypass** (CWE-288) due to improper handling of the `X-Real-Ip` header. This leads to unauthorized access to administrative endpoints and sensitive information such as heap dumps and trace logs, which can be classified as **insertion of sensitive information into sent data** (CWE-201).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified several potential CWEs. However, after a thorough review of the vulnerability description, CVE reference links content summary, and the provided CWE specifications, CWE-288 and CWE-201 were determined to be the most appropriate.\n\nThe primary weakness is the **authentication bypass** (CWE-288). The Versa Concerto SD-WAN orchestration platform has an **authentication bypass** in the Traefik reverse proxy configuration, which allows an attacker to access administrative endpoints. The CVE reference links content summary states, \"Improper handling of the `X-Real-Ip` header in the Spring Boot Actuator endpoints. The application relies on the presence of this header for access control.\" This confirms that the application has an alternate path or channel that does not require authentication.\n\nThe secondary weakness is the exposure of sensitive information (CWE-201). The vulnerability allows access to internal Actuator endpoints, which can be leveraged for access to heap dumps and trace logs. The CVE reference links content summary states, \"Unauthorized access to sensitive functionality via Actuator endpoints, potentially leading to information leak (e.g., heap dumps, logged session tokens). Accessing logs via `/portalapi/actuator/traces` could directly disclose user session tokens, enabling admin login.\" This confirms that sensitive information is being inserted into sent data.\n\nThe retriever results suggested CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization), CWE-287 (Improper Authentication), and CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function). While these CWEs are related to authentication and authorization issues, they are not as specific as CWE-288, which directly addresses the **authentication bypass** due to an alternate path or channel. CWE-287 is too general, and CWE-306 would be applicable if there was no authentication at all. CWE-863 could apply but the evidence is stronger that an alternate path exists, so CWE-288 is more precise.\n\nCWE-288 and CWE-201 are at the optimal level of specificity, as they accurately represent the root cause and the resulting impact of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
