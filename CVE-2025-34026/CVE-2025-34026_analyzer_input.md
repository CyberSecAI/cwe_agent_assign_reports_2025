# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-34026

## Vulnerability Description
The Versa Concerto SD-WAN orchestration platform is vulnerable to an **authentication bypass** in the Traefik reverse proxy configuration, allowing at attacker to access administrative endpoints. The internal Actuator endpoint can be leveraged for access to heap dumps and trace logs.This issue is known to affect Concerto from 12.1.2 through 12.2.0. Additional versions may be vulnerable.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-34026 based on provided content

The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities discovered in Versa Concerto by ProjectDiscovery. The content directly relates to CVE-2025-34026 as it is explicitly mentioned in the disclosure timeline and linked to a security bulletin.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information extracted from the provided text:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

Improper handling of the `X-Real-Ip` header in the Spring Boot Actuator endpoints. The application relies on the presence of this header for access control.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Authentication bypass in Spring Boot Actuator endpoints.
*   Vulnerability in Traefik version allowing header manipulation (specifically, dropping the `X-Real-Ip` header).

**Impact of exploitation:**

Unauthorized access to sensitive functionality via Actuator endpoints, potentially leading to information leak (e.g., heap dumps, logged session tokens).  Accessing logs via `/portalapi/actuator/traces` could directly disclose user session tokens, enabling admin login.

**Attack vectors:**

1.  Exploiting a known vulnerability in Traefik (GHSA-62c8-mh53-4cqv) to drop the `X-Real-Ip` header.
2.  Sending a request to the `/portalapi/actuator` endpoint with the `Connection: X-Real-Ip` header to instruct Traefik to drop the `X-Real-Ip` header.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   Ability to send HTTP requests to the Versa Concerto instance.
*   Awareness of the Traefik vulnerability and how to exploit it.
*   Knowledge of the Actuator endpoint path.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   **Block Semicolons in URL Paths:** Implement a rule to block any incoming requests that contain a semicolon (`;`) in the URL path.
*   **Drop Requests with Specific Connection Headers:** Configure your reverse proxy or WAF to drop any requests where the `Connection` header contains the value `X-Real-Ip` (case insensitive).
*   Versa released hot fixes for the reported issues (CVE-2025-34025, CVE-2025-34026, CVE-2025-34027) on March 7, 2025.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control

**Authentication**:
Determines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.

* Example phrases: "user must log in", "lack of login check", "bypasses login"
* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.

  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* – used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).

**Authorization**:
Determines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do. It decides access *after* identity is verified.

* Example phrases: "unauthorized access", "regular user can access admin panel", "role checks are missing"
* CWE relevance: use CWEs like 862, 863, 285 for authorization errors:

  * **CWE-862**: *Missing Authorization* – the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all.
  * **CWE-863**: *Incorrect Authorization* – the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).
  * **CWE-285**: *Improper Authorization* – general category for any flawed authorization logic or design.

**Access Control**:
A broader term that includes both authentication and authorization. Governs how resources are protected and who can access them under what conditions.

* CWE relevance:

  * **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* – top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear.
  * This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.

## Mapping Discussion – Common Misclassification Patterns

### 1. **CWE-306 vs CWE-862**:

* **306** is about lack of **authentication** (e.g., *no login required at all*).
* **862** is about lack of **authorization** *after* authentication (e.g., *admin check missing*).
* ✅ Example CWE-306: *“An unauthenticated attacker can invoke the password reset API.”*
* ✅ Example CWE-862: *“An authenticated user without admin privileges can delete any user account.”*

### 2. **CWE-285 vs CWE-284**:

* **285** is specific to authorization flaws – it's a better choice than 284 **if** the issue involves *improper or missing role checks*.
* **284** should be reserved for general access control issues when it’s unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.

---

## Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification

**Phrase like "unauthorized access" is not enough.**

* If you **cannot determine whether identity was checked**, assume it’s **authorization** and consider 862 or 863.
* If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** → CWE-306.
* If the **access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced**, but it's not due to missing checks, consider **CWE-284**.

---

## Good Mapping Examples

* ✅ **CWE-306**: “The endpoint `/admin/deleteUser` does not require any authentication.”
* ✅ **CWE-862**: “Any logged-in user can change any other user's email without being an admin.”
* ✅ **CWE-863**: “An admin check exists but incorrectly grants access to non-admin users.”
* ✅ **CWE-285**: “Application uses a static role check that fails when roles change dynamically.”
* ✅ **CWE-284**: “Inconsistent enforcement of access rules across services with unclear policy source.”

| Role check is present but flawed                           | CWE-863        |
| General or ambiguous authorization failure                 | CWE-285        |
