The retriever results showed several potential CWEs related to authorization and access control. The guidance suggests that CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) should be avoided if a more specific child CWE like 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate. Given the specific mention of **improper access control** leading to privilege elevation and that an \"authorized attacker\" is able to elevate privileges, CWE-863 is the most fitting because it indicates that an authorization check is present but flawed. The classification guidance directs us to authentication CWE-306 when there is no identity check, CWE-862, when there is no role/privilege check after login, and CWE-863, when the role check is present but flawed.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe863 -->|PEEROF| cwe285\n    cwe285 -->|PARENT_OF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe285,cwe284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper access control** (CWE-284 could be considered as a high level starting point), which leads to **incorrect authorization** (CWE-863) and ultimately results in an authorized attacker being able to elevate privileges.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment considered CWE-284 due to the phrase \"**improper access control**\" in the vulnerability description. However, the guidance suggests using a more specific CWE if possible. The presence of an \"authorized attacker\" implies that authentication is likely in place, but the authorization is flawed, leading to privilege elevation. Therefore, CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) is chosen as the primary CWE, as it accurately reflects the scenario where the authorization check is present but flawed, allowing an attacker to elevate privileges. The vulnerability description suggests that there is a flaw in the authorization mechanism that allows privilege escalation, making CWE-863 the most appropriate choice.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE Classification Guidance\n\nThe following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:\n\n### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance\n\n## ===Guidance===\n\n### Level Set \u2013 Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control\n\n**Authentication**:\nDetermines *who* the actor is (identity validation).
