  "query": "A Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability was discovered in the file upload feature of gradio-app/gradio version 0.39.1. The vulnerability is due to improper handling of form-data with a large filename in the file upload request. By sending a payload with an excessively large filename, the server becomes overwhelmed and unresponsive, leading to unavailability for legitimate users.",
