This vulnerability affects the function CoachController of the file src/main/java/com/liujian/gymxmjpa/controller/CoachController.java. The manipulation of the argument coachName leads to **sql injection**. The attack can be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.",

  "reference_content": "**CVE-2025-0404 - PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval**\n\nThe provided content is **RELEVANT** and details a SQL injection vulnerability. Here's an extraction of the information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe `count` method in `src/main/java/com/liujian/gymxmjpa/controller/CoachController.java` does not filter the `coachName` parameter.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\nSQL Injection\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\nThe vulnerability allows for blind SQL injection, potentially leading to data leakage or modification. The attacker can determine the database name (identified as \"gym\" in the provided examples).\n\n**Attack vectors:**\nThe vulnerability is exploitable via HTTP requests to the `/coach/count` endpoint, manipulating the `coachName` parameter with SQL injection payloads.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\nAn attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application.  The provided examples show successful exploitation without authentication, suggesting it may be publicly accessible.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\nThe content does not provide a specific fix, but implies that proper input validation and sanitization of the `coachName` parameter in the `count` method is required to prevent SQL injection.\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n*   The attacker demonstrates how to determine the length of the database name and then extract characters from it using `substr()`.\n*   The attacker provides example payloads used to exploit the vulnerability.\n*   The attacker was able to determine the database name is \"gym\".\n*   The attacker provides login credentials (admin/admin123) which may be a default or compromised account.",

The root cause is the **lack of input validation** on the `coachName` parameter, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL code.\n\nThe vulnerability description states that the manipulation of the `coachName` argument leads to **SQL injection**.

The summary also details how an attacker can exploit this vulnerability to determine the database name and extract characters from it.\n\nThe \"Retriever Results\" further support this analysis, with CWE-89 being the top-ranked CWE. The high similarity score (1.000) and the \"Allowed\" usage recommendation confirm that CWE-89 is the most appropriate mapping.\n\nThe selection of CWE-89 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability: the **improper neutralization** of special elements used in an SQL command.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.
