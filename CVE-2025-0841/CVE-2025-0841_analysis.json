  "description": "A vulnerability has been found in Aridius XYZ up to 20240927 on OpenCart and classified as critical. This vulnerability affects the function loadMore of the component News. The manipulation leads to **deserialization**. The attack can be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component.",

The vulnerability is a result of the `unserialize` function being used on data from an unauthenticated POST request, allowing for PHP Object Injection.\n- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:\n  - CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data\n  - CAPEC-586: Object Injection\n- Impact of exploitation:\n  - An attacker could potentially compromise a site. The example provided shows how an attacker could write arbitrary files or achieve Remote Code Execution.\n- Attack vectors: Unauthenticated POST request.\n- Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs to be able to send a crafted POST request to the vulnerable `loadMore` endpoint of the affected modules.\n- Mitigation or fix:\n  - Search for the presence of the `unserialize` function.\n  - Include the `allowed_classes` option to disable Object Injection: `$setting = unserialize(base64_decode($this->request->post['setting']), ['allowed_classes' => FALSE]);`\n  - Replace the use of serialization with `json_encode` and `json_decode`.\n```",
