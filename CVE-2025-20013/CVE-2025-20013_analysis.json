This suggests the vulnerability is best characterized as a standalone information exposure issue. Although CWE-200 is a Class-level CWE, the evidence is not specific enough to select a more granular Base or Variant level CWE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe200 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain appears to be a direct path from the root cause to the impact:\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** Exposure of sensitive information.\n2.  **Impact:** Information disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability based on the provided description and CVE summary. The primary indicator was the \"**Exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized actor**\" along with the potential to \"**enable information disclosure**.\" This strongly pointed to **CWE-200 - Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor**.\n\nThe Retriever Results also listed CWE-200 as a candidate, further supporting this selection. While **CWE-200** is a Class-level CWE and is generally discouraged, none of the suggested Base or Variant level CWEs provided a better fit given the available information.\n\nThe analysis is primarily based on the evidence provided in the vulnerability description and the CVE reference summary. The graph relationships did not significantly influence the final selection as **CWE-200** stands alone.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Why Not Used**: Although this CWE is more specific than CWE-200, the provided information does not confirm whether the information is \"system-level\" or not, so it is not a good fit.\n\n## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-200 is commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error. As of CWE 4.9, over 400 CWE entries can lead to a loss of confidentiality. Other options are often available. [REF-1287].\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.\n\n**Why Not Used**: This CWE is too broad and doesn't specifically address the sensitive information aspect of the vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Why Not Used**: This CWE is not relevant as there is no mention of pointers in the description.\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Why Not Used**: There's no indication that files or directories are involved in the information exposure.\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n**Why Not Used**: This CWE is too generic and does not accurately reflect the specific weakness.\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Why Not Used**: The description doesn't suggest any issues with authentication algorithms.\n\n## CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits or stores authentication credentials, but it uses an insecure method that is susceptible to unauthorized interception and/or retrieval.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n**Why Not Used**: There is no mention of credentials in the vulnerability description.\n\n## CWE-213: Exposure of Sensitive Information Due to Incompatible Policies\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product's intended functionality exposes information to certain actors in accordance with the developer's security policy, but this information is regarded as sensitive according to the intended security policies of other stakeholders such as the product's administrator, users, or others whose information is being processed.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Why Not Used**: While this relates to exposure of sensitive information, there is no information to suggest incompatible policies are involved.\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Why Not Used**: There's no mention of cleartext transmission.\n\n## CWE-173: Improper Handling of Alternate Encoding\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 597.68\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly handle when an input uses an alternate encoding that is valid for the control sphere to which the input is being sent.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Why Not Used**: This CWE is not relevant as there is no mention of alternate encoding in the description.\n\n## CWE-22: Improper Limitation of",
