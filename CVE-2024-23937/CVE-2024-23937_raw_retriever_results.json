  "query": "This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Silicon Labs Gecko OS. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the debug interface. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it as a format specifier. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the device.",
