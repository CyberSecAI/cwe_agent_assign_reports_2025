CWE-120 is a Base level CWE, while CWE-119 is a Class level. The vulnerability description mentions a **buffer overflow** due to manipulation of the RETR command handler, which strongly suggests a buffer copy operation without size checking. Therefore, CWE-120 is chosen over its parent CWE-119.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe120[\"CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    \n    cwe120 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe120 primary\n    class cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **buffer overflow** in the RETR command handler, triggered by a remote attacker. The **lack of size checking** during the buffer copy operation (CWE-120) leads to the overflow, potentially causing arbitrary code execution or a denial-of-service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on the primary **weakness**, which is a **buffer overflow**. The retriever results suggested CWE-119 and CWE-120. After reviewing the descriptions and relationships, CWE-120 was chosen as the primary CWE because the description explicitly mentions the **buffer overflow** occurs due to **lack of size checking** of the input. CWE-119 is a broader category, and CWE-120 provides a more precise classification. The evidence is relatively strong, given the explicit mention of **buffer overflow** in the vulnerability description, but is of medium strength since the root cause is not described beyond that.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer
