This vulnerability affects the function passwd_set of the file /usr/bin/routerd of the component HTTP Header Handler. The manipulation of the argument pwd leads to command injection. The attack can be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.",

  "reference_content": "Here's an analysis of the provided content regarding CVE-2025-5146:\n\nThe content from github.com describes a command injection vulnerability in Netcore routers and wireless APs. It contains detailed information, including affected products, vulnerability causes, proof of concept (POC), and a recommended solution, going far beyond the typical scope of a CVE description.\n\nHere's a breakdown:\n\n*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation in the `passwd_set` method within the `routerd` service. Specifically, the password field is directly passed to the `passwd_set_api` function without any sanitization or validation. This, in turn, allows for command injection. The `passwd_set_api` function uses `popen` to execute commands.\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n    *   Command injection: The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject arbitrary commands into the system through the password field.\n    *   Lack of input validation: The core weakness is the absence of proper input validation, particularly on the password field when calling `passwd_set_api`.\n*   **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation leads to arbitrary command execution on the vulnerable device. This could potentially lead to full system compromise, data theft, or denial of service.\n*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/ubus` endpoint of the router. The request includes a JSON payload that specifies the `routerd` service and the `passwd_set` method, with a malicious command injected into the `pwd` parameter. The attacker needs to know a valid session ID to exploit the vulnerability, which must be obtained after login.\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to:\n    *   Have network access to the vulnerable device.\n    *   Know the IP address of the device\n    *   Authenticate to the web interface of the router to obtain a session ID.\n    *   Craft a malicious HTTP POST request with a valid session ID and a command injection payload.\n*   **Mitigation or fix:**\n    *   The recommended solution is to apply the same validation logic used for the username (allowing only underscores, letters, and numbers) to the password field.",

There is a potential chain of weaknesses starting with the improper input validation and leading to command execution. The abstraction level was important, selecting the base CWE for greater specificity.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    cwe78 -- CANPRECEDE --> cwe119\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with a **lack of input validation** on the `pwd` parameter, which leads to **command injection** when the parameter is passed to the `passwd_set_api` function and ultimately results in arbitrary command execution on the system.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary assessment is based on the vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary, which clearly indicates a **command injection** vulnerability due to **insufficient input validation**. The report states that the `passwd_set` method passes the password field directly to `passwd_set_api` without sanitization, leading to the execution of arbitrary commands via `popen`.\n\nThe selection of CWE-78 is strongly supported by the evidence and the retriever results. CWE-78 is at the optimal level of specificity (Base) and accurately describes the vulnerability.
