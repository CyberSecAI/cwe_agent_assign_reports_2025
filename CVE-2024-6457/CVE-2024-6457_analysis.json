  "description": "The HUSKY - Products Filter Professional for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to **time-based SQL Injection** via the woof_author parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.6 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-6457\n\n**Vulnerable Software:** HUSKY - Products Filter Professional for WooCommerce WordPress plugin, versions 1.3.6 and below.\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization and preparation of the `woof_author` parameter within an SQL query. The plugin uses user-supplied data from this parameter directly in a SQL query, without proper escaping.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n- **Time-Based SQL Injection:** The lack of proper sanitization allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code, including time-based delays, into the query, which can be used to extract sensitive data.\n- **Improper Neutralization of Special Elements:** User input is not properly sanitized before being used in an SQL query.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Sensitive Data Exposure:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to extract sensitive information from the WordPress database.\n- **Full Compromise:** Depending on the database user privileges, the attacker could potentially gain full access to the database.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is triggered via the `woof_author` parameter in an HTTP request.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to be logged into the WordPress site.\n- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target WordPress site.\n\n**Technical Details:**\n- The vulnerability exists in the `woof_post_author_filter` function within the `ext/by_author/index.php` file of the plugin.\n- Specifically, the code at line 99 of `ext/by_author/index.php` before the patch was vulnerable:\n    ```php\n    $where .= \"post_author={$request['woof_author'][$i]}\";\n    ```\n- The fix implemented in changeset 3116888, as seen on line 99, uses `$wpdb->prepare` to safely add the author to the query:\n    ```php\n    $where .= $wpdb->prepare(\"post_author=%d\", $request['woof_author'][$i]);\n    ```\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n- The Wordfence article provides a good description of the vulnerability.\n- The Trac links provide context to the vulnerable code and the commit where the fix was implemented.\n- The vulnerability is considered critical with a CVSS score of 9.8.\n\n**Remediation:**\n- Update the HUSKY - Products Filter Professional for WooCommerce plugin to version 1.3.6.1 or higher.",

The root cause is the **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship that influenced the decision was the parent-child relationship between CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')) and CWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')). CWE-89 is a more specific child of CWE-74, and because the vulnerability is specifically an SQL Injection, CWE-89 was selected.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    \n    cwe89 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe89 primary\n    class cwe74 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query** (CWE-89). This allows an attacker to inject SQL code, leading to the extraction of sensitive information from the database (information disclosure).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is primarily based on the provided evidence, which clearly indicates an SQL injection vulnerability. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions **insufficient escaping** and **lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**, which are key characteristics of CWE-89. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary further confirms this by stating that the root cause is the **insufficient sanitization** and preparation of the `woof_author` parameter. The provided code snippets also support this conclusion, as they show the use of user-supplied data directly in an SQL query without proper escaping.\n\nThe selection of CWE-89 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability.
