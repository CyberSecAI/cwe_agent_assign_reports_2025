It provides details beyond the placeholder description.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue stemming from the upload of a profile picture in SVG format containing malicious Javascript code.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **CVE-2025-3189:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)\n*   Improper input validation/sanitization of SVG profile picture uploads.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nThe impact is categorized as medium severity. While the specific impact isn't detailed beyond being an XSS, successful exploitation could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the application, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other client-side attacks. The CVSS score (4.8) and vector (CVSS AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:H/UI:P/VC:N/VI:N/VA:N/SC:L/SI:L/SA:N) indicate a network-based attack with low complexity, requiring user interaction, and having low scope/impact.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Uploading a crafted SVG profile picture containing malicious Javascript code.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   The attacker needs to have the ability to upload a profile picture (authenticated user with appropriate permissions - PR:H in the CVSS vector).\n*   Knowledge of XSS techniques and SVG format.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   Upgrade to DoWISP version 1.16.2.50 or later, which includes the fix for this vulnerability.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n*   **CWE:** CWE-78 (Cross-Site Scripting)\n*   **CVSS v4.0:** 4.8\n*   **Affected Software:** DoWISP versions prior to 1.16.2.50.\n*   The vulnerability was discovered by David Padilla Alvarado and coordinated through INCIBE.",

The vulnerability is a stored XSS issue. |\n| CWE-434 | Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary. The attack vector involves uploading a file of a dangerous type (SVG with embedded JavaScript). |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary weakness is CWE-79, which describes the core XSS vulnerability. CWE-434 is related because the attack vector involves uploading a dangerous file type, an SVG containing malicious JavaScript. While CWE-434 can precede CWE-79 in some scenarios, in this case, the improper neutralization (CWE-79) is the direct cause of the vulnerability being exploitable. The relationship is that the dangerous file upload provides the means for the XSS to occur, but the application's failure to neutralize the input is the fundamental flaw.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe434[\"CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\"]\n    \n    cwe434 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe79\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe79 primary\n    class cwe434 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the attacker uploading a malicious SVG file (CWE-434). The application then fails to properly neutralize the input from this file, leading to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (CWE-79).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary vulnerability is Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to the application's failure to neutralize input. The provided information explicitly states this: \"The vulnerability is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue stemming from the upload of a profile picture in SVG format containing malicious Javascript code.\" The retriever results also strongly suggest CWE-79 as the primary candidate.\n\nCWE-434 is a secondary factor, as it describes the attack vector (uploading a dangerous file). While important, it's the *lack* of neutralization that allows the XSS to occur. \"Improper input validation/sanitization of SVG profile picture uploads\" supports this.\n\nThe selection of CWE-79 as the primary weakness is based on the vulnerability description explicitly stating a stored XSS issue, supported by the retriever results, and aligning with the CWE's definition. CWE-434 is included as a secondary weakness as it is the method to inject the malicious code.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
