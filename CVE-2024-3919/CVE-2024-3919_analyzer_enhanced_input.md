- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The OpenPGP Form Encryption plugin does not properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into a page/post through the plugin's shortcode, which will be executed when a user views the page, potentially leading to actions such as session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites or information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting a malicious shortcode with a vulnerable attribute such as the `style` attribute within the `cryptbutton` shortcode. This shortcode can be embedded within a page or post.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have at least contributor-level access to be able to create and embed this malicious shortcode.

The provided content also includes a proof of concept (PoC) demonstrating how to exploit this vulnerability using a crafted shortcode.
