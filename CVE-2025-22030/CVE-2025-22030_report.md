# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2025-22030

## Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved mm zswap fix crypto_free_acomp() **deadlock** in zswap_cpu_comp_dead() Currently, zswap_cpu_comp_dead() calls crypto_free_acomp() while holding the per-CPU acomp_ctx mutex. crypto_free_acomp() then holds scomp_lock (through crypto_exit_scomp_ops_async()). On the other hand, crypto_alloc_acomp_node() holds the scomp_lock (through crypto_scomp_init_tfm()), and then allocates memory. If the allocation results in reclaim, we may attempt to hold the per-CPU acomp_ctx mutex. The above dependencies can cause an ABBA **deadlock**. For example in the following scenario (1) Task A running on CPU #1 crypto_alloc_acomp_node() Holds scomp_lock Enters reclaim Reads per_cpu_ptr(pool->acomp_ctx, 1) (2) Task A is descheduled (3) CPU #1 goes offline zswap_cpu_comp_dead(CPU #1) Holds per_cpu_ptr(pool->acomp_ctx, 1)) Calls crypto_free_acomp() Waits for scomp_lock (4) Task A running on CPU #2 Waits for per_cpu_ptr(pool->acomp_ctx, 1) // Read on CPU #1 DEADLOCK Since there is no requirement to call crypto_free_acomp() with the per-CPU acomp_ctx mutex held in zswap_cpu_comp_dead(), move it after the mutex is unlocked. Also move the acomp_request_free() and kfree() calls for consistency and to avoid any potential sublte locking dependencies in the future. With this, only setting acomp_ctx fields to NULL occurs with the mutex held. This is similar to how zswap_cpu_comp_prepare() only initializes acomp_ctx fields with the mutex held, after performing all allocations before holding the mutex. Opportunistically, move the NULL check on acomp_ctx so that it takes place before the mutex dereference.

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-833 | Deadlock | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-667 | Improper Locking | 0.7 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary Candidate |
| CWE-362 | Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') | 0.5 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is **CWE-833: Deadlock**. This is a base-level CWE, which is the preferred level of abstraction. **CWE-667: Improper Locking** and **CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')** are class-level CWEs that are related to concurrency issues. **CWE-667** is a parent of **CWE-833**, but **CWE-833** is more specific to the vulnerability description.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain is as follows:
1.  **Improper Lock Ordering (Root Cause):** The code acquires locks in an inconsistent order, leading to a **lock ordering dependency**.
2.  **CWE-833: Deadlock (Weakness):** The inconsistent lock ordering can result in a **deadlock** condition where two or more threads are blocked indefinitely, waiting for each other to release the locks.

## Summary of Analysis
The vulnerability is a **deadlock** caused by a **lock ordering dependency** in the Linux kernel's zswap functionality. The code acquires locks in an inconsistent order, leading to a potential **deadlock** scenario. The provided information clearly indicates a **deadlock** situation, making **CWE-833: Deadlock** the most appropriate primary CWE.

The vulnerability description explicitly mentions the term "**deadlock**" and describes a scenario where tasks are blocked indefinitely, waiting for each other to release locks. The fix involves reordering the lock acquisition to avoid the **deadlock** condition.

**CWE-833: Deadlock** is the most specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability based on the available evidence.

Other CWEs Considered:
*   **CWE-667: Improper Locking**: This is a more general class of weakness that could apply to the vulnerability, but **CWE-833** is more specific.
*   **CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')**: This is another class-level CWE related to concurrency issues, but **CWE-833** is a more precise description of the vulnerability.
*   **CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer**, **CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')**, **CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read**: These are not relevant to the described vulnerability.
*   **CWE-835: Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')**: Not relevant, as this involves a loop and not a deadlock.
*   **CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption**: Not relevant, as this involves consumption of resources but no mention of deadlock.
*   **CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity**: Not relevant, as there is no mention of algorithm complexity.
