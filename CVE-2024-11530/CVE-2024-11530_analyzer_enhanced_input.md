## Vulnerability Description
IrfanView CGM File Parsing Memory Corruption Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of IrfanView. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of CGM files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a **memory corruption** condition. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-24605.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing CGM (Computer Graphics Metafile) files, leading to a memory corruption condition.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory corruption due to insufficient input validation during CGM file parsing.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can achieve remote code execution, enabling them to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation requires user interaction. A victim must open a malicious CGM file or visit a malicious web page hosting such a file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to provide a crafted CGM file to the user, either through direct file access or by hosting it on a malicious website. The user is required to open the file or visit the malicious page.
