  "description": "IrfanView CGM File Parsing Memory Corruption Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of IrfanView. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of CGM files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a **memory corruption** condition. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-24605.",

A victim must open a malicious CGM file or visit a malicious web page hosting such a file.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to provide a crafted CGM file to the user, either through direct file access or by hosting it on a malicious website. The user is required to open the file or visit the malicious page.",

While the vulnerability description mentions a lack of proper validation, the resulting **memory corruption** points towards an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787) due to the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**. Thus, CWE-787 is the root cause with CWE-20 being a broader, less specific cause.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILD_OF| cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    cwe119 -->|CHILD_OF| cwe20\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe20 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper input validation** (CWE-20), which leads to an **out-of-bounds write** (CWE-787), ultimately resulting in **memory corruption** and **remote code execution**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe primary CWE is CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions **memory corruption** stemming from a **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**. This aligns with the description of CWE-787, where data is written outside the intended buffer, leading to memory corruption. The \"CWE for similar CVE Descriptions\" section also lists CWE-787 as the \"Primary CWE Match\" and the \"Top CWE\".\n\nCWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) is considered as a secondary CWE because the root cause is a **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**. However, it's a high-level class CWE, and the evidence points more directly to the consequences of the **lack of validation** which is **memory corruption**, which is best described by CWE-787.\n\nI considered other CWEs from the Retriever Results, such as CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read), CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow), and CWE-131 (Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size). However, these are less directly supported by the provided information. The description highlights a **memory corruption** condition without specifying the read/write operation or heap/stack allocation.\n\nThe final selection of CWE-787 and CWE-20 offers the most accurate and well-supported representation of the vulnerability, balancing specificity and completeness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-129: Improper Validation of Array Index\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses untrusted input when calculating or using an array index, but the product does not validate or incorrectly validates the index to ensure the index references a valid position within the array.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary.
