## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
```
- Root cause of vulnerability: A SQL injection vulnerability exists in the '/admin/user_save.php' file due to insufficient user input validation of the 'name' parameter. Attackers can inject malicious SQL queries because the input is used directly in SQL queries without proper sanitization or validation.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: SQL injection
- Impact of exploitation: Unauthorized database access, sensitive data leakage, data tampering, comprehensive system control, and service interruption.
- Attack vectors: Exploitation occurs through the 'name' parameter via a POST request.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to send a crafted POST request to the vulnerable URL.  No login or authorization is required.
- Mitigation or fix:
  - Use prepared statements and parameter binding.
  - Input validation and filtering to ensure data conforms to the expected format.
  - Minimize database user permissions.
  - Regular security audits.
