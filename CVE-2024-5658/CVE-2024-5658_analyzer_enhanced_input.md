## Vulnerability Description
The CraftCMS plugin Two-Factor Authentication through 3.3.3 allows **reuse of TOTP tokens multiple times** within the validity period.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **reuse of TOTP tokens multiple times**
- **product:** CraftCMS plugin Two-Factor Authentication
- **version:** through 3.3.3

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-5658:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper implementation of Time-based One-Time Passwords (TOTP) in the CraftCMS Two-Factor Authentication plugin. The plugin fails to enforce the single-use requirement of TOTP tokens.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Authentication:** The core issue is that the plugin allows the reuse of TOTP tokens within their validity period. This violates the fundamental principle of one-time passwords, as specified in RFC 6238 and the OWASP ASVS.
- **Lack of Token Invalidation:** The plugin does not invalidate a TOTP token after its first successful use.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker who obtains a valid TOTP token, along with the victim's credentials, can establish an authenticated session.
- **Circumvention of 2FA:** The vulnerability effectively bypasses the intended security benefit of two-factor authentication.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** An attacker could intercept a TOTP token in transit or obtain it through other means (e.g., social engineering, malware)
- **Authentication Endpoint:** The attacker sends an authentication request to the vulnerable endpoint with a valid but already used TOTP

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **User Credentials:** The attacker must possess the username and password of the targeted user.
- **TOTP Token:** The attacker must obtain a valid TOTP token for the targeted user.
- **Timing:**  The attacker needs to use the stolen TOTP token within its validity window.

**Additional Details:**
- **Affected Versions:** The vulnerability affects the CraftCMS Two-Factor Authentication plugin versions 3.3.3 and earlier.
- **Fixed Version:** The vulnerability is fixed in version 3.3.4 of the plugin.
- **Mitigation:** The recommended fix involves implementing a blocklist or similar mechanism to invalidate used TOTP tokens.
- **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 4.8 (Medium), with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N. This indicates a network-based attack with high impact on integrity.
- **Proof of Concept:** The provided proof of concept demonstrates that the same TOTP can be used in multiple sessions to gain unauthorized access.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control

**Authentication**:
Determines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.

* Example phrases: "user must log in", "lack of login check", "bypasses login"
* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.

  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* – used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).

**Authorization**:
Determines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do. It decides access *after* identity is verified.

* Example phrases: "unauthorized access", "regular user can access admin panel", "role checks are missing"
* CWE relevance: use CWEs like 862, 863, 285 for authorization errors:

  * **CWE-862**: *Missing Authorization* – the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all.
  * **CWE-863**: *Incorrect Authorization* – the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).
  * **CWE-285**: *Improper Authorization* – general category for any flawed authorization logic or design.

**Access Control**:
A broader term that includes both authentication and authorization. Governs how resources are protected and who can access them under what conditions.

* CWE relevance:

  * **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* – top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear.
  * This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.

## Mapping Discussion – Common Misclassification Patterns

### 1. **CWE-306 vs CWE-862**:

* **306** is about lack of **authentication** (e.g., *no login required at all*).
* **862** is about lack of **authorization** *after* authentication (e.g., *admin check missing*).
* ✅ Example CWE-306: *“An unauthenticated attacker can invoke the password reset API.”*
* ✅ Example CWE-862: *“An authenticated user without admin privileges can delete any user account.”*

### 2. **CWE-285 vs CWE-284**:

* **285** is specific to authorization flaws – it's a better choice than 284 **if** the issue involves *improper or missing role checks*.
* **284** should be reserved for general access control issues when it’s unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.

---

## Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification

**Phrase like "unauthorized access" is not enough.**

* If you **cannot determine whether identity was checked**, assume it’s **authorization** and consider 862 or 863.
* If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** → CWE-306.
* If the **access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced**, but it's not due to missing checks, consider **CWE-284**.

---

## Good Mapping Examples

* ✅ **CWE-306**: “The endpoint `/admin/deleteUser` does not require any authentication.”
* ✅ **CWE-862**: “Any logged-in user can change any other user's email without being an admin.”
* ✅ **CWE-863**: “An admin check exists but incorrectly grants access to non-admin users.”
* ✅ **CWE-285**: “Application uses a static role check that fails when roles change dynamically.”
* ✅ **CWE-284**: “Inconsistent enforcement of access rules across services with unclear policy source.”
