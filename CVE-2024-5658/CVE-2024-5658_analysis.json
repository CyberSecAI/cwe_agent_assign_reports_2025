  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-5658:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability stems from the improper implementation of Time-based One-Time Passwords (TOTP) in the CraftCMS Two-Factor Authentication plugin. The plugin fails to enforce the single-use requirement of TOTP tokens.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Improper Authentication:** The core issue is that the plugin allows the reuse of TOTP tokens within their validity period. This violates the fundamental principle of one-time passwords, as specified in RFC 6238 and the OWASP ASVS.\n- **Lack of Token Invalidation:** The plugin does not invalidate a TOTP token after its first successful use.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker who obtains a valid TOTP token, along with the victim's credentials, can establish an authenticated session.\n- **Circumvention of 2FA:** The vulnerability effectively bypasses the intended security benefit of two-factor authentication.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Network-based:** An attacker could intercept a TOTP token in transit or obtain it through other means (e.g., social engineering, malware)\n- **Authentication Endpoint:** The attacker sends an authentication request to the vulnerable endpoint with a valid but already used TOTP\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **User Credentials:** The attacker must possess the username and password of the targeted user.\n- **TOTP Token:** The attacker must obtain a valid TOTP token for the targeted user.\n- **Timing:**  The attacker needs to use the stolen TOTP token within its validity window.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n- **Affected Versions:** The vulnerability affects the CraftCMS Two-Factor Authentication plugin versions 3.3.3 and earlier.\n- **Fixed Version:** The vulnerability is fixed in version 3.3.4 of the plugin.\n- **Mitigation:** The recommended fix involves implementing a blocklist or similar mechanism to invalidate used TOTP tokens.\n- **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 4.8 (Medium), with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N. This indicates a network-based attack with high impact on integrity.\n- **Proof of Concept:** The provided proof of concept demonstrates that the same TOTP can be used in multiple sessions to gain unauthorized access.\n\nThe provided information gives a comprehensive view of the vulnerability, exceeding the standard CVE description placeholder.",

CWE-306 is a child of CWE-287, indicating a more specific scenario where authentication is completely missing. In this case, authentication is present but improperly implemented, making CWE-287 the more suitable choice. Additionally, CWE-307 relates to the improper restriction of excessive authentication attempts, which could be a contributing factor if there were no measures to prevent token reuse.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe307[\"CWE-307: Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts\"]\n\n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe307 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe287 primary\n    class cwe306,cwe307 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **improper authentication** mechanism (CWE-287), specifically the **reuse of TOTP tokens multiple times**. This leads to the possibility of unauthorized access, effectively bypassing the two-factor authentication. The absence of token invalidation is a critical factor in this chain.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, including the vulnerability description and CVE reference summary. The key phrase \"**reuse of TOTP tokens multiple times**\" directly points to a weakness in the authentication process. The CVE reference summary confirms this, stating, \"The core issue is that the plugin allows the reuse of TOTP tokens within their validity period. This violates the fundamental principle of one-time passwords.\"\n\nThe selection of CWE-287 is primarily driven by the evidence that authentication is present but flawed. CWE-306 was considered but rejected as it describes a complete lack of authentication, which is not the case here. CWE-307 was also considered as a contributing factor, but the primary issue is the **improper** handling of TOTP tokens, making CWE-287 the most appropriate choice. While CWE-287 is a Class-level CWE and discouraged, it is still the best fit as there are no better Base-level CWEs that fit the **improper authentication** in the vulnerability description.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-208: Observable Timing Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTwo separate operations in a product require different amounts of time to complete, in a way that is observable to an actor and reveals security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
