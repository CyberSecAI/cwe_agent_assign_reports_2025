In this case, it leads to Stored XSS (CWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')]). CWE-352 is a compound weakness, while CWE-79 is a base weakness. The selection of CWE-352 as primary and CWE-79 as secondary reflects this relationship.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    \n    cwe79 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe352\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe352 primary\n    class cwe79 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with CWE-352 [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)], allowing an attacker to potentially force actions on behalf of a user. If the application doesn't properly neutralize input, this can lead to CWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')], resulting in stored XSS.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that there's a **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** vulnerability that leads to Stored **XSS**. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section also highlights **Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** as the root cause.\n\nThe retriever results show that CWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')] and CWE-352 [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)] are the top candidates. Given that CSRF is the root cause and XSS is the result, CWE-352 is chosen as the primary CWE, and CWE-79 is the secondary CWE.\n\nThe evidence provided supports the selection of these CWEs, and their relationship (CSRF leading to XSS) is also reflected in the classification.
