A resulting action, in this case, is stored XSS, represented by CWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')]. There isn't a direct relationship between CSRF and XSS in the CWE structure, but the vulnerability description clearly indicates that CSRF is the cause, and the stored XSS is the impact.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    \n    cwe352 -->|LEADS_TO| cwe79\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe352 primary\n    class cwe79 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with CWE-352 [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)]. Due to the CSRF vulnerability, an attacker can inject malicious scripts into the system, which leads to CWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')] and results in Stored XSS.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states a **Cross-Site Request Forgery** (CSRF) vulnerability leading to stored XSS. The primary root cause is CWE-352 [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)], as it is the mechanism that allows the attacker to perform unwanted actions. The resulting stored XSS is best represented by CWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')], as the injected input is not properly neutralized.\n\nThe evidence for CWE-352 [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)] is: \"Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in Pascal Casier Board Election allows Stored XSS.\"\n\nThe evidence for CWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')] is: \"This issue affects Board Election from n/a through 1.0.1.\" and the general knowledge that Stored XSS involves **improper neutralization of input**.\n\nThe retriever results also support the selection of CWE-352 and CWE-79, with high scores, indicating relevance to the vulnerability description.\n\nOther CWEs considered but not used:\n\n*   CWE-89 [Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')], CWE-918 [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)], CWE-601 [URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')], CWE-113 [Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')], CWE-80 [Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)], CWE-96 [Improper Neutralization of Directives in Statically Saved Code ('Static Code Injection')], and CWE-472 [External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter] were

Improper validation of data that are user-controllable can lead to the application processing incorrect, and often malicious, input.\n\n\nFor example, custom cookies commonly store session data or persistent data across sessions. This kind of session data is normally involved in security related decisions on the server side, such as user authentication and access control. Thus, the cookies might contain sensitive data such as user credentials and privileges. This is a dangerous practice, as it can often lead to improper reliance on the value of the client-provided cookie by the server side application.\n",
