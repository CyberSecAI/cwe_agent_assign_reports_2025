  "query": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved Input mtk-pmic-keys - fix possible null pointer dereference In mtk_pmic_keys_probe, the regs parameter is only set if the button is parsed in the device tree. However, on hardware where the button is left floating, that node will most likely be removed not to enable that input. In that case the code will try to dereference a null pointer. Lets use the regs struct instead as it is defined for all supported platforms. Note that it is ok setting the key reg even if that latter is disabled as the interrupt wont be enabled anyway.",
