**Root cause of vulnerability:**

A hard-coded password was used by Netwrix Directory Manager (formerly Imanami GroupID) v10 and earlier. While the password was replaced with customer-supplied credentials starting in v9, the hard-coded user account was not removed from the installer and persists on the Windows server.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Hard-coded credentials
*   Persistence of a hard-coded user account even after upgrades.

**Impact of exploitation:**

An attacker with network access to Netwrix Directory Manager could potentially authenticate as an administrator to the Windows server on which it is installed or to the product itself, compromising the system and any integrated Identity Stores.

**Attack vectors:**

*   Network access to Netwrix Directory Manager.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   Ability to communicate over any network on which Netwrix Directory Manager is accessible.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   **Immediate:** Disable internet access to Netwrix Directory Manager.
*   **Update:** Upgrade to the latest release of v10 (v10 SR2 (10.0.7784.0) or later).
*   **Remediation:** Examine IIS Application Pools for the use of the `GroupIDSSUser` as the Application Pool Identity. If found, create a new service account and update the Application Pool Identity, then delete the `GroupIDSSUser` local Windows account.
