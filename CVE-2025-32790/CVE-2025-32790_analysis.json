  "description": "Dify is an open-source LLM app development platform. In versions 0.6.8 and prior, a vulnerability was identified in the DIFY AI where normal users are **improperly granted permissions** to export APP DSL. The feature in /export should only allow administrator users to export DSL. A workaround for this vulnerability involves updating the access control mechanisms to enforce stricter user role permissions and implementing role-based access controls (RBAC) to ensure that only users with admin privileges can export the APP DSL. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.6.13.",

While more specific base-level CWEs could potentially exist, the provided information doesn't give enough details to pinpoint a more specific weakness. CWE-266 (Incorrect Privilege Assignment) is considered as a secondary candidate because the vulnerability involves the **improper granting of permissions**, which can be interpreted as an incorrect privilege assignment.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe266[\"CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\"]\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe266 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper granting of permissions** to normal users, leading to them being able to export APP DSL, a function that should be restricted to administrator users.\n  - **Root Cause:** **Improper granting of permissions**\n  - **Weakness:** Incorrect Authorization\n  - **Impact:** Normal users can export APP DSL, leading to potential Intellectual Property Theft and Unauthorized Access.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **improper granting of permissions** to normal users. The retriever results pointed to CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization), CWE-285 (Improper Authorization), and CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) as potential candidates. Based on the vulnerability description and the provided guidance, CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) was selected as the primary CWE because the application performs an authorization check but does it incorrectly by allowing normal users to export APP DSL. The evidence from the vulnerability description, specifically the phrase \"**improperly granted permissions**,\" supports this classification. CWE-266 (Incorrect Privilege Assignment) was considered as a secondary candidate because the **improper granting of permissions** can also be interpreted as an incorrect privilege assignment. This assessment is heavily based on the evidence provided in the vulnerability description and CVE reference links content summary.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
