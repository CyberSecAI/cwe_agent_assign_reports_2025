CWE-352 is a compound weakness, while CWE-79 is a base weakness. There isn't a direct relationship between these two in the CWE database, but in this specific case, successful CSRF enables the attacker to inject malicious scripts that are then stored and executed, hence leading to XSS.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    \n    cwe352 -->|ENABLES| cwe79\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe352 primary\n    class cwe79 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with:\n1.  **Root Cause:** CWE-352 - Cross-Site Request Forgery allows an attacker to forge requests on behalf of a user.\n2.  **Weakness:** This CSRF vulnerability is then exploited to inject malicious code.\n3.  **Impact:** CWE-79 - Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') resulting in Stored XSS.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability is primarily a **Cross-Site Request Forgery** (CSRF) that allows an attacker to inject malicious code leading to Stored **XSS**.\n\nEvidence:\n*   \"**Cross-Site Request Forgery** (CSRF) vulnerability in thunderbax WP Admin Custom Page allows Stored **XSS**.\"\n*   \"**Root cause of vulnerability:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"\n*   \"**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) in WP Admin Custom Page plugin.\"\n*   \"**Impact of exploitation:** Allows a malicious actor to force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.\"\n\nBased on the retriever results and the vulnerability description, the primary CWE is CWE-352 because the **rootcause** is CSRF.
