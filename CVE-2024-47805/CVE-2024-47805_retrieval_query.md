# Retrieval Query for CVE-2024-47805

## Vulnerability Description
Jenkins Credentials Plugin 1380.va_435002fa_924 and earlier, except 1371.1373.v4eb_fa_b_7161e9, does not redact encrypted values of credentials using the `SecretBytes` type when accessing item `config.xml` via REST API or CLI.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** redact encrypted values of credentials
- **vector:** accessing item config.xml
- **product:** Jenkins Credentials Plugin
- **version:** 1380.va_435002fa_924 and earlier
- **component:** REST API or CLI

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2024-47805:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Credentials Plugin did not redact encrypted values of credentials using the `SecretBytes` type when accessing item `config.xml` via REST API or CLI.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Exposure of encrypted credentials: The plugin failed to properly redact encrypted `SecretBytes` values when accessed through the REST API or CLI, specifically when retrieving an item's `config.xml`.
- Lack of proper data sanitization or redaction: The plugin didn't sanitize or redact sensitive encrypted credential data before exposing it to users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: Attackers with Item/Extended Read permission can view the encrypted values of `SecretBytes` type credentials, such as certificate credentials or secret file credentials. This could lead to the compromise of the system/application protected by these credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
- REST API access: By making API calls to retrieve the `config.xml` of an item.
- CLI access: By using the Jenkins CLI to retrieve the `config.xml` of an item.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Must have Item/Extended Read permission within Jenkins.
- Must be able to access the Jenkins instance (network access).

**Affected plugin and versions:**
- `credentials` plugin versions up to and including 1380.va\_435002fa\_924, except 1371.1373.v4eb\_fa\_b\_7161e9.

**Fixed plugin version:**
- `credentials` plugin version 1381.v2c3a\_12074da\_b\_

**Additional notes:**
- The fix for this issue is only fully effective on Jenkins 2.479 and newer, or LTS 2.462.3 and newer. While the patched Credentials Plugin can be installed on older Jenkins versions, the encrypted values will not be redacted.
- This issue is similar to an older vulnerability (SECURITY-266) that affected inline secrets and some credential types.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
Storing a password in plaintext may result in a system compromise.

### Extended Description
Password management issues occur when a password is stored in plaintext in an application's properties, configuration file, or memory. Storing a plaintext password in a configuration file allows anyone who can read the file access to the password-protected resource. In some contexts, even storage of a plaintext password in memory is considered a security risk if the password is not cleared immediately after it is used.

### Alternative Terms

### Additional Notes
**[Terminology]** 

Assuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-39155:** Chain: A microservice integration and management platform compares the hostname in the HTTP Host header in a case-sensitive way (CWE-178, CWE-1289), allowing bypass of the authorization policy (CWE-863) using a hostname with mixed case or other variations.
- **CVE-2019-15900:** Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).
- **CVE-2009-2213:** Gateway uses default "Allow" configuration for its authorization settings.




## CWE-257: Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The storage of passwords in a recoverable format makes them subject to password reuse attacks by malicious users. In fact, it should be noted that recoverable encrypted passwords provide no significant benefit over plaintext passwords since they are subject not only to reuse by malicious attackers but also by malicious insiders. If a system administrator can recover a password directly, or use a brute force search on the available information, the administrator can use the password on other accounts.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** The meaning of this entry needs to be investigated more closely, especially with respect to what is meant by "recoverable."



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-30018:** A messaging platform serializes all elements of User/Group objects, making private information available to adversaries




## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-200

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** Depending on usage, this could be a weakness or a category. Further study of all its children is needed, and the entire sub-tree may need to be clarified. The current organization is based primarily on the exposure of sensitive information as a consequence, instead of as a primary weakness.

**[Maintenance]** There is a close relationship with CWE-552, which is more focused on weaknesses. As a result, it may be more appropriate to convert CWE-538 to a category.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2018-1999036:** SSH password for private key stored in build log
