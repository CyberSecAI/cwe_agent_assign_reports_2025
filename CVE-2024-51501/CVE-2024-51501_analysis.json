  "description": "Refit is an automatic type-safe REST library for .NET Core, Xamarin and .NET The various header-related Refit attributes (Header, HeaderCollection and Authorize) are vulnerable to **CRLF injection**. The way HTTP headers are added to a request is via the `HttpHeaders.TryAddWithoutValidation` method. This method does not check for CRLF characters in the header value. This means that any headers added to a refit request are vulnerable to CRLF-injection. In general, CRLF-injection into a HTTP header (when using HTTP/1.1) means that one can inject additional HTTP headers or smuggle whole HTTP requests. If an application using the Refit library passes a user-controllable value through to a header, then that application becomes vulnerable to CRLF-injection. This is not necessarily a security issue for a command line application like the one above, but if such code were present in a web application then it becomes vulnerable to request splitting (as shown in the PoC) and thus Server Side Request Forgery. Strictly speaking this is a potential vulnerability in applications using Refit and not in Refit itself. This issue has been addressed in release versions 7.2.22 and 8.0.0 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",

CWE-113 is a variant of CWE-93, specifying that the CRLF injection occurs in HTTP headers, making it a more specific description of the vulnerability's location. CWE-918 arises as an impact of the CRLF injection leading to request splitting and SSRF. CWE-93 can precede both CWE-113 and CWE-918 in a vulnerability chain.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe93[\"CWE-93: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')\"]\n    cwe113[\"CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\"]\n    cwe918[\"CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n\n    cwe113 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    cwe93 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe113\n    cwe93 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe918\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe93 primary\n    class cwe113,cwe918,cwe20 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper input sanitization** (CWE-93) leading to CRLF injection. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary headers or smuggle HTTP requests (CWE-113), which in turn can lead to request splitting and Server Side Request Forgery (CWE-918).\n\nCWE-93 (Root Cause: **Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences**) -> CWE-113 (Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers) -> CWE-918 (Server-Side Request Forgery)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment and the retriever results point towards CWE-93 and CWE-113 as the most relevant CWEs. The vulnerability description clearly states that the Refit library is vulnerable to **CRLF injection** because `HttpHeaders.TryAddWithoutValidation` method does not check for CRLF characters in the header value. This aligns perfectly with CWE-93, which describes **improper neutralization of CRLF sequences**. The fact that this occurs in HTTP headers leads to the secondary classification of CWE-113. The potential impact, SSRF, further supports the classification, though as an impact rather than a root cause.\n\nThe evidence for **CRLF injection** is strong: \"The way HTTP headers are added to a request is via the `HttpHeaders.TryAddWithoutValidation` method. This method does not check for CRLF characters in the header value. This means that any headers added to a refit request are vulnerable to CRLF-injection.\"\n\nThe graph relationships confirm the hierarchical relationship between CWE-93 and CWE-113, and the potential for CWE-93 to precede CWE-918.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-93 identifies the core weakness, while CWE-113 provides more context by specifying that the CRLF injection occurs in HTTP headers.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives data from an HTTP agent/component (e.g., web server, proxy, browser, etc.), but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CR and LF characters before the data is included in outgoing HTTP headers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Why Chosen**: This is the specific location of the CRLF Injection, so this is a secondary CWE to consider.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n**Why Not Chosen**: This is too generic.
