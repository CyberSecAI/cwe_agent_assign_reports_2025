While other CWEs like CWE-116 (Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output) and CWE-90 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an LDAP Query) were considered, the description explicitly mentioned SQL Injection, making CWE-89 the most specific and relevant choice.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    cwe943[\"CWE-943: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Data Query Logic\"]\n    \n    cwe89 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe89 -->|CHILDOF| cwe943\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe89 primary\n    class cwe74,cwe943 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**, leading to **time-based SQL Injection**, and finally resulting in the ability to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries and extract sensitive information from the database.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description, which explicitly states that the Cost Calculator Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to **time-based SQL Injection**. The root cause is **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This allows attackers to extract sensitive information from the database.\n\nThe retriever results also indicated CWE-89 as the top candidate, further reinforcing the selection. The relationship analysis showed that CWE-89 is a specific type of injection, making it more appropriate than its parent classes.
