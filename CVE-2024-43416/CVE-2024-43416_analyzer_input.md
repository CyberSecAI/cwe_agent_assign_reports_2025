# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-43416

## Vulnerability Description
GLPI is a free asset and IT management software package. Starting in version 0.80 and prior to version 10.0.17, an unauthenticated user can use an application endpoint to check if an email address corresponds to a valid GLPI user. Version 10.0.17 fixes the issue.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** check if email corresponds to valid GLPI user
- **vector:** unauthenticated
- **attacker:** user
- **product:** GLPI
- **version:** 0.80 to 10.0.17
- **component:** application endpoint

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content is related to CVE-2024-43416.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an application endpoint in GLPI that allows an unauthenticated user to check if a given email address corresponds to a valid user within the system. This is done through the "forgot password" functionality.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Email enumeration vulnerability. The application's response allows an attacker to determine whether a provided email exists in the system's user database.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can enumerate valid user email addresses, which can then be used for further targeted attacks such as password spraying, phishing, or other social engineering attempts.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack through the application endpoint for password reset.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- No authentication is required. The attacker only needs network access to the vulnerable GLPI instance.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was patched in version 10.0.17.
- The fix included adding a random delay (`sleep(rand(1, 3))`) to the forget password process, which was added to prevent an attacker from detecting whether a notification was sent based on response time.
- The vulnerability is rated as high severity with a CVSS v3 score of 7.5.
- The attack complexity is low and requires no privileges or user interaction.
- The impact is limited to high confidentiality impact (email enumeration) with no integrity or availability impact.
