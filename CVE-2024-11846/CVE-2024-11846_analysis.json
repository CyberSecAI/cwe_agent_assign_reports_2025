This can lead to: session hijacking, defacement of the website, redirection to malicious sites, stealing of sensitive information, etc. The vulnerability could be used against high-privilege users such as admins, potentially leading to complete site compromise.\n- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a malicious URL that includes a payload in the `tour-search` parameter, an attacker can induce a victim to execute the malicious script by visiting the crafted URL.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL and convince a victim to access it. The victim's browser must be vulnerable to XSS attacks.",
