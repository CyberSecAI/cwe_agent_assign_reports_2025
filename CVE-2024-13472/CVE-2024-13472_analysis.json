  "description": "The The WooCommerce Product Table Lite plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary shortcode execution in all versions up to, and including, 3.9.4. This is due to the software allowing users to execute an action that **does not properly validate a value before running do_shortcode**. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary shortcodes. The same sc_attrs parameter is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting as well.",

CWE-79 is selected as a secondary weakness because the `sc_attrs` parameter is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting. CWE-94 is a parent of CWE-96, which was in the retriever results. The choice was made to stay with CWE-94, as there was no evidence of directives in statically saved code.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe96[\"CWE-96: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Statically Saved Code ('Static Code Injection')\"]\n    \n    cwe96 -->|CHILDOF| cwe94\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe94 primary\n    class cwe79 secondary\n    class cwe96 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the software **not properly validating a value before running do_shortcode**, leading to the ability for unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary shortcodes (CWE-94). The same `sc_attrs` parameter is also vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (CWE-79).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary assessment is based on the provided vulnerability description, which states that the software **does not properly validate a value before running do_shortcode**. This aligns with CWE-94, Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection'). The description also indicates that the same parameter is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (CWE-79), which is added as a secondary weakness.
