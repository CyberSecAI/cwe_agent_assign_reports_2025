## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability classified as critical was found in Open Asset Import Library Assimp 5.4.3. This vulnerability affects the function AssimpGetNextLine in the library ParsingUtils.h of the component File Handler. The manipulation leads to **stack-based buffer overflow**. The attack can be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **product:** Open Asset Import Library Assimp
- **version:** 5.4.3
- **component:** AssimpGetNextLine in ParsingUtils.h of File Handler

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-2151 (PLACEHOLDER) based on provided content:

The provided content details a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the `Assimp::GetNextLine` function of the Assimp library.  This vulnerability is identified in both issues #6016 and #6026 on the assimp GitHub repository. Issue #6026 is closed as a duplicate of #6016.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability occurs because the `Assimp::GetNextLine` function does not properly check buffer boundaries when parsing input data, leading to a write operation beyond the allocated memory. Specifically, the code fails to ensure that the `buffer` size is less than `BufferSize(4096)` before writing to the `line` variable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Stack-based Buffer Overflow:** (CWE-121) - The core vulnerability.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The function lacks adequate checks to prevent writing beyond the allocated buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**

An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability to cause a remote code execution if they can trick the victim into running Assimp on a malformed file.  The provided reports indicate a crash (segmentation fault) as a result of the overflow.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Malicious File:** An attacker could craft a specially designed file that, when processed by Assimp, triggers the buffer overflow.
*   **File Parsing:** The vulnerability is triggered during the parsing of a file using the `Assimp::GetNextLine` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to provide a file to the application using the Assimp library.
*   No specific privileges are mentioned, suggesting a local or remote attacker could potentially exploit this.

**Mitigation or fix:**

The content does not explicitly state a fix, but implies that proper bounds checking within the `Assimp::GetNextLine` function is required to prevent the overflow.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Versions:** assimp >= 5.4.3
*   **PoC:** Proof-of-concept code and a crash file (`assimp_crash_1.zip`) are provided, demonstrating the vulnerability.
*   **Fuzzing:** The vulnerability was discovered through fuzzing.
*   **Sanitizer Report:** AddressSanitizer (ASan) was used to detect the stack-buffer-overflow.

**Compared to official CVE description:**

Since the CVE description is a placeholder, this analysis provides significantly more detail than the official description currently available.
