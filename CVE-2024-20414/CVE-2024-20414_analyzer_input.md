# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-20414

## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability in the web UI feature of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack on an affected system through the web UI. This vulnerability is due to **incorrectly accepting configuration changes through the HTTP GET method**. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a currently authenticated administrator to follow a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to change the configuration of the affected device.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **incorrectly accepting configuration changes through the HTTP GET method**
- **impact:** change the configuration of the affected device
- **vector:** cross-site request forgery
- **attacker:** unauthenticated remote attacker
- **product:** Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software
- **component:** web UI

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to the web UI incorrectly accepting configuration changes through the HTTP GET method.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability. The web UI does not properly validate the origin of configuration change requests, allowing an attacker to forge requests.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit could allow the attacker to change the configuration of the affected device.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can exploit this by persuading a currently authenticated administrator to follow a crafted link. The attacker crafts a malicious link that, when clicked by an authenticated user, sends a forged HTTP GET request to the device to modify its configuration.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious link and trick an authenticated administrator into clicking it. The attacker does not need to be authenticated on the device itself. The attacker must be able to send the crafted link to the administrator via means such as email, chat, or embedding it in a malicious webpage. The user needs to have an active session with the web UI.
