While it is possible that a more specific Base-level CWE exists, the description strongly suggests uncontrolled recursion as the root cause. CWE-674 is related to CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) as recursion is a means for resource consumption. CWE-674 can lead to CWE-400 if the recursion is not properly limited, thus consuming excessive resources.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe674[\"CWE-674: Uncontrolled Recursion\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    \n    cwe674 -->|CAN_LEAD_TO| cwe400\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe674 primary\n    class cwe400 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a malicious YAML payload submitted by an authorized user. The `compose-go` library then attempts to parse this YAML, leading to **uncontrolled recursion**. This **uncontrolled recursion** causes excessive memory and CPU consumption, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis pointed towards several potential CWEs, particularly those related to resource consumption and loop vulnerabilities. However, the key phrase \"recursive loop\" and the GitHub content clearly indicate that the root cause is **uncontrolled recursion** during YAML parsing. The vulnerability description mentions \"consume excessive amount of Memory and CPU cycles\" which means the recursion leads to **uncontrolled resource consumption**.\n\nThe evidence supporting this assessment is strong, with the GitHub content explicitly mentioning a \"recursive loop.\" The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity given the available information.\n\nRelevant CWE
