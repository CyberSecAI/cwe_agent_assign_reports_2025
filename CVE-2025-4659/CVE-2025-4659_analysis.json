  "description": "The Integration for Salesforce and Contact Form 7, WPForms, Elementor, Formidable, Ninja Forms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Full Path Disclosure in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.4. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve the full path of the web application, which can be used to aid other attacks. The information displayed is not useful on its own, and requires another vulnerability to be present for damage to an affected website.",

However, the changelog entry for version 1.4.5 mentions fixing a \"500 error with invalid data\" issue. This suggests a potential vulnerability related to improper input validation or handling, which could lead to a server error and potentially denial of service or other issues.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- Improper input validation/handling (implied by the \"500 error with invalid data\" fix).\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- Server error (500 error).\n- Potential denial of service.\n- Other impacts depending on the nature of the invalid data and how it's processed.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- Submitting invalid data through forms integrated with the plugin.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- Ability to submit data to forms using the plugin. No authentication is required.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n- Updating to version 1.4.5 of the \"WP Contact Form Salesforce\" plugin.\n\n**Note:** This content provides more detail than the official CVE description (which is currently a placeholder). It identifies a specific issue addressed in the update, suggesting a potential vulnerability.",

The retriever results also suggest CWE-201 [Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data] and CWE-209 [Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information], both of which are children of CWE-200. Given that the vulnerability description clearly states the **full path disclosure**, which falls under the broader category of information exposure, CWE-200 seems appropriate. No chain relationships are relevant here.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe209[\"CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe201 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe209 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe201,cwe209 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward: a request to the web application results in the disclosure of the full path due to the **rootcause of full path disclosure**, which then leads to **information disclosure**.\n  - Root Cause: **Full Path Disclosure**\n  - Weakness: **Information Disclosure**\n  - Impact: Retrieving full path of web application\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly indicates a **full path disclosure**, leading to **information disclosure**. The vulnerability description explicitly states the **rootcause of full path disclosure** and the **weakness of information disclosure**.\nThe retriever results identify CWE-200 [Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor] as the top candidate, and this aligns well with the vulnerability description.
