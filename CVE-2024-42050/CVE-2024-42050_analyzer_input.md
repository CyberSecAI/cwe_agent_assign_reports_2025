# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-42050

## Vulnerability Description
The MSI installer for Splashtop Streamer for Windows before 3.7.0.0 uses a temporary folder with **weak permissions** during installation. A local user can exploit this to escalate privileges to SYSTEM via an oplock on CredProvider_Inst.reg.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **weak permissions**
- **impact:** escalate privileges to SYSTEM
- **vector:** oplock on CredProvider_Inst.reg
- **attacker:** local user
- **product:** Splashtop Streamer for Windows
- **version:** before 3.7.0.0
- **component:** MSI installer

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is the use of a temporary folder with weak permissions by the Splashtop Streamer MSI installer during installation/reinstallation. This allows a local authenticated user to write to a file used in a SYSTEM context.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Weak Temporary Folder Permissions:** The MSI installer uses a temporary folder (within the user's `%TEMP%` directory) with permissions that allow write access to the current user.
*   **Unprotected File Loading:** A `.reg` file (`CredProvider_Inst.reg`) is loaded from this user-writable folder during installation/reinstallation.
*   **Race Condition:** The vulnerability exploits a race condition where an attacker can overwrite the `.reg` file after setting an oplock and before the file is loaded in the SYSTEM context.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Privilege Escalation:** By writing arbitrary content into the `.reg` file, the attacker can modify the registry under the `SYSTEM` context.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Specifically, the attacker can create a `Debugger` value within the `Image File Execution Options` registry key to cause a SYSTEM process to execute an attacker-controlled binary.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the Windows machine.
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the system.
*   **Reinstallation Trigger:** The attacker triggers a reinstallation of the Splashtop Streamer using the original MSI installer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   Local authenticated user account on the target Windows system.
*   Ability to execute the Splashtop Streamer MSI installer (by having access to the installer or copying it back to its original location).
*   Ability to set an oplock on a file and overwrite it before a specific action is performed on it by the system.

**Additional Details:**
*   The attacker uses an oplock to win the race condition and overwrite the `.reg` file before it is loaded by the installer.
*   The specific method used for the privilege escalation is setting the `Debugger` value under `Image File Execution Options`, which allows an attacker to specify an arbitrary binary to be executed whenever the specified system binary is started.
*   The vulnerability affects Splashtop Streamer for Windows versions prior to 3.7.0.0.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* 🔍 *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* 🔍 *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion – CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### 🔸 CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ✅ *“A user created with the ‘guest’ role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ✅ *“The backup service runs as root but only needs read access.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ⚠️ This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### 🔸 CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ✅ *“User can access another user’s invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.”*

## Mapping Examples – Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *“User can escalate privileges to admin.”*
> ❌ Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged – only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ✅ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**

## Good Mapping Examples – Privileges & Permissions

* ✅ **CWE-266**: *“When a new user registers, the system assigns them admin role due to a missing role validation.”*
* ✅ **CWE-250**: *“Installer runs with system-level privileges but doesn't require them to install files in the user directory.”*
* ✅ **CWE-284**: *“Inconsistent access rules between UI and backend for sensitive endpoints.”*
* ✅ **CWE-285**: *“Authorization logic fails to restrict access to finance reports based on department.”*
