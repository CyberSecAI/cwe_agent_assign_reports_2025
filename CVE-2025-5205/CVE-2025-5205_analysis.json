Attackers can inject malicious SQL queries because user input is directly used in SQL queries without sanitization or validation.\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection\n*   **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthorized database access, sensitive data leakage, data tampering, comprehensive system control, and even service interruption.\n*   **Attack vectors:** Exploitation of the `/dcwr_entry.php` file. The attacker sends a crafted POST request including malicious SQL code within the 'date' parameter.\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint and craft a malicious payload.\n*   **Mitigation or fix:**\n    *   Use prepared statements and parameter binding.\n    *   Input validation and filtering.\n    *   Minimize database user permissions.\n    *   Regular security audits.\n*   **More detail than CVE description:** Yes, it provides the vulnerable file, parameter, a sample payload, and screenshots from a scan.\n\n**Response:**\n\n```\nRoot cause of vulnerability: A SQL injection vulnerability exists in the '/dcwr_entry.php' file of the 'Daily College Class Work Report Book PHP Project Code.'
