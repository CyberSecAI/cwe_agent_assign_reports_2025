- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to forge requests.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful CSRF attack could force higher-privileged users to perform unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact varies depending on the actions the user is forced to perform.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts a malicious request and tricks a logged-in, privileged user into executing it (e.g., through a link or embedded image on a malicious website or email).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to entice a logged-in user with sufficient privileges to click a malicious link or visit a malicious page, and must be able to craft a specific request to exploit the plugin's functionality.
