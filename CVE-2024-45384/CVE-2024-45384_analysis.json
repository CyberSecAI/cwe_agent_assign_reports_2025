  "description": "**Padding Oracle vulnerability** in Apache Druid extension, druid-pac4j. This could allow an attacker to manipulate a pac4j session cookie. This issue affects Apache Druid versions 0.18.0 through 30.0.0. Since the druid-pac4j extension is optional and disabled by default, Druid installations not using the druid-pac4j extension are not affected by this vulnerability. While we are not aware of a way to meaningfully exploit this flaw, we nevertheless recommend upgrading to version 30.0.1 or higher which fixes the issue and ensuring you have a strong druid.auth.pac4j.cookiePassphrase as a precaution.",

  "reference_content": "- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Padding Oracle vulnerability in the `druid-pac4j` extension of Apache Druid.\n- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is a Padding Oracle vulnerability. This type of vulnerability arises when an application improperly handles padding during cryptographic operations, allowing an attacker to decrypt ciphertext by observing error messages. Specifically, in this case, it allows an attacker to manipulate the pac4j session cookie.\n- **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker can manipulate the pac4j session cookie. While a meaningful way to exploit this is unknown, it could lead to unauthorized access or other malicious activities, depending on the cookie's content and usage within the application.\n- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by manipulating the `pac4j` session cookie.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the application and modify the `pac4j` session cookie. The specifics of how an attacker manipulates the cookie (e.g., by intercepting and modifying it during transit) are not detailed. However, they must be able to send crafted cookie values to the server to trigger the padding oracle.",

The **Padding Oracle vulnerability** allows an attacker to observe discrepancies based on the timing or error messages, hence the selection of CWE-203. CWE-327 is related because a padding oracle is often associated with the use of a broken or weak cryptographic algorithm or implementation.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe203[\"CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy\"]\n    cwe208[\"CWE-208: Observable Timing Discrepancy\"]\n    cwe327[\"CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\"]\n    \n    cwe208 -->|CHILDOF| cwe203\n    cwe208 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe327\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe203 primary\n    class cwe327 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **Padding Oracle vulnerability** (CWE-N/A) leading to observable discrepancies (CWE-203), potentially due to a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm (CWE-327), and finally resulting in the ability to manipulate a `pac4j` session cookie.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis considered several CWEs from the Retriever Results, but the primary focus shifted towards identifying the root cause and the observable impact. The evidence from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary highlights the **Padding Oracle vulnerability** and the ability to observe discrepancies, which directly maps to CWE-203.\n\nThe selection of CWE-203 is based on the fact that a **Padding Oracle vulnerability** inherently relies on observing differences in the application's behavior (e.g., error messages, timing) to decrypt or manipulate data.
