- **version:** 4.19.1.0

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-42222:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
A regression in the network listing API within Apache CloudStack 4.19.1.0.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  **Unauthorised Access:** The network listing API allows domain admins and normal users to access network details that do not belong to their domain.
- **Tenant Isolation Breach:** This unauthorized access compromises tenant isolation within the cloud environment.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorised access to network details:** Attackers can gain access to sensitive network details, configurations, and data. This can lead to further attacks if the attacker can glean sensitive information from the configurations.
- **Compromised tenant isolation**: Tenant isolation is compromised which can lead to further lateral movements within the cloud infrastructure.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is accessible through the network listing API.
- An attacker would need valid credentials to log into the CloudStack UI or API.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a domain admin or a normal user account within an Apache CloudStack 4.19.1.0 environment.
- The attacker needs to be able to log into the CloudStack UI or utilize the API.

**Additional details:**

*   The issue is specific to Apache CloudStack version 4.19.1.0.
*   The vulnerability was introduced as a regression.
*   The issue was fixed in version 4.19.1.1.
*   Users of versions prior to 4.19.1.0 are recommended to upgrade directly to 4.19.1.1.
*   The vulnerability allows domain admins to view networks belonging to other domains. It was initially reported that normal users were not affected, but further investigation revealed that normal users could also see other domain networks by using the "shared" filter.
