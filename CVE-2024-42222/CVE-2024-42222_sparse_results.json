This vulnerability compromises tenant isolation, potentially leading to unauthorised access to network details, configurations and data. Affected users are advised to upgrade to version 4.19.1.1 to address this issue. Users on older versions of CloudStack considering to upgrade, can skip 4.19.1.0 and upgrade directly to 4.19.1.1.",
