  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-4058 Content\n\nThe provided content **RELATES** to a SQL injection vulnerability. It provides significantly more detail than a typical CVE description would.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe root cause is the lack of proper input validation and sanitization of the `Pat_BloodGroup1` parameter in the `/Bloodgroop_process.php` file.  The application directly uses this parameter in SQL queries without appropriate cleaning, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL code.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   SQL Injection\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   Unauthorized database access\n*   Sensitive data leakage\n*   Data tampering\n*   System control\n*   Service interruption\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   POST request parameter manipulation: Specifically, the `Pat_BloodGroup1` parameter.\n*   Various SQL injection payloads (boolean-based blind, error-based, time-based blind, UNION query) are provided as examples.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   No login or authorization is required.\n*   Attacker needs to be able to send crafted POST requests to the `/Bloodgroop_process.php` endpoint.\n*   Knowledge of SQL injection techniques and payloads.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n1.  **Use prepared statements and parameter binding:** This separates SQL code from user input.\n2.  **Input validation and filtering:**  Ensure user input conforms to the expected format.\n3.  **Minimize database user permissions:** Use accounts with the least necessary privileges.\n4.  **Regular security audits:** Conduct regular code and system security audits.\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   **Affected Product:** Hospital Database Management System Project using PHP & MySQL\n*   **Vendor Homepage:** [https://projectworlds.in/free-projects/php-projects/online-examination/](https://projectworlds.in/free-projects/php-projects/online-examination/)\n*   **Vulnerable File:** `/Bloodgroop_process.php`\n*   **Version:** V1.0\n*   **Software Link:** [https://1000projects.org/hospital-database-management-system-project-using-php-mysql.html](https://1000projects.org/hospital-database-management-system-project-using-php-mysql.html)\n*   Payload examples and screenshots of `sqlmap` usage are provided.",
