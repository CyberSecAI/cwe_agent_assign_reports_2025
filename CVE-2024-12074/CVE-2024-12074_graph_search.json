The vulnerability is due to improper handling of form-data with a large filename in the file upload request. By sending a payload with an excessively large filename, the server becomes overwhelmed and unresponsive, leading to unavailability for legitimate users. This issue can be exploited without authentication, making it highly scalable and increasing the risk of exploitation. Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-1284 CWE-646 CWE-799 CWE-770 CWE-89 CWE-434 CWE-400 CWE-306",
