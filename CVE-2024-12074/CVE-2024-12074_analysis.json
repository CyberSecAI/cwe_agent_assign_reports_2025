  "description": "A Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability was discovered in the file upload feature of automatic1111/stable-diffusion-webui version 1.10.0. The vulnerability is due to **improper handling of form-data with a large filename in the file upload request**. By sending a payload with an excessively large filename, the server becomes overwhelmed and unresponsive, leading to unavailability for legitimate users. This issue can be exploited without authentication, making it highly scalable and increasing the risk of exploitation.",

CWE-770 is a child of CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption), which represents the impact of the vulnerability, a denial-of-service condition due to resource exhaustion.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    \n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe770 primary\n    class cwe400 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper handling of form-data with a large filename** (CWE-770), leading to excessive resource allocation. This, in turn, causes the server to become overwhelmed and unresponsive, resulting in a denial-of-service (CWE-400).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is primarily based on the vulnerability description, which clearly states the **improper handling of form-data with a large filename** as the **root cause** and the resulting denial-of-service as the impact.\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"The vulnerability is due to **improper handling of form-data with a large filename in the file upload request**. By sending a payload with an excessively large filename, the server becomes overwhelmed and unresponsive, leading to unavailability for legitimate users.\"\n\nCWE-770 is chosen as the primary CWE because it directly addresses the **root cause** of the vulnerability, which is the allocation of resources without limits or throttling. CWE-400 is considered as a secondary CWE because it describes the resulting impact of the vulnerability, which is uncontrolled resource consumption leading to denial-of-service.
