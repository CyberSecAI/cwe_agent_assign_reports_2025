# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-20330

## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability in the Snort 2 and Snort 3 TCP and UDP detection engine of Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software for Cisco Firepower 2100 Series Appliances could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause **memory corruption**, which could cause the Snort detection engine to restart unexpectedly. This vulnerability is due to **improper memory management** when the Snort detection engine processes specific TCP or UDP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted TCP or UDP packets through a device that is inspecting traffic using the Snort detection engine. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to restart the Snort detection engine repeatedly, which could cause a denial of service (DoS) condition. The DoS condition impacts only the traffic through the device that is examined by the Snort detection engine. The device can still be managed over the network. Note Once a memory block is corrupted, it cannot be cleared until the Cisco Firepower 2100 Series Appliance is manually reloaded. This means that the Snort detection engine could crash repeatedly, causing traffic that is processed by the Snort detection engine to be dropped until the device is manually reloaded.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **improper memory management**
- **weakness:** **memory corruption**
- **impact:** denial of service and memory corruption
- **vector:** crafted TCP or UDP packets
- **attacker:** unauthenticated remote attacker
- **product:** Cisco Firepower 2100 Series Appliances
- **component:** Snort TCP and UDP detection engine

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2024-20330:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is caused by improper memory management within the Snort 2 and Snort 3 TCP and UDP detection engine of Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software when processing specific TCP or UDP packets.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper memory management leading to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated, remote attacker can cause memory corruption in the Snort detection engine.
- This corruption can lead to the unexpected restart of the Snort detection engine.
- Repeated restarts of the Snort detection engine result in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition by dropping traffic that is processed by the Snort engine.
- The device itself remains manageable over the network, but traffic inspection is disrupted.
- Once memory is corrupted, it remains corrupted until a manual reload of the appliance.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending crafted TCP or UDP packets through a device using the vulnerable Snort detection engine.
- Remote, unauthenticated attacker.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send network traffic to the targeted Firepower 2100 appliance.
- No authentication is required.

**Affected Products:**
- Cisco Firepower 2100 Series Appliances running a vulnerable version of Cisco FTD Software that has a Snort intrusion policy configured.
- Both Snort 2 and Snort 3 are vulnerable.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in both Snort 2 and Snort 3, depending on the configured version on the FTD appliance.
- No workarounds are available.
- Fixed software updates are available from Cisco.
