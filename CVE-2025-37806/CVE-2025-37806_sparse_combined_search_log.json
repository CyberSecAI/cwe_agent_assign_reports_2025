[1] Before the write operation is completed, the user executes ioctl[2] to clear the compress flag of the file, which causes the is_compressed() judgment to return 0, further causing the program to enter the wrong process and call the wrong ops ntfs_aops_cmpr, which triggers the null pointer dereference of write_begin. Use inode lock to synchronize ioctl and write to avoid this case.
