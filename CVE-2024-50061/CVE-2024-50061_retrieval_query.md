# Vulnerability Description

    In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved i3c master cdns Fix **use after free** vulnerability in cdns_i3c_master Driver Due to Race Condition In the cdns_i3c_master_probe function, &master->hj_work is bound with cdns_i3c_master_hj. And cdns_i3c_master_interrupt can call cnds_i3c_master_demux_ibis function to start the work. If we remove the module which will call cdns_i3c_master_remove to make cleanup, it will free master->base through i3c_master_unregister while the work mentioned above will be used. The sequence of operations that may lead to a UAF bug is as follows CPU0 CPU1 | cdns_i3c_master_hj cdns_i3c_master_remove | i3c_master_unregister(&master->base) | device_unregister(&master->dev) | device_release | //free master->base | | i3c_master_do_daa(&master->base) | //use master->base Fix it by ensuring that the work is canceled before proceeding with the cleanup in cdns_i3c_master_remove.

    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis
    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. 
    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.

    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'race condition'

Relevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:

### 1. CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') (Score: 655.35)

The product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently....

### 2. CWE-61: UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following (Score: 605.94)

The product, when opening a file or directory, does not sufficiently account for when the file is a symbolic link that resolves to a target outside of the intended control sphere. This could allow an attacker to cause the product to operate on unauthorized files....

### 3. CWE-415: Double Free (Score: 593.60)

The product calls free() twice on the same memory address, potentially leading to modification of unexpected memory locations....

### 4. CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition (Score: 589.77)

The product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check. This can cause the product to perform invalid actions when the resource is in an unexpected state....

### 5. CWE-667: Improper Locking (Score: 583.71)

The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors....
