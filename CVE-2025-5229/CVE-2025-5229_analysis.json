The argument `viewid` is directly used in an SQL query without proper sanitization, leading to SQL injection. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship is that CWE-89 is a base-level CWE, which is preferred for mapping root causes. There are several potential chain relationships from the retriever, but they are not relevant in this case since the description is focused on the SQL injection vulnerability. There aren't other relationships that impact the decision because the evidence points directly to SQL injection.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe89 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain consists of:\n1.  **Root Cause:** Improper handling of the `viewid` argument leading to **SQL injection**.\n2.  **Impact:** Unauthorized database access, sensitive data leakage, data tampering, comprehensive system control, and service interruption.\n\nThe chain is direct, from the **improper** input handling to the SQL injection and the resulting impact.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis indicated a clear SQL injection vulnerability based on the provided evidence. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions that the manipulation of the argument `viewid` leads to **sql injection**. The CVE reference link content summary confirms this, stating that attackers inject malicious code from the 'viewid' parameter and use it directly in SQL queries without appropriate cleaning or validation. The retriever results also strongly suggest CWE-89 as the primary candidate.\n\nThe selection of CWE-89 is based on direct evidence from the vulnerability description and the CVE reference. The provided evidence is strong, and the mapping aligns with the CWE description and mapping guidance. The level of specificity is appropriate, as CWE-89 is a base-level CWE that accurately describes the root cause of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.
