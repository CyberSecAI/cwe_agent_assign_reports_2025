  "description": "ICG.AspNetCore.Utilities.CloudStorage is a collection of cloud storage utilities to assist with the management of files for cloud upload. Users of this library that set a duration for a SAS Uri with a value other than 1 hour may have generated a URL with a duration that is longer, or shorter than desired. Users not implemented SAS Uris are unaffected. This issue was resolved in version 8.0.0 of the library.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-50353:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from an issue in how the `ICG.AspNetCore.Utilities.CloudStorage` library generates Shared Access Signature (SAS) URLs for Azure Blob Storage. The library was incorrectly setting the expiration time for SAS tokens. Instead of using the specified `tokenDuration` (in minutes), the code was hardcoded to add 1 hour.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Incorrect SAS Token Duration:** The primary vulnerability is that the generated SAS URLs had an expiration time that was either longer or shorter than intended by the user. This means that a token could be valid for more or less time than the user expected, leading to potential unintended access to resources.\n*   **Authorization Bypass:** While the issue is with the duration and not authorization itself, an attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability if the generated SAS token has excessive validity period compared to the intention and use that longer time period to gain access to the resource\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to the Azure Blob Storage resources if they were able to obtain an SAS URL with an extended validity period.\n*   **Data Exposure:** If an attacker obtained an SAS URL that was valid for a longer time, they could potentially access and download or modify sensitive data.\n*   **Unpredictable Access:** Since the duration could be shorter than expected too, it could potentially interrupt the intended usage.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, as an attacker would need to obtain a crafted SAS URL to exploit the vulnerability.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   The attacker needs to be in a position where they can obtain a SAS URL generated by the vulnerable library (ICG.AspNetCore.Utilities.CloudStorage version < 8.0.0).\n* No specific level of privilege required since the vulnerability is exploitable through generated URL if the duration is longer.\n* No user interaction is required, attacker can exploit it if they have URL\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n*   The vulnerability is present in versions prior to 8.0.0 of the library.\n*   The issue was fixed in version 8.0.0 by using AddMinutes(tokenDuration) instead of AddHours(1).\n*   The CVSS score is 5.3, classified as \"Moderate,\" with a CVSS vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N.\n*   The weakness is categorized as CWE-284 (Improper Access Control).\n\nIn summary, the vulnerability is related to the improper handling of token duration for SAS URLs, which could lead to unintended access to Azure Blob Storage resources, with network based attack vector.",

This CWE reflects the **incorrect** handling of the SAS URI duration, leading to URLs with unexpected lifespans. CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere) is considered as a possible secondary CWE because the **improper** duration could lead to unintended access, which relates to exposing the resource to the wrong control sphere. However, CWE-672 is more specific to the root cause, focusing on the **improper** operation related to the SAS URI's lifecycle.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe672[\"CWE-672: Operation on Resource that is Dead, Dormant, or Obsolete\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n\n    class cwe672 primary\n    class cwe668 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe chain starts with the **improper SAS Uri duration setting** (CWE-672), which leads to the generation of URLs with unexpected durations. The impact is a potentially longer or shorter validity period, which could lead to unauthorized access or disruption of intended usage.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe primary assessment is based on the vulnerability description, which highlights the **improper** handling of SAS URI durations. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary explicitly states that the library was incorrectly setting the expiration time for SAS tokens. This aligns with CWE-672, which describes operations on resources that are dead, dormant, or obsolete.\n\nThe relationship analysis indicates that CWE-672 is the most specific and relevant CWE. The retriever results suggested other CWEs, like CWE-668, CWE-212 (Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer), and CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key). However, these are less directly related to the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **incorrect** handling of the SAS URI duration.\n\nCWE-672 is at the Base level of abstraction, which is appropriate for this vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Why Not Used:** While sensitive information is involved, the root cause is not the removal of this information, but rather the incorrect handling of the duration.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
