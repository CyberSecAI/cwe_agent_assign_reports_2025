The attacker relies on a logged-in user with sufficient permissions to inadvertently trigger the forged request.\\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious request and trick an authenticated user into executing it. The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated on the target system themselves. The attacker could deliver the malicious request via malicious links, scripts or websites.\", similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {}, 'top_cwes_by_threshold': {}}}, similarity_summary=SimilarityInsight(consensus_cwe='', top_cwes=[], confidence_levels={}, total_samples=0), analysis='', analysis_with_relationships='', criticism='', resolution='', relevant_cwes=[{'metadata': {'doc_id': '352', 'name': 'Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'rootcause:lack of CSRF protection', 'keyphrase': 'lack of CSRF protection', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'weakness:Cross-Site Scripting', 'keyphrase': 'Cross-Site Scripting', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'weakness:XSS', 'keyphrase': 'XSS', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'impact:Stored XSS', 'keyphrase': 'Stored XSS', 'type': 'impact'}, {'id': 'product:Ahmet Imamoglu Ahmeti Wp Timeline', 'keyphrase': 'Ahmet Imamoglu Ahmeti Wp Timeline', 'type': 'product'}, {'id': 'version:n/a through 5.1', 'keyphrase': 'n/a through 5.1', 'type': 'version'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(302.1368946226687)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '434', 'name': 'Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'rootcause:lack of CSRF protection', 'keyphrase': 'lack of CSRF protection', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'weakness:Cross-Site Scripting', 'keyphrase': 'Cross-Site Scripting', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'weakness:XSS', 'keyphrase': 'XSS', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'impact:Stored XSS', 'keyphrase': 'Stored XSS', 'type': 'impact'}, {'id': 'product:Ahmet Imamoglu Ahmeti Wp Timeline', 'keyphrase': 'Ahmet Imamoglu Ahmeti Wp Timeline', 'type': 'product'}, {'id': 'version:n/a through 5.1', 'keyphrase': 'n/a through 5.1', 'type': 'version'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(230.44154441472585)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '79', 'name': \"Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\", 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'rootcause:lack of CSRF protection', 'keyphrase': 'lack of CSRF protection', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'weakness:Cross-Site Scripting', 'keyphrase': 'Cross-Site Scripting', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'weakness:XSS', 'keyphrase': 'XSS', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'impact:Stored XSS', 'keyphrase': 'Stored XSS', 'type': 'impact'}, {'id': 'product:Ahmet Imamoglu Ahmeti Wp Timeline', 'keyphrase': 'Ahmet Imamoglu Ahmeti Wp Timeline', 'type': 'product'}, {'id': 'version:n/a through 5.1', 'keyphrase': 'n/a through 5.1', 'type': 'version'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(194.53342756452733)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '116', 'name': 'Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
