# Vulnerability Description

    AutomationDirect C-More EA9 EAP9 File Parsing **Memory Corruption** Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of AutomationDirect C-More EA9. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of EAP9 files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a memory corruption condition. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-24774.
