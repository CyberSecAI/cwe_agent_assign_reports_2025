# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-50633
## Query
A Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA) vulnerability in Indico through 3.3.5 allows attackers to read information by sending a crafted POST request to the component /api/principals. NOTE this is disputed by the Supplier because the product intentionally lets all users retrieve certain information about other user accounts (this functionality is, in the current design, not restricted to any privileged roles such as event organizer).
