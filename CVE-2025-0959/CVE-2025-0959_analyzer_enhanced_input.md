# Vulnerability Description

    The Eventer - WordPress Event & Booking Manager Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the reg_id parameter in all versions up to, and including, 3.9.9.2 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.
