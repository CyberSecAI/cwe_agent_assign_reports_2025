# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-11167

## Vulnerability Description
An **improper access control** vulnerability in danny-avila/librechat versions prior to 0.7.6 allows authenticated users to delete other users prompts via the groupid parameter. This issue occurs because the endpoint does not verify whether the provided prompt ID belongs to the current user.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **improper access control**
- **impact:** delete other users prompts
- **attacker:** authenticated users
- **product:** danny-avila/librechat
- **version:** prior to 0.7.6

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2024-11167 Content

The provided content relates to a fix for an **invalid access control** issue in the LibreChat application.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stemmed from insufficient access control checks when deleting prompt groups. Specifically, the code did not properly restrict users from deleting prompt groups they did not own, or were not authorized to delete.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** Users could potentially delete prompt groups that did not belong to them, leading to unauthorized data deletion.
*   **Missing Authorization:** Lack of proper authorization checks allowed users to bypass intended restrictions.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Data Deletion:** Unauthorized users could delete prompt groups, potentially disrupting the application's functionality or causing data loss for other users.
*   **Privilege Escalation (Potential):** Depending on the role of the prompt groups, unauthorized deletion could potentially lead to further privilege escalation.

**Attack vectors:**

*   An authenticated user could manipulate requests to delete prompt groups they do not own. This could be done by modifying the `_id` or `groupId` parameters in the API request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An authenticated user with access to the LibreChat application.
*   Basic understanding of the API endpoints and request parameters.

**Mitigation or fix:**

The fix implemented the following changes:

*   **Added Author Check:** The `deletePromptGroup` function now includes a check to ensure that the user attempting to delete the group is either the author of the group or has the `ADMIN` role.
*   **Query Modification:** The query used to delete the prompt group is modified based on the user's role. If the user is an admin, the author check is removed from the query, allowing them to delete any group.
*   **API Route Update:** The API route for deleting prompt groups was updated to include the necessary authorization checks.

**More detail than official CVE description:**

Yes, the content provides significantly more detail than a typical CVE description. It includes specific code changes, explanations of the authorization logic, and details about the affected API endpoints.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control

**Authentication**:
Determines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.

* Example phrases: "user must log in", "lack of login check", "bypasses login"
* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.

  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* – used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).

**Authorization**:
Determines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do. It decides access *after* identity is verified.

* Example phrases: "unauthorized access", "regular user can access admin panel", "role checks are missing"
* CWE relevance: use CWEs like 862, 863, 285 for authorization errors:

  * **CWE-862**: *Missing Authorization* – the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all.
  * **CWE-863**: *Incorrect Authorization* – the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).
  * **CWE-285**: *Improper Authorization* – general category for any flawed authorization logic or design.

**Access Control**:
A broader term that includes both authentication and authorization. Governs how resources are protected and who can access them under what conditions.

* CWE relevance:

  * **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* – top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear.
  * This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.

## Mapping Discussion – Common Misclassification Patterns

### 1. **CWE-306 vs CWE-862**:

* **306** is about lack of **authentication** (e.g., *no login required at all*).
* **862** is about lack of **authorization** *after* authentication (e.g., *admin check missing*).
* ✅ Example CWE-306: *“An unauthenticated attacker can invoke the password reset API.”*
* ✅ Example CWE-862: *“An authenticated user without admin privileges can delete any user account.”*

### 2. **CWE-285 vs CWE-284**:

* **285** is specific to authorization flaws – it's a better choice than 284 **if** the issue involves *improper or missing role checks*.
* **284** should be reserved for general access control issues when it’s unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.

---

## Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification

**Phrase like "unauthorized access" is not enough.**

* If you **cannot determine whether identity was checked**, assume it’s **authorization** and consider 862 or 863.
* If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** → CWE-306.
* If the **access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced**, but it's not due to missing checks, consider **CWE-284**.

---

## Good Mapping Examples

* ✅ **CWE-306**: “The endpoint `/admin/deleteUser` does not require any authentication.”
* ✅ **CWE-862**: “Any logged-in user can change any other user's email without being an admin.”
* ✅ **CWE-863**: “An admin check exists but incorrectly grants access to non-admin users.”
* ✅ **CWE-285**: “Application uses a static role check that fails when roles change dynamically.”
* ✅ **CWE-284**: “Inconsistent enforcement of access rules across services with unclear policy source.”
