## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
CVE-2024-56525 - User-XML Fatal Vulnerabilities For OJS/OMP/OPS < 3.3.0.21

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the handling of User-XML data in versions of OJS/OMP/OPS prior to 3.3.0.21.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   The User-XML import tool allows attackers to create a user with Admin privileges.
*   An attacker with Admin privileges can upload malicious plugins (backdoors) to gain access to the server.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Compromise of the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of the platform.
*   Defacement of the journal site (redirection to phishing/gambling sites - "judi online").
*   Potential for full server access via malicious plugin upload.

**Attack vectors:**

1.  Login as a legitimate user (Journal Editor).
2.  Use the User-XML import tool to create a new user with Admin roles.
3.  Login as the newly created Admin user.
4.  Upload a malicious plugin (backdoor).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   Valid credentials for a user with access to the User-XML import tool (e.g., Journal Editor).
*   Ability to create a malicious User-XML file.
*   Ability to upload a plugin.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   Upgrade to OJS/OMP/OPS 3.3.0.21 or later.
*   Apply the patch available at: <https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/issues/10738>
*   Implement strong password policies.
*   Consider using Two-Factor Authentication (2FA).
*   Utilize security tools like Guardian AI and OJT Advanced Security (offered by Open Journal Theme).

**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**

*   The article details the steps taken by attackers to exploit the vulnerability, including log examples.
*   The author highlights the increasing targeting of academic journals by hackers.
*   The author promotes their company's security services (Guardian AI and OJT Advanced Security) as solutions to mitigate these threats.
*   The article mentions that Cloudflare alone is insufficient to protect against this specific vulnerability.
*   The author confirmed the vulnerability with the lead developer of the PKP platform (Alec).
