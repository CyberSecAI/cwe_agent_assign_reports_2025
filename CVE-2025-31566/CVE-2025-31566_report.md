## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with CWE-352, Cross-Site Request Forgery. Successful exploitation of the CSRF vulnerability leads to Stored XSS, CWE-79.

## Summary of Analysis
The vulnerability description and CVE reference link clearly state the presence of a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability that leads to Stored XSS. The evidence supports the classification of CWE-352 as the primary weakness and CWE-79 as a secondary weakness. The relationship analysis shows that the CSRF vulnerability can lead to XSS. The selection of these CWEs is based on the provided evidence.

**Supporting Evidence:**
*   **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases:** "rootcause: **cross-site request forgery**" and "weakness: **cross-site scripting, XSS**"
*   **CVE Reference Links Content Summary:** "The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)." and "A malicious actor could force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication."

CWE-79 is selected because the CSRF leads to Stored XSS within the application.

**CWEs Considered But Not Used:**

*   **CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')**: While SQL Injection is a common vulnerability, it is not mentioned in the provided vulnerability description or CVE reference. Therefore, it is not appropriate to assign this CWE.
*   **CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**: This CWE is not relevant as the description doesn't mention any server-side request forgery.
*   **CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type**: This CWE is not relevant because there is no mention of file uploads in the description.
*   **CWE-601: URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')**: This CWE is not relevant because there is no mention of URL redirection.
*   **CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output**: Although related to XSS, CWE-79 is more specific in this case.
*   **CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path**: This CWE is not relevant as the description doesn't mention file paths.
*   **CWE-1275: Sensitive Cookie with Improper SameSite Attribute**: This CWE could be a contributing factor to CSRF, but is not directly stated.
