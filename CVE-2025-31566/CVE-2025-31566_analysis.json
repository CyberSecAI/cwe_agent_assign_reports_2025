It provides details about a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the Rio Video Gallery WordPress plugin.\n\nHere's an extraction of the relevant information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). The content does not specify the exact root cause within the plugin's code.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n*   Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\nA malicious actor could force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact varies case by case.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\nThe attack vector is through Cross-Site Request Forgery.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n*   Unauthenticated attacker.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n*   Remove and replace the software, as it is likely abandoned and won't receive updates.\n*   Deactivating the software does not remove the threat unless a vPatch is deployed.\n*   Patchstack offers vPatching as a mitigation when no official patch is available.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n*   **Affected Software:** Rio Video Gallery WordPress Plugin\n*   **Vulnerable Versions:** <= 2.3.6\n*   **Fixed Version:** N/A (No official fix available)\n*   **CVSS Score:** 7.1 (Low severity)\n*   **OWASP Top 10:** A1: Broken Access Control\n*   **Reported by:** Abdi Pranata\n*   **Published by:** Patchstack\n*   **PSID:** 0fa395618af8\n\nThe content provides more detail than the placeholder CVE description, specifically identifying the affected plugin, vulnerable versions, and the researcher who reported the vulnerability. It also highlights the risk of using abandoned software.",
