  "query": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved scsi ufs core Set SDEV_OFFLINE when UFS is shut down There is a history of deadlock if reboot is performed at the beginning of booting. SDEV_QUIESCE was set for all LUs scsi_devices by UFS shutdown, and at that time the audio driver was waiting on blk_mq_submit_bio() holding a mutex_lock while reading the fw binary. After that, a deadlock issue occurred while audio driver shutdown was waiting for mutex_unlock of blk_mq_submit_bio(). To solve this, set SDEV_OFFLINE for all LUs except WLUN, so that any I/O that comes down after a UFS shutdown will return an error.
