## Query
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved scsi ufs core Set SDEV_OFFLINE when UFS is shut down There is a history of deadlock if reboot is performed at the beginning of booting. SDEV_QUIESCE was set for all LUs scsi_devices by UFS shutdown, and at that time the audio driver was waiting on blk_mq_submit_bio() holding a mutex_lock while reading the fw binary. After that, a deadlock issue occurred while audio driver shutdown was waiting for mutex_unlock of blk_mq_submit_bio(). To solve this, set SDEV_OFFLINE for all LUs except WLUN, so that any I/O that comes down after a UFS shutdown will return an error.

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: 'A deadlock occurs during system shutdown because the audio driver holds a mutex while waiting on I', 'O via blk_mq_submit_bio()', 'the UFS shutdown process attempts to acquire the same mutex after having set SDEV_QUIESCE for all LUs.'
- **weakness**: 'The UFS shutdown process did not properly handle ongoing I', 'O requests', 'specifically those initiated by other drivers like the audio driver. The SDEV_QUIESCE setting was not sufficient to prevent a deadlock.'
