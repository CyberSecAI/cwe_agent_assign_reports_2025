# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-50098

## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved scsi ufs core Set SDEV_OFFLINE when UFS is shut down There is a history of deadlock if reboot is performed at the beginning of booting. SDEV_QUIESCE was set for all LUs scsi_devices by UFS shutdown, and at that time the audio driver was waiting on blk_mq_submit_bio() holding a mutex_lock while reading the fw binary. After that, a deadlock issue occurred while audio driver shutdown was waiting for mutex_unlock of blk_mq_submit_bio(). To solve this, set SDEV_OFFLINE for all LUs except WLUN, so that any I/O that comes down after a UFS shutdown will return an error.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **A deadlock occurs during system shutdown because the audio driver holds a mutex while waiting on I/O via blk_mq_submit_bio(), and the UFS shutdown process attempts to acquire the same mutex after having set SDEV_QUIESCE for all LUs.**
- **weakness:** **The UFS shutdown process did not properly handle ongoing I/O requests, specifically those initiated by other drivers like the audio driver. The SDEV_QUIESCE setting was not sufficient to prevent a deadlock.**
- **impact:** System deadlock, causing the system to become unresponsive and require a hard reset.
- **vector:** The deadlock is triggered during system shutdown/reboot when both UFS and other drivers like audio are concurrently trying to access the same resource.
- **attacker:** Not applicable. This is not an exploitable vulnerability from an external attacker.
- **product:** Linux Kernel
- **version:** Not specified in the provided text
- **component:** scsi ufs core, audio driver

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content pertains to a fix for a deadlock issue in the Linux kernel's UFS (Universal Flash Storage) driver, and is relevant to the CVE description.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A deadlock could occur during reboot if the UFS shutdown process set `SDEV_QUIESCE` for all Logical Units (LUs) while another process (like an audio driver) was waiting on `blk_mq_submit_bio()` holding a mutex lock. This could lead to a deadlock when the audio driver shutdown waited for the mutex unlock.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The use of `scsi_device_quiesce` during UFS shutdown did not properly prevent new I/O operations from being initiated, which resulted in the deadlock scenario described above.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The system would become deadlocked during a reboot operation.
- The system would become unresponsive and require a hard reset.

**Attack vectors:**
- Triggering a system reboot while the UFS subsystem and other drivers (such as an audio driver) are active and performing I/O operations.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need to be in a position to trigger a reboot of the affected system.
- The attacker would need no special privileges.

**Technical Details**
- The fix replaces `scsi_device_quiesce(sdev)` with setting the device state to `SDEV_OFFLINE` using `scsi_device_set_state(sdev, SDEV_OFFLINE)` protected by a mutex. This ensures that any new I/O requests after UFS shutdown return an error, preventing the deadlock scenario. The write-once logical unit (WLUN) is excluded from this change.
- The commit messages include a kernel log showing the call trace leading to the deadlock.
