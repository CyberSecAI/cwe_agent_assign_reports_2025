# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-50098

## Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved scsi ufs core Set SDEV_OFFLINE when UFS is shut down There is a history of deadlock if reboot is performed at the beginning of booting. SDEV_QUIESCE was set for all LUs scsi_devices by UFS shutdown, and at that time the audio driver was waiting on blk_mq_submit_bio() holding a mutex_lock while reading the fw binary. After that, a deadlock issue occurred while audio driver shutdown was waiting for mutex_unlock of blk_mq_submit_bio(). To solve this, set SDEV_OFFLINE for all LUs except WLUN, so that any I/O that comes down after a UFS shutdown will return an error.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Rootcause:** A deadlock occurs during system shutdown because the audio driver holds a mutex while waiting on I/O via blk_mq_submit_bio(), and the UFS shutdown process attempts to acquire the same mutex after having set SDEV_QUIESCE for all LUs.
- **Weakness:** The UFS shutdown process did not properly handle ongoing I/O requests, specifically those initiated by other drivers like the audio driver. The SDEV_QUIESCE setting was not sufficient to prevent a deadlock.
- **Impact:** System deadlock, causing the system to become unresponsive and require a hard reset.
- **Vector:** The deadlock is triggered during system shutdown/reboot when both UFS and other drivers like audio are concurrently trying to access the same resource.
- **Attacker:** Not applicable. This is not an exploitable vulnerability from an external attacker.
- **Product:** Linux Kernel
- **Version:** Not specified in the provided text
- **Component:** scsi ufs core, audio driver

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-833 | Deadlock | 1.0 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-667 | Improper Locking | 0.7 | Class | Secondary | Allowed-with-Review |
| CWE-362 | Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') | 0.6 | Class | Secondary | Allowed-with-Review |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is a deadlock, CWE-833, which occurs due to **improper locking**, CWE-667, and **concurrent execution with improper synchronization**, CWE-362. CWE-833 is a base-level CWE, providing a specific description of the deadlock condition. CWE-667 and CWE-362 are class-level CWEs that describe the broader categories of locking and synchronization issues that contribute to the deadlock. The relationship is that the improper locking and concurrent execution lead to the deadlock. Choosing CWE-833 as primary because it is the specific outcome, and the other two are contributing factors.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **improper locking**, CWE-667, and **concurrent execution using a shared resource with improper synchronization**, CWE-362, which leads to the **deadlock**, CWE-833. The UFS shutdown process and the audio driver concurrently attempt to access the same resource (mutex), resulting in the system becoming unresponsive. The fix involves setting the device state to `SDEV_OFFLINE` to prevent new I/O requests, addressing the root cause of the deadlock.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis identified **CWE-833 (Deadlock)** as the primary vulnerability due to the system becoming unresponsive. The supporting evidence from the vulnerability description clearly indicates a deadlock situation. The **root cause** involves **improper locking** (CWE-667) and **concurrent execution with improper synchronization** (CWE-362). The retriever results also highlighted CWE-833 as a potential match. The relationship analysis confirmed that CWE-833 is the specific outcome of the locking and synchronization issues, making it the most appropriate primary CWE. The other CWEs considered, like CWE-782 and CWE-781 are IOCTL related and don't fit the rootcause description well.

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-833: Deadlock
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.80
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product contains multiple threads or executable segments that are waiting for each other to release a necessary lock, resulting in deadlock.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-667: Improper Locking
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-1285: Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input that is expected to specify an index, position, or offset into an indexable resource such as a buffer or file, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the specified index/position/offset has the required properties.
