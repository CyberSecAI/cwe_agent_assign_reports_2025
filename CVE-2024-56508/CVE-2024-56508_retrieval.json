Prior to 1.15.6, a **file upload vulnerability** exists in the LinkAce. This issue occurs in the Import Bookmarks functionality, where malicious HTML files can be uploaded containing JavaScript payloads. These payloads execute when the uploaded links are accessed, leading to potential reflected or persistent XSS scenarios. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.15.6.', key_phrases={'rootcause': '', 'weakness': ['file upload vulnerability', 'XSS vulnerability'], 'impact': 'execute malicious HTML files', 'vector': '', 'attacker': '', 'product': 'LinkAce', 'version': 'prior to 1.15.6', 'component': 'Import Bookmarks functionality'}, reference_content='Based on the provided information, here\\'s an analysis of CVE-2024-56508:\\n\\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\\nThe vulnerability stems from improper validation and sanitization of uploaded HTML files in the \"Import Bookmarks\" functionality of LinkAce. The application does not prevent the inclusion of malicious JavaScript within the HTML files that are uploaded.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\\n- **File Upload Vulnerability:**  The application allows the upload of HTML files without proper content inspection and sanitization.\\n- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The lack of sanitization allows for the injection of malicious JavaScript within uploaded HTML files.\\n\\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\\n- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim\\'s browser.\\n- **Session Hijacking:** Attackers can steal session cookies and potentially impersonate users.\\n- **Data Theft:** Malicious scripts can be used to steal sensitive information.\\n\\n**Attack Vectors:**\\n- **File Upload:** The attacker uploads a specially crafted HTML file containing malicious JavaScript.\\n- **Reflected or Persistent XSS:** The injected JavaScript is executed when a user accesses the imported links.\\n\\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\\n- **Low Privilege:** The attacker needs to have a low-privileged account in LinkAce.\\n- **User Interaction:** The victim needs to access the imported links for the malicious JavaScript to execute.\\n- **Network access**: The attacker needs to access the application through the network.\\n\\n**Additional Details:**\\n- The vulnerability is present in LinkAce versions prior to v1.15.6.\\n- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates how to embed a simple JavaScript alert in the HTML file.\\n- The CVSS v3 base score is 7.6, indicating a high severity vulnerability. The CVSS vector is CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:N\\n- CWE-434 is listed as a weakness, which refers to Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type.\\n- The commit diffs show changes to `app/Actions/ImportHtmlBookmarks.php` and tests.', similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {}, 'top_cwes_by_threshold': {}}}, similarity_summary=SimilarityInsight(consensus_cwe='', top_cwes=[], confidence_levels={}, total_samples=0), analysis='', analysis_with_relationships='', criticism='', resolution='', relevant_cwes=[{'metadata': {'doc_id': '434', 'name': 'Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'weakness:file upload vulnerability', 'keyphrase': 'file upload vulnerability', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'weakness:XSS vulnerability', 'keyphrase': 'XSS vulnerability', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'impact:execute malicious HTML files', 'keyphrase': 'execute malicious HTML files', 'type': 'impact'}, {'id': 'product:LinkAce', 'keyphrase': 'LinkAce', 'type': 'product'}, {'id': 'version:prior to 1.15.6', 'keyphrase': 'prior to 1.15.6', 'type': 'version'}, {'id': 'component:Import Bookmarks functionality', 'keyphrase': 'Import Bookmarks functionality', 'type': 'component'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(395.5865278100441)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '79', 'name': \"Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\", 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'weakness:file upload vulnerability', 'keyphrase': 'file upload vulnerability', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'weakness:XSS vulnerability', 'keyphrase': 'XSS vulnerability', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'impact:execute malicious HTML files', 'keyphrase': 'execute malicious HTML files', 'type': 'impact'}, {'id': 'product:LinkAce', 'keyphrase': 'LinkAce', 'type': 'product'}, {'id': 'version:prior to 1.15.6', 'keyphrase': 'prior to 1.15.6', 'type': 'version'}, {'id': 'component:Import Bookmarks functionality', 'keyphrase': 'Import Bookmarks functionality', 'type': 'component'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(368.3629114835907)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '116', 'name': 'Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
