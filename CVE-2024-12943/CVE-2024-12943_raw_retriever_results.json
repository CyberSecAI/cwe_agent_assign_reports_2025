Affected by this vulnerability is an unknown functionality of the file /ownersignup.php. The manipulation of the argument f/e/p/m/o/n/c/s/ci/a leads to sql injection. The attack can be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The initial researcher advisory only mentions the parameter m to be affected. But it must be assumed that many other parameters are affected as well.",
