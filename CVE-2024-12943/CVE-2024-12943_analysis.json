  "description": "A vulnerability was found in CodeAstro House Rental Management System 1.0. It has been declared as critical. Affected by this vulnerability is an unknown functionality of the file /ownersignup.php. The manipulation of the argument f/e/p/m/o/n/c/s/ci/a leads to **sql injection**. The attack can be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The initial researcher advisory only mentions the parameter m to be affected. But it must be assumed that many other parameters are affected as well.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-12943 (based on the GitHub issue title and description)\n\n**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation and sanitization of the `m` parameter in the `ownersignup.php` file of the \"House Rental Management System in PHP with Source Code\" v1.0. This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code directly into SQL queries without any prior cleaning or validation.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection, specifically a time-based blind SQL injection. The application directly uses user-supplied input in an SQL query, making it vulnerable to manipulation.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n*   **Unauthorized database access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database.\n*   **Sensitive data leakage:** Attackers can access and steal sensitive information stored in the database.\n*   **Data tampering:** Attackers can modify or delete data within the database.\n*   **System control:** Attackers could potentially gain comprehensive control over the system through database manipulation.\n*   **Service interruption:** Attackers could cause service disruption.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to the `ownersignup.php` file, specifically by manipulating the `m` parameter.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n*   The attacker does not need to be logged into the application to exploit the vulnerability.\n*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.\n*   The attacker does not require any special privileges or access to the system besides network access.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n*   The vulnerability is present in version 1.0 of the \"House Rental Management System in PHP with Source Code\" project.\n*   The vulnerable file is `ownersignup.php`.\n*   The GitHub issue provides a Proof of Concept (POC) exploit using a modified GET request and shows the use of sqlmap to identify the vulnerability as time-based blind SQL injection.\n*   The suggested remediation steps are provided in the GitHub description as well.\n* The vulnerability is in code from codeastro.com",

The application fails to neutralize special elements in SQL commands, leading to SQL injection. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship to consider is that CWE-89 is a Base level CWE, which is appropriate for direct mapping as it represents the root cause of the **SQL Injection** vulnerability. Other CWEs, such as CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')), are more abstract (Class) and less suitable for directly mapping the root cause. The vulnerability description explicitly indicates **SQL Injection**, making CWE-89 the most specific and accurate choice.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n\n    cwe89 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe89 primary\n    class cwe74 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward:\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Improper Neutralization** of SQL Special Elements (CWE-89). The application fails to sanitize user input used in SQL queries.\n2.  **Impact:** **SQL Injection**. An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code, leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the explicit description of an **SQL Injection** vulnerability in the CodeAstro House Rental Management System 1.0. The vulnerability occurs due to **improper neutralization** of special elements within SQL commands, specifically through manipulation of the `m` parameter in the `/ownersignup.php` file.\n\nThe evidence supporting this assessment is strong, as indicated by the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\": \"The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation and sanitization of the `m` parameter...
