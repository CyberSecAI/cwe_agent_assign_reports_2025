# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |

| CWE-121 | Stack-based Buffer Overflow | 1.0 | Variant | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 0.5 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship influencing the selection is the hierarchical relationship between CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) and its variants, CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow) and CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write). Since the vulnerability description explicitly mentions a **stack overflow**, CWE-121 is chosen as the primary CWE. CWE-787 is a more general case of writing beyond buffer boundaries, and while potentially applicable, it is less specific than CWE-121 given the context.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **stack overflow** (CWE-121) due to the `apmode_dns1_pri` and `apmode_dns1_sec` parameters in `wlg_adv.cgi`. This leads to a Denial of Service (DoS). Thus, the root cause is CWE-121, and the impact is DoS.

## Summary of Analysis
The primary indicator is the phrase "**stack overflow** vulnerabilities". This directly suggests CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow). The vulnerability occurs in the `wlg_adv.cgi` component, triggered by crafted POST requests using the `apmode_dns1_pri` and `apmode_dns1_sec` parameters. The impact is a Denial of Service (DoS).

The Retriever Results also lists CWE-121 as the top candidate with a score of 1.0.

CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) was considered as a secondary CWE because a stack overflow inherently involves writing beyond the allocated buffer. However, CWE-121 is more precise due to the explicit mention of "stack".

CWE-120 (Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')) was not selected because the vulnerability description doesn't explicitly state that a buffer copy operation is the root cause. Similarly, CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) was not selected, as the problem is writing beyond the bounds, not reading. Integer overflows were also in the retriever results, but not applicable since there is no evidence of integer overflows causing a **stack overflow**.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of a command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended command when it is sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: CWE-77 is often misused when OS command injection (CWE-78) was intended instead [REF-1287].



## CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A stack-based buffer overflow condition is a condition where the buffer being overwritten is allocated on the stack (i.e., is a local variable or, rarely, a parameter to a function).

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-790: Improper Filtering of Special Elements
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives data from an upstream component, but does not filter or incorrectly filters special elements before sending it to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product requires authentication, but the product has an alternate path or channel that does not require authentication.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-912: Hidden Functionality
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product contains functionality that is not documented, not part of the specification, and not accessible through an interface or command sequence that is obvious to the product's users or administrators.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-134: Use of Externally-Controlled Format String
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a function that accepts a format string as an argument, but the format string originates from an external source.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70

## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 599.73
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product performs a calculation that can
         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic
         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than
         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is
         incremented to a value that is too large to store in the
         associated representation. When this occurs
