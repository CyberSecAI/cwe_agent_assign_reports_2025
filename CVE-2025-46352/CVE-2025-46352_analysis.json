CWE-259 is a more specific variant of CWE-798, but the description does not explicitly state that the **hard-coded credential** is a password. Therefore, CWE-798 is the more appropriate primary mapping, with CWE-259 as a secondary consideration.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    cwe259[\"CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password\"]\n    \n    cwe259 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe798 primary\n    class cwe259 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **hard-coded password**, which leads to unauthorized access to the fire panel, potentially resulting in a non-functional state and serious safety issues.\n\nRoot Cause: CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials)\nImpact: Unauthorized Access, Potential System Failure\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-798 as the primary candidate due to the **hard-coded password**. The retriever results also suggested CWE-259, a more specific variant, which was considered. Ultimately, CWE-798 was chosen as the primary CWE because the description specifies a hard-coded credential without explicitly stating it's a password. However, due to the context, CWE-259 is a strong secondary candidate.\n\nThe decision is based on the evidence: \"**hard-coded password** that runs on a VNC server and is visible as a string in the binary responsible for running VNC. This password cannot be altered, allowing anyone with knowledge of it to gain remote access to the panel.\"\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the decision by highlighting the parent-child relationship between CWE-798 and CWE-259, aiding in selecting the most appropriate level of specificity. CWE-798 is the most appropriate level of specificity, as it captures the general case of **hard-coded credentials**, while CWE-259 is a more specific case.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced
