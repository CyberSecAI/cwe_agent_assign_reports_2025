  "query": "The CS5000 Fire Panel is vulnerable due to a hard-coded password that runs on a VNC server and is visible as a string in the binary responsible for running VNC. This password cannot be altered, allowing anyone with knowledge of it to gain remote access to the panel. Such access could enable an attacker to operate the panel remotely, potentially putting the fire panel into a non-functional state and causing serious safety issues.",
