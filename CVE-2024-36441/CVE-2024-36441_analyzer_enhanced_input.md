## Vulnerability Description
Swissphone DiCal-RED 4009 devices allow an unauthenticated attacker use a port-2101 TCP connection to gain access to operation messages that are received by the device.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** access operation messages
- **vector:** port-2101 TCP connection
- **attacker:** unauthenticated attacker
- **product:** Swissphone DiCal-RED 4009

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The DiCal-RED device has a network service on TCP port 2101 that sends sensitive data without any authentication checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Missing Authentication:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of authentication for the network service running on TCP port 2101. This allows any client to connect and receive data.
- **Information Exposure:** The service transmits sensitive information such as operation messages, potentially including emergency situations and vehicle positions/routes. This constitutes an exposure of sensitive data. (CWE-200)

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated attacker can connect to the device and passively obtain sensitive information about ongoing emergency situations, vehicle positions, and routes.
- This information could be used to track emergency responders, gain insights into operational procedures, and potentially for malicious purposes (e.g., targeting emergency vehicles, interfering with response efforts etc).

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based.
- An attacker only needs network connectivity to the device running the vulnerable service on TCP port 2101.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the DiCal-RED device. This could be within the same local network or through any network that the device is connected to.
- No specific technical expertise is required beyond basic network connectivity and the ability to connect to a TCP port. `telnet` was used in the PoC.

**Additional notes:**
- The manufacturer has declared the product EOL (End of Life), which means that a fix is unlikely.
- The manufacturer recommends not running the device on untrusted networks, but this is a mitigation, not a proper solution to the vulnerability.
