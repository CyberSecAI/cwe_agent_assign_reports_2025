  "query": "A vulnerability has been found in Union Bank of India Vyom 8.0.34 on Android and classified as problematic. This vulnerability affects unknown code of the component Rooting Detection. The manipulation leads to protection mechanism failure. The attack needs to be approached locally. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation appears to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",
