  "description": "An **integer overflow** vulnerability exists in the Compound Document Binary File format parser of v1.14.52 of the GNOME Project G Structured File Library (libgsf). A specially crafted file can result in an **integer overflow** that allows for a **heap-based buffer overflow** when processing the sector allocation table. This can lead to arbitrary code execution. An attacker can provide a malicious file to trigger this vulnerability.",

  "reference_content": "The provided content is related to CVE-2024-42415.\n\n**Root Cause:**\n- An integer overflow occurs when calculating the size of the sector allocation table in the `ole_init_info` function. This calculation multiplies the number of sectors by the sector size divided by the size of a single entry. Due to the use of a 32-bit integer, the result can overflow, leading to an undersized allocation.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n- **Integer Overflow:** The multiplication used to determine the allocation size for the file allocation table can overflow.\n- **Heap-based Buffer Overflow:** The undersized buffer allocated for the file allocation table is later overflowed when the file allocation table entries are copied into it by `ole_info_read_metabat`.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- Arbitrary code execution due to heap-based buffer overflow\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- A specially crafted compound document binary file can trigger the vulnerability.\n- The file needs to have a large sector size and a large number of sectors in the file allocation table to cause the integer overflow.\n- The vulnerability can be triggered by applications using `libgsf` to parse a malicious file, such as the `tracker-miners` service, which automatically indexes and parses files in user's home directory.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious file to a vulnerable application using `libgsf`.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n- The vulnerability is located in the `gsf_infile_msole.c` file of the `libgsf` library, specifically in the `ole_init_info` and `ole_info_read_metabat` functions.\n- The vulnerability affects libgsf version 1.14.52 and commit 634340d31177c02ccdb43171e37291948e7f8974.\n- The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.14.53.\n- The provided crash information includes a GDB debugging session demonstrating the integer overflow and subsequent crash.\n- A proof-of-concept python script is mentioned which can be used to generate malicious files. The script is not provided but details about the structure of the malformed file are given.",

CWE-190 is a base CWE, which is the preferred level of abstraction. CWE-122 is a base CWE, which is the preferred level of abstraction. The relationship between these two is that an integer overflow can precede a heap-based buffer overflow.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe190[\"CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\"]\n    cwe122[\"CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n\n    cwe190 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe122\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe190 primary\n    class cwe122 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **integer overflow** (CWE-190), which occurs during the processing of the sector allocation table.
