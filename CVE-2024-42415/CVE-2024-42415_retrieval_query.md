# Retrieval Query for CVE-2024-42415

# Vulnerability Description

    An **integer overflow** vulnerability exists in the Compound Document Binary File format parser of v1.14.52 of the GNOME Project G Structured File Library (libgsf). A specially crafted file can result in an **integer overflow** that allows for a **heap-based buffer overflow** when processing the sector allocation table. This can lead to arbitrary code execution. An attacker can provide a malicious file to trigger this vulnerability.

    ## WEAKNESS: 'integer overflow'

Relevant CWEs for this WEAKNESS:

### 1. CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound (Score: 567.95)

The product performs a calculation that can
         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic
         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than
         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is
         incremented to a value that is too large to st...

### 2. CWE-197: Numeric Truncation Error (Score: 512.06)

Truncation errors occur when a primitive is cast to a primitive of a smaller size and data is lost in the conversion....

### 3. CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow (Score: 471.43)

A heap overflow condition is a buffer overflow, where the buffer that can be overwritten is allocated in the heap portion of memory, generally meaning that the buffer was allocated using a routine such as malloc()....

### 4. CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input (Score: 463.75)
