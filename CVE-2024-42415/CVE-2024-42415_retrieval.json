A specially crafted file can result in an **integer overflow** that allows for a **heap-based buffer overflow** when processing the sector allocation table. This can lead to arbitrary code execution. An attacker can provide a malicious file to trigger this vulnerability.', key_phrases={'rootcause': '', 'weakness': ['integer overflow', 'heap-based buffer overflow'], 'impact': 'arbitrary code execution', 'vector': 'specially crafted file', 'attacker': '', 'product': 'GNOME Project G Structured File Library (libgsf)', 'version': 'v1.14.52', 'component': 'Compound Document Binary File format parser'}, reference_content=\"The provided content is related to CVE-2024-42415.\\n\\n**Root Cause:**\\n- An integer overflow occurs when calculating the size of the sector allocation table in the `ole_init_info` function. This calculation multiplies the number of sectors by the sector size divided by the size of a single entry. Due to the use of a 32-bit integer, the result can overflow, leading to an undersized allocation.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\\n- **Integer Overflow:** The multiplication used to determine the allocation size for the file allocation table can overflow.\\n- **Heap-based Buffer Overflow:** The undersized buffer allocated for the file allocation table is later overflowed when the file allocation table entries are copied into it by `ole_info_read_metabat`.\\n\\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\\n- Arbitrary code execution due to heap-based buffer overflow\\n\\n**Attack Vectors:**\\n- A specially crafted compound document binary file can trigger the vulnerability.\\n- The file needs to have a large sector size and a large number of sectors in the file allocation table to cause the integer overflow.\\n- The vulnerability can be triggered by applications using `libgsf` to parse a malicious file, such as the `tracker-miners` service, which automatically indexes and parses files in user's home directory.\\n\\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\\n- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious file to a vulnerable application using `libgsf`.\\n\\n**Additional Details:**\\n- The vulnerability is located in the `gsf_infile_msole.c` file of the `libgsf` library, specifically in the `ole_init_info` and `ole_info_read_metabat` functions.\\n- The vulnerability affects libgsf version 1.14.52 and commit 634340d31177c02ccdb43171e37291948e7f8974.\\n- The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.14.53.\\n- The provided crash information includes a GDB debugging session demonstrating the integer overflow and subsequent crash.\\n- A proof-of-concept python script is mentioned which can be used to generate malicious files. The script is not provided but details about the structure of the malformed file are given.\", similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {}, 'top_cwes_by_threshold': {}}}, similarity_summary=SimilarityInsight(consensus_cwe='', top_cwes=[], confidence_levels={}, total_samples=0), analysis='', analysis_with_relationships='', criticism='', resolution='', relevant_cwes=[{'metadata': {'doc_id': '190', 'name': 'Integer Overflow or Wraparound', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product performs a calculation that can\\n         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic\\n         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than\\n         the original value.
