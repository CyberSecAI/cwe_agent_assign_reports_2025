## Query
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved netfilter IDLETIMER Fix for possible ABBA deadlock Deletion of the last rule referencing a given idletimer may happen at the same time as a read of its file in sysfs | ====================================================== | WARNING possible circular locking dependency detected | 6.12.0-rc7-01692-g5e9a28f41134-dirty #594 Not tainted | ------------------------------------------------------ | iptables/3303 is trying to acquire lock | ffff8881057e04b8 (kn->active#48){++++}-{00}, at __kernfs_remove+0x20 | | but task is already holding lock | ffffffffa0249068 (list_mutex){+.+.}-{33}, at idletimer_tg_destroy_v] | | which lock already depends on the new lock. A simple reproducer is | #!/bin/bash | | while true do | iptables -A INPUT -i foo -j IDLETIMER --timeout 10 --label testme | iptables -D INPUT -i foo -j IDLETIMER --timeout 10 --label testme | done & | while true do | cat /sys/class/xt_idletimer/timers/testme >/dev/null | done Avoid this by freeing list_mutex right after deleting the element from the list, then continuing with the teardown.

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: 'circular locking dependency', 'deletion of the last rule referencing a given idletimer may happen at the same time as a read of its file in sysfs'
