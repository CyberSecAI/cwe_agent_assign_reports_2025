# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-25132
## Query
A flaw was found in the Hive hibernation controller component of OpenShift Dedicated. The ClusterDeployment.hive.openshift.io/v1 resource can be created with the spec.installed field set to true, regardless of the installation status, and a positive timespan for the spec.hibernateAfter value. If a ClusterSync.hiveinternal.openshift.io/v1alpha1 resource is also created, the hive hibernation controller will enter the reconciliation loop leading to a panic when accessing a non-existing field in the ClusterDeployments status section, resulting in a denial of service.

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: 'accessing a non-existing field in the ClusterDeployments status section'
