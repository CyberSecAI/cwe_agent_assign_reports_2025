  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-4548 Content\n\nBased on the provided content, this relates to a SQL injection vulnerability in campcodes Online Food Ordering System V1.0. The CVE description is missing, but the content provides more detail than a standard CVE description would.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability is due to insufficient user input validation of the 'username' parameter in the `/routers/router.php` file. Malicious code injected into this parameter is directly used in SQL queries without proper cleaning or validation.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   SQL Injection\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   Unauthorized database access\n*   Sensitive data leakage\n*   Data tampering\n*   System control\n*   Service interruption\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   The vulnerability is exploitable via the `username` parameter in a POST request to `/routers/router.php`.\n*   No login or authorization is required.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   An attacker needs to be able to send a crafted POST request to the vulnerable endpoint. No authentication is required.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   Use prepared statements and parameter binding.\n*   Input validation and filtering.\n*   Minimize database user permissions.\n*   Regular security audits.\n\n**Payload Example:**\n\n```\nParameter: username (POST)\n    Type: time-based blind\n    Title: MySQL >= 5.0.12 AND time-based blind (query SLEEP)\n    Payload: username=admin' AND (SELECT 3317 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))aSNJ)-- weAp&password=admin\n```\n\n**Software Link:**\n\n*   <https://www.campcodes.com/downloads/online-food-ordering-system-using-php-mysqli/?wpdmdl=5818&ind=0>",
