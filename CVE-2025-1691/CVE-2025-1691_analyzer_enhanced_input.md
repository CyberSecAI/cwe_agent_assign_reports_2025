## Vulnerability Description
The MongoDB Shell may be susceptible to **control character injection** where an attacker with control of the mongosh autocomplete feature, can use the autocompletion feature to input and run obfuscated malicious text. This requires user interaction in the form of the user using tab to autocomplete text that is a prefix of the attackers prepared autocompletion. This issue affects mongosh versions prior to 2.3.9. The vulnerability is exploitable only when mongosh is connected to a cluster that is partially or fully controlled by an attacker.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **control character injection**
- **impact:** input and run obfuscated malicious text
- **attacker:** attacker with control of mongosh autocomplete feature
- **product:** MongoDB Shell
- **version:** prior to 2.3.9

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary

*   The vulnerability is triggered when a user uses the ‘tab’ key to autocomplete text that is a prefix of the attacker’s prepared autocompletion.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker must have control of the `mongosh` autocomplete feature.
*   The attacker must be able to connect to a cluster that is partially or fully controlled by them.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   Upgrade to `mongosh` version 2.3.9 or later.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Type:** Bug
*   **Resolution:** Fixed
*   **Priority:** Major (P3)
*   **Affects Version/s:** `mongosh` versions prior to 2.3.9
*   **Required Configuration:** The vulnerability is exploitable only when `mongosh` is connected to a cluster that is partially or fully controlled by an attacker.
