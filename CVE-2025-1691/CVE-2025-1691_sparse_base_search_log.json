This requires user interaction in the form of the user using tab to autocomplete text that is a prefix of the attackers prepared autocompletion. This issue affects mongosh versions prior to 2.3.9. The vulnerability is exploitable only when mongosh is connected to a cluster that is partially or fully controlled by an attacker.",
