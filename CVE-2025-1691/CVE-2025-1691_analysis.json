  "description": "The MongoDB Shell may be susceptible to **control character injection** where an attacker with control of the mongosh autocomplete feature, can use the autocompletion feature to input and run obfuscated malicious text. This requires user interaction in the form of the user using tab to autocomplete text that is a prefix of the attackers prepared autocompletion. This issue affects mongosh versions prior to 2.3.9. The vulnerability is exploitable only when mongosh is connected to a cluster that is partially or fully controlled by an attacker.",

A more specific variant CWE considered was CWE-150, which deals with improper neutralization of escape, meta, or control sequences. CWE-150 is a child of CWE-138 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements), which is a broader class. CWE-74 is a parent of CWE-78 (OS Command Injection) and CWE-89 (SQL Injection), but those are not appropriate here.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    cwe138[\"CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\"]\n    cwe150[\"CWE-150: Improper Neutralization of Escape, Meta, or Control Sequences\"]\n\n    cwe150 -->|CHILDOF| cwe138\n    cwe138 -->|IMPLIED_CHILDOF| cwe74\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe74 primary\n    class cwe150 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the attacker controlling the `mongosh` autocomplete feature and preparing malicious autocompletion data. The user then triggers the vulnerability by using the 'tab' key. This leads to the injection of **control characters** into the `mongosh` shell, allowing the attacker to run obfuscated malicious text.\n  - Root cause: Improper handling of **control characters** in the autocompletion feature, leading to injection.\n  - Impact: Execution of obfuscated malicious text.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is the **control character injection** facilitated by the autocomplete feature in `mongosh`. The vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary indicate that an attacker can inject malicious text through the autocomplete feature, leading to the execution of arbitrary commands.\n\nThe CVE Reference Links Content Summary explicitly mentions CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')).\n> Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:\n> *   CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n> *   Control Character Injection\n\nWhile the ideal mapping would be to a more specific CWE related to **control character injection**, CWE-74 is the closest match given the information available. CWE-150 is also considered a valid candidate since the vulnerability description mentions the ability to inject and run obfuscated malicious text by leveraging **control characters** which are not properly neutralized.\n\n# Relevant CWE Information:\n\n## CWE-88: Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs a string for a command to be executed by a separate component\nin another control sphere, but it does not properly delimit the\nintended arguments, options, or switches within that command string.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Analysis**:\nCWE-88 is about argument injection, but this vulnerability is more general, where it can inject arbitrary malicious text through autocompletion.\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Analysis**:\nCWE-80 is for XSS, which is not relevant here.\n\n## CWE-93: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses CRLF (carriage return line feeds) as a special element, e.g. to separate lines or records, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CRLF sequences from inputs.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Analysis**:\nCWE-93 is for CRLF injection, which is not relevant here.\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
