The server fails to handle excessive characters appended to the end of multipart boundaries, regardless of the character used. This flaw can be exploited by sending malformed multipart requests with arbitrary characters at the end of the boundary, leading to excessive resource consumption and a complete denial of service for all users. The vulnerability is unauthenticated, meaning no user login or interaction is required for an attacker to exploit this issue. Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-789 CWE-1284 CWE-401 CWE-770 CWE-1333 CWE-400 CWE-130",
