## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability in szad670401/hyperlpr v3.0 allows for a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. The server **fails to handle excessive characters appended to the end of multipart boundaries**, regardless of the character used. This flaw can be exploited by sending malformed multipart requests with arbitrary characters at the end of the boundary, leading to excessive resource consumption and a complete denial of service for all users. The vulnerability is unauthenticated, meaning no user login or interaction is required for an attacker to exploit this issue.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **fails to handle excessive characters appended to the end of multipart boundaries**
- **impact:** resource consumption and Denial of Service
- **vector:** sending malformed multipart requests
