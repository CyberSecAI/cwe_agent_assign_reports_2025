  "vulnerability_info": "VulnerabilityInfo(cve_id='CVE-2025-30648', description='An Improper **Input Validation vulnerability** in the Juniper DHCP Daemon (jdhcpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause the jdhcpd process to crash resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). When a specifically malformed DHCP packet is received from a DHCP client, the jdhcpd process crashes, which will lead to the unavailability of the DHCP service and thereby resulting in a sustained DoS. The DHCP process will restart automatically to recover the service. This issue will occur when dhcp-security is enabled. This issue affects Junos OS * All versions before 21.2R3-S9, * from 21.4 before 21.4R3-S10, * from 22.2 before 22.2R3-S6, * from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S6, * from 23.2 before 23.2R2-S3, * from 23.4 before

When a specifically malformed DHCP packet is received from a DHCP client, the jdhcpd process crashes, which will lead to the unavailability of the DHCP service and thereby resulting in a sustained DoS. The DHCP process will restart automatically to recover the service. This issue will occur when dhcp-security is enabled. This issue affects Junos OS * All versions before 21.2R3-S9, * from 21.4 before 21.4R3-S10, * from 22.2 before 22.2R3-S6, * from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S6, * from 23.2 before 23.2R2-S3, * from 23.4 before 23.4R2-S4, * from 24.2 before 24.2R2 Junos OS Evolved * from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S6-EVO, * from 23.2 before 23.2R2-S3-EVO, * from 23.4 before 23.4R2-S4-EVO, * from 24.2 before 24.2R2-EVO. .\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'Input Validation vulnerability'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1.
