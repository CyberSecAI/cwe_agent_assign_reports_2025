# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-27161

## Vulnerability Description
all the Toshiba printers have programs containing a **hardcoded key used to encrypt files**. An attacker can decrypt the encrypted files using the hardcoded key. Insecure algorithm is used for the encryption. This vulnerability can be executed in combination with other vulnerabilities and difficult to execute alone. So, the CVSS score for this vulnerability alone is lower than the score listed in the Base Score of this vulnerability.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **hardcoded key used to encrypt files**
- **impact:** decrypt the encrypted files
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** Toshiba printers

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-27161:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance**
   - The provided content from Toshiba, JVN, and seclists.org, confirms that CVE-2024-27161 is a valid vulnerability affecting Toshiba multi-function printers. This CVE is specifically identified as a "Use of Hard-coded Credentials (CWE-798)".

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability**
   - The root cause of CVE-2024-27161 is the presence of hardcoded credentials within the firmware of Toshiba multi-function printers. Specifically, the authentication information between internal programs of the multi-function device is directly written into the program.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**
   - The primary vulnerability is the usage of hardcoded credentials (CWE-798).
   - This leads to an authentication bypass, as an attacker with access to the device may be able to reuse these credentials

**4. Impact of Exploitation**
   - **Information Theft:** An attacker with access to the multi-function device can steal sensitive information by exploiting the hardcoded credentials, potentially compromising the confidentiality of the printer's data.
   - The document does not mention other impacts (e.g., modification or destruction of data).

**5. Attack Vectors**
   - The attack vector is local or remote access to the multi-function printer. The attacker must be able to interact with the device via its network interfaces or through direct physical access.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**
   - The attacker needs access to the affected device's internal communication channels or programs, which could be achieved through:
     - Network access to the device.
     - Physical access to the device (for instance, if the device is compromised through another vulnerability.)
   - No administrative access to the web management interface is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes**

- This CVE is part of a larger set of vulnerabilities affecting Toshiba MFPs, as highlighted in the advisories.
- The vulnerability is categorized under the CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials).
- Mitigation involves updating the firmware of the affected devices.
- This vulnerability does not directly lead to remote code execution, but rather aids in accessing information from within the device.
- The report from seclists.org provides additional details about the wide range of vulnerabilities and their impacts, including more details on the specific attacks made possible by the weak credentials.
