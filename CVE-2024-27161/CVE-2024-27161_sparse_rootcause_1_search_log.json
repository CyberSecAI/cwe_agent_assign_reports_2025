  "query": "all the Toshiba printers have programs containing a hardcoded key used to encrypt files. An attacker can decrypt the encrypted files using the hardcoded key. Insecure algorithm is used for the encryption. This vulnerability can be executed in combination with other vulnerabilities and difficult to execute alone. So, the CVSS score for this vulnerability alone is lower than the score listed in the Base Score of this vulnerability.
