The `http_curl()` function directly retrieves the URL request response content without sufficient validation. |\n| CWE-200 | Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Sent Data | 0.6 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary Candidate. The vulnerability results in sensitive information being obtained. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.75\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship that impacted my decision was the parent-child relationship of CWE-918 and CWE-200. CWE-918 is the root cause, leading to the impact of CWE-200. CWE-918 describes the **improper** handling of URL requests, while CWE-200 describes the resulting exposure of sensitive information. The base level of CWE-918 is appropriate as it directly reflects the **root cause** of the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe918[\"CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Sent Data\"]\n\n    cwe200 -->|RESULT OF| cwe918\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe918 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the `http_curl()` function that is used to retrieve the content from a URL without proper validation (CWE-918). This leads to the exposure of sensitive information (CWE-200).\n- **Root Cause:** CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) - The `http_curl()` function is used to retrieve URL content without proper validation.\n- **Impact:** CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Sent Data - Retrieving arbitrary URLs can expose sensitive information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-918 as the primary weakness because the core issue is the **improper** handling of URL requests. The `http_curl()` function retrieves the content of any URL provided to it. The resulting conclusion is that CWE-918 is the correct primary CWE, as it represents the **root cause** of the vulnerability, where as CWE-200 is the impact of the vulnerability.\n\nThe evidence from the vulnerability description is: \"an issue in QiboSoft QiboCMS X1.0 allows a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information via the http_curl() function in the /application/common. php file that directly retrieves the URL request response content.\"\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the final selection by illustrating how the Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) leads to information exposure.\n\nCWE-918 is at the optimal level of specificity as it accurately captures the **root cause** of the vulnerability, which is the lack of validation when retrieving content from a URL.\n\n**CWEs Considered But Not Used:**\n\n*   **CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting'):** This was considered because it involves improper neutralization, but the vulnerability is not directly related to web page generation or cross-site scripting.\n*   **CWE-209 Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information:** This was considered because sensitive information is obtained, but the vulnerability is not directly related to the generation of error messages.\n*   **CWE-425 Direct Request ('Forced Browsing'):** This was considered because the application is making a direct request, but the main issue is the lack of validation of the request, not simply the direct request itself.\n*   **CWE-89 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection'):** This was considered because it involves improper neutralization, but the vulnerability is not directly related to SQL commands or SQL injection.\n*   **CWE-23 Relative Path Traversal:** This was not selected as it is about file paths, and not URL requests.\n*   **CWE-639 Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key:** This was not selected as it is related to authorization and keys and not URL requests.\n*   **CWE-598 Use of GET Request Method With Sensitive Query Strings:** The description does not specifically discuss query strings.\n*   **CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection'):** This was not selected as it is about code injection, and not URL requests.",
