## Analysis of CVE-2025-3176 Content

The provided content **RELATES** to a SQL injection vulnerability. It provides significantly more detail than a typical CVE description.

Here's a breakdown of the extracted information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   A SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `/single_lawyer.php` file of the "Time Table Generator" project.
*   The root cause is the direct use of the `u_id` parameter in SQL queries without proper sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   SQL Injection

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Unauthorized database access.
*   Sensitive data leakage.
*   Data tampering.
*   Comprehensive system control.
*   Service interruption.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The `u_id` parameter in a GET request to `/single_lawyer.php?u_id=1` is vulnerable.
*   Exploitation does not require login or authorization.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
*   No authentication is required.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   **Use prepared statements and parameter binding:** This separates SQL code from user input.
*   **Input validation and filtering:**  Ensure user input conforms to expected formats.
*   **Minimize database user permissions:** Use accounts with the least necessary privileges.
*   **Regular security audits:** Conduct frequent code and system security reviews.

**Payload Examples (provided for testing):**

*   Boolean-based blind SQL injection: `u_id=1' OR NOT 6837=6837-- SQJg`
*   Error-based SQL injection: `u_id=1' OR (SELECT 7955 FROM(SELECT COUNT(*),CONCAT(0x7176787171,(SELECT (ELT(7955=7955,1))),0x716b6a7871,FLOOR(RAND(0)*2))x FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PLUGINS GROUP BY x)a)-- uZey`
*   Time-based blind SQL injection: `u_id=1' AND (SELECT 1964 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))eXHQ)-- jEhc`
