# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2025-37772
## Query
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved RDMA/cma Fix workqueue crash in cma_netevent_work_handler struct rdma_cm_id has member struct work_struct net_work that is reused for enqueuing cma_netevent_work_handler()s onto cma_wq. Below crash[1] can occur if more than one call to cma_netevent_callback() occurs in quick succession, which further enqueues cma_netevent_work_handler()s for the same rdma_cm_id, overwriting any previously queued work-item(s) that was just scheduled to run i.e. there is no guarantee the queued work item may run between two successive calls to cma_netevent_callback() and the 2nd INIT_WORK would overwrite the 1st work item (for the same rdma_cm_id), despite grabbing id_table_lock during enqueue. Also drgn analysis [2] indicates the work item was likely overwritten. Fix this by moving the INIT_WORK() to __rdma_create_id(), so that it doesnt race with any existing queue_work() or its worker thread.
