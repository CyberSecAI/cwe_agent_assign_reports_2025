  "description": "BentoML version v1.3.4post1 is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. The vulnerability can be exploited by appending characters, such as dashes (-), to the end of a multipart boundary in an HTTP request. This causes the server to continuously process each character, leading to excessive resource consumption and rendering the service unavailable. The issue is unauthenticated and does not require any user interaction, impacting all users of the service.",

CWE-770 is a child of CWE-400, representing a more specific case of resource consumption. However, the description doesn't explicitly mention allocation, so CWE-400 is a better fit. CWE-1284 represents a validation issue on input, so it can precede CWE-770.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe1284[\"CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\"]\n\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    cwe1284 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe400\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe400 primary\n    class cwe770,cwe1284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper** handling of HTTP request multipart boundaries, leading to **uncontrolled resource consumption** and ultimately a Denial of Service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on resource consumption issues due to the vulnerability description explicitly stating \"excessive resource consumption\" leading to \"Denial of Service (DoS)\". The retriever results also highlighted CWE-400, CWE-770, and other related weaknesses.\n\nThe final decision was to primarily assign CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) because the vulnerability description clearly indicates **uncontrolled resource consumption** as the main issue. The server continuously processing each character of the malformed multipart boundary directly leads to this. CWE-770 is considered as a secondary candidate as it's a specific case of resource allocation without limits. CWE-1284 is a secondary candidate because the quantity of characters should be validated.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at an appropriate level of specificity, with CWE-400 being a class-level weakness that broadly covers the issue and CWE-770 being a base-level weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.67\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.66\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
