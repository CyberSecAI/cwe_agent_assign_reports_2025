The other CWEs retrieved had less direct relationships to the vulnerability description.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe359[\"CWE-359: Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    \n    class cwe359 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain is relatively simple:\n\n1.  **ROOT CAUSE:** Presence of **sensitive data** within IDE Tools.\n2.  **WEAKNESS:** **Exposure** of that **sensitive data**.\n3.  **IMPACT:** An attacker can determine the Apple ID of the computer's owner.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause and the resulting impact. The key evidence supporting the selection of CWE-359 is the statement that a privacy issue was addressed by removing **sensitive data** and that an attacker may be able to determine the Apple ID of the owner of the computer. This directly aligns with the description of CWE-359 which is the **Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor**.\n\nThe retriever results also suggested other CWEs, but these were ultimately deemed less relevant.
