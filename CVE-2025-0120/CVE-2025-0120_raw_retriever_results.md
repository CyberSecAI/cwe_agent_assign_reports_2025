# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2025-0120
## Query
A vulnerability with a privilege management mechanism in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app on Windows devices allows a locally authenticated non-administrative Windows user to escalate their privileges to NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM. However, execution requires that the local user can also successfully exploit a race condition, which makes this vulnerability difficult to exploit.

## Keyphrases
- **weakness**: 'race condition'
