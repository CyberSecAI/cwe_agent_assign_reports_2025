  "query": "An information disclosure vulnerability exists in Yugabyte Anywhere, where the LDAP bind password is logged in plaintext within application logs. This flaw results in the unintentional exposure of sensitive information in Yugabyte Anywhere logs, potentially allowing unauthorized users with access to these logs to view the LDAP bind password.An attacker with log access could exploit this vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to the LDAP server, leading to potential exposure or compromise of LDAP-managed resources This issue affects YugabyteDB Anywhere from 2.20.0.0 before 2.20.7.0, from 2.23.0.0 before 2.23.1.0, from 2024.1.0.0 before 2024.1.3.0.",
