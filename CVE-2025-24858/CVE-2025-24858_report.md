# Analysis Report for CVE-2025-24858

# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2025-24858

## Description

Develocity (formerly Gradle Enterprise) before 2024.3.1 allows an attacker who has network access to a Develocity server to obtain the hashed password of the system user. The hash algorithm used by Develocity was chosen according to best practices for password storage and provides some protection against brute-force attempts. The applicable severity of this vulnerability depends on whether a Develocity server is accessible by external or unauthorized users, and the complexity of the System User password.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Product:** Develocity
- **Impact:** obtain the hashed password, obtain the System User password
- **Attacker:** attacker who has network access
- **Version:** before 2024.3.1

*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that influences this decision is the parent-child relationships. CWE-256 is chosen because the root cause is the password hash information exposure, which leads to the attacker obtaining the hashed password of the system user. The other CWEs are related to how the password hash could be obtained and what weaknesses could be present.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **exposure** of the hashed password, which may or may not have been stored in plaintext (depending on what "obtain" means). This could lead to an attacker gaining unauthorized access.

CWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password) -> Possible unauthorized access

## Summary of Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-256 because the main vulnerability is that the system user's hashed password can be obtained. This suggests that the password hash might be stored insecurely, potentially in plaintext.

The evidence for this is:

*   "allows an attacker who has network access to a Develocity server to **obtain the hashed password** of the system user"
*   "**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Password hash information exposure**."

Other CWEs such as CWE-916 (Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort) and CWE-328 (Use of Weak Hash) were considered but are not the primary issue. The vulnerability description states, "The hash algorithm used by Develocity was chosen according to best practices for password storage and provides some protection against brute-force attempts," which suggests these aren't the primary issue, but they can contribute if they are present.
CWE-201, CWE-522, CWE-798, and CWE-319 were also considered as they provide a possible pathway on how to obtain the hashed password.

**Therefore, the primary CWE is CWE-256 because the root cause is the potential for insecure storage or transmission of the hashed password.**

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-836: Use of Password Hash Instead of Password for Authentication
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product records password hashes in a data store, receives a hash of a password from a client, and compares the supplied hash to the hash obtained from the data store.
