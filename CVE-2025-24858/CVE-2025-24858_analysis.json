CWE-256 is chosen because the root cause is the password hash information exposure, which leads to the attacker obtaining the hashed password of the system user. The other CWEs are related to how the password hash could be obtained and what weaknesses could be present.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe256[\"CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe916[\"CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort\"]\n    cwe328[\"CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe256 primary\n    class cwe201,cwe522,cwe798,cwe319,cwe916,cwe328 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **exposure** of the hashed password, which may or may not have been stored in plaintext (depending on what \"obtain\" means). This could lead to an attacker gaining unauthorized access.\n\nCWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password) -> Possible unauthorized access\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-256 because the main vulnerability is that the system user's hashed password can be obtained. This suggests that the password hash might be stored insecurely, potentially in plaintext.\n\nThe evidence for this is:\n\n*   \"allows an attacker who has network access to a Develocity server to **obtain the hashed password** of the system user\"\n*   \"**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Password hash information exposure**.\"\n\nOther CWEs such as CWE-916 (Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort) and CWE-328 (Use of Weak Hash) were considered but are not the primary issue. The vulnerability description states, \"The hash algorithm used by Develocity was chosen according to best practices for password storage and provides some protection against brute-force attempts,\" which suggests these aren't the primary issue, but they can contribute if they are present.\nCWE-201, CWE-522, CWE-798, and CWE-319 were also considered as they provide a possible pathway on how to obtain the hashed password.\n\n**Therefore, the primary CWE is CWE-256 because the root cause is the potential for insecure storage or transmission of the hashed password.**\n\nRelevant CWE
