However, after reviewing the retriever results and guidance, CWE-266 (Incorrect Privilege Assignment) was selected as the primary CWE because it more specifically addresses the **root cause** of the vulnerability. The vulnerability description indicates an **incorrect access control** issue within the `nm` function. Given the available information, CWE-266 best fits the scenario where a privilege is incorrectly assigned, leading to the access control issue.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE Classification Guidance\n\nThe following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:\n\n### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance\n\n## Vulnerability Analysis\n\n**CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment**\n\n*   **Description**: A product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n*   **How it matches**: The vulnerability description states \"**Incorrect Access Control**\" in the `nm --without-symbol-version` function. This suggests that the function might be assigning privileges incorrectly, leading to the access control issue.\n*   **Security Implications**: This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information or functionality.\n*   **Relationship**: Child of CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization), which is a child of CWE-284 (Improper Access Control).\n*   **Mapping Guidance**: Allowed.\n*   **Confidence**: 0.8\n\n**CWE-284: Improper Access Control**\n\n*   **Description**: The product does not adequately control access to resources or functions, allowing unintended access.\n*   **How it matches**: The vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"**Incorrect Access Control**\".\n*   **Security Implications**: This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information or functionality.\n*   **Relationship**: Pillar-level CWE. Parent of CWE-863 and others.\n*   **Mapping Guidance**: Discouraged if a more specific CWE is available.\n*   **Confidence**: 0.6. While the description mentions \"**Incorrect Access Control**\", it's too generic.\n\n**CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization**\n\n*   **Description**: The product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.\n*   **How it matches**: While the description mentions \"**Incorrect Access Control**\", it can be inferred that the authorization check might be performed incorrectly.\n*   **Security Implications**: This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information or functionality.\n*   **Relationship**: Child of CWE-284.\n*   **Mapping Guidance**: Allowed-with-Review.\n*   **Confidence**: 0.5. This is a possibility, but not as directly supported as CWE-266.\n\n**CWEs Considered but Not Used:**\n\n*   CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function): This CWE was not used because the vulnerability description does not explicitly mention missing authentication, but rather an access control problem. The vulnerability description does not provide any information related to the authentication mechanism in the affected component.\n*   CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key): This CWE was not used because the description doesn't indicate a user-controlled key is involved in the authorization process.\n*   CWE-732 (Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource): This CWE was not used because the description indicates a privilege assignment problem, not a permission assignment problem.",
