# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-55954

## Vulnerability Description
OpenObserve is a cloud-native observability platform. A vulnerability in the user management endpoint `/api/{org_id}/users/{email_id}` allows an Admin role user to remove a Root user from the organization. This violates the intended privilege hierarchy, enabling a non-root user to remove the highest-privileged account. Due to **insufficient role checks**, the `remove_user_from_org` function does not prevent an Admin user from removing a Root user. As a result, an attacker with an Admin role can remove critical Root users, potentially gaining effective full control by eliminating the highest-privileged accounts. The `DELETE /api/{org_id}/users/{email_id}` endpoint is affected. This issue has been addressed in release version `0.14.1` and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **insufficient role checks**
- **impact:** remove Root user from organization
- **attacker:** Admin role user
- **product:** OpenObserve
- **component:** /api/{org_id}/users/{email_id} endpoint

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2024-55954 Content

This content **IS RELATED** to CVE-2024-55954. It provides significantly more detail than the placeholder CVE description.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

Insufficient role checks in the `remove_user_from_org` function allow an "Admin" user to remove a "Root" user from the organization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Improper Authorization (CWE-269, CWE-272, CWE-284, CWE-285, CWE-287)
*   Missing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) enforcement.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Unauthorized removal of `root` users.
*   Potential loss of administrative control.
*   `root` user unable to login if removed from all organizations.
*   Privilege escalation and disruption of operations.

**Attack vectors:**

*   Network-accessible API endpoint: `DELETE /api/{org_id}/users/{email_id}`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An authenticated user with the "Admin" role.
*   Ability to send a DELETE request to the affected API endpoint.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   Update authorization logic to enforce strict hierarchical role checks.
*   Ensure only "Root" users can remove other "Root" users.
*   Implement the provided code example to prevent "Admin" accounts from removing "Root" users.

**CVSS Score:** 8.7 (High)

**CVSS v3 base metrics:**

*   Attack Vector: Network (AV:N)
*   Attack Complexity: Low (AC:L)
*   Privileges Required: High (PR:H)
*   User Interaction: None (UI:N)
*   Scope: Changed (S:C)
*   Confidentiality: High (C:H)
*   Integrity: High (I:H)
*   Availability: None (A:N)

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* 🔍 *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* 🔍 *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion – CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### 🔸 CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ✅ *“A user created with the ‘guest’ role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ✅ *“The backup service runs as root but only needs read access.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ⚠️ This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### 🔸 CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ✅ *“User can access another user’s invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.”*

## Mapping Examples – Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *“User can escalate privileges to admin.”*
> ❌ Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged – only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ✅ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**

## Good Mapping Examples – Privileges & Permissions

* ✅ **CWE-266**: *“When a new user registers, the system assigns them admin role due to a missing role validation.”*
* ✅ **CWE-250**: *“Installer runs with system-level privileges but doesn't require them to install files in the user directory.”*
* ✅ **CWE-284**: *“Inconsistent access rules between UI and backend for sensitive endpoints.”*
* ✅ **CWE-285**: *“Authorization logic fails to restrict access to finance reports based on department.”*
