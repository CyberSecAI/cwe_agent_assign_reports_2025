## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content relates to CVE-2024-41320.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a command injection flaw in the `get_apcli_conn_info` function, specifically through the `ifname` parameter. The function calls `mtkwifi.read_pipe`, passing the user-supplied `ifname` parameter, which leads to command execution.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Command injection: User-supplied data is not properly sanitized before being used in a command execution context.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary command execution: Attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the device, potentially gaining full control of the system, modifying settings, or exfiltrating data.
- System compromise: Successful exploitation can lead to a full compromise of the device, allowing for further malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP request: The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable endpoint `/cgi-bin/luci/admin/mtk/wifi/get_apcli_conn_info/`.
- `ifname` parameter: The malicious command is injected through the `ifname` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target device, typically from the local network or potentially from the internet if the device is exposed.
- Knowledge of vulnerable endpoint: The attacker needs to know the specific vulnerable URL to exploit the vulnerability.
- Ability to craft HTTP requests: The attacker needs the ability to construct HTTP GET requests with the malicious payload.
