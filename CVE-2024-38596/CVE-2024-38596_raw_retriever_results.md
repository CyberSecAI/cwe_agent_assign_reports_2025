## Query
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolvedaf_unix Fix data races in unix_release_sock/unix_stream_sendmsgA data-race condition has been identified in af_unix. In one data path,the write function unix_release_sock() atomically writes tosk->sk_shutdown using WRITE_ONCE. However, on the reader side,unix_stream_sendmsg() does not read it atomically. Consequently, thisissue is causing the following KCSAN splat to occur BUG KCSAN data-race in unix_release_sock / unix_stream_sendmsg write (marked) to 0xffff88867256ddbb of 1 bytes by task 7270 on cpu 28 unix_release_sock (net/unix/af_unix.c640) unix_release (net/unix/af_unix.c1050) sock_close (net/socket.c659 net/socket.c1421) __fput (fs/file_table.c422) __fput_sync (fs/file_table.c508) __se_sys_close (fs/open.c1559 fs/open.c1541) __x64_sys_close (fs/open.c1541) x64_sys_call (arch/x86/entry/syscall_64.c33) do_syscall_64 (arch/x86/entry/common.c?) entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe (arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S130) read to 0xffff88867256ddbb of 1 bytes by task 989 on cpu 14 unix_stream_sendmsg (net/unix/af_unix.c2273) __sock_sendmsg (net/socket.c730 net/socket.c745) ____sys_sendmsg (net/socket.c2584) __sys_sendmmsg (net/socket.c2638 net/socket.c2724) __x64_sys_sendmmsg (net/socket.c2753 net/socket.c2750 net/socket.c2750) x64_sys_call (arch/x86/entry/syscall_64.c33) do_syscall_64 (arch/x86/entry/common.c?) entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe (arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S130) value changed 0x01 -> 0x03The line numbers are related to commit dd5a440a31fa (Linux 6.9-rc7).Commit e1d09c2c2f57 (af_unix Fix data races around sk->sk_shutdown.)addressed a comparable issue in the past regarding sk->sk_shutdown.However, it overlooked resolving this particular data path.This patch only offending unix_stream_sendmsg() function, since theother reads seem to be protected by unix_state_lock() as discussed in
