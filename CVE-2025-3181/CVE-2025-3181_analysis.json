  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-3181 Content\n\nBased on the provided content, this relates to a SQL injection vulnerability. The CVE description placeholder is not available, but the content provides more detail than a standard CVE description.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe root cause is insufficient user input validation of the 'scheduleDate' parameter in the `/patient/appointment.php?scheduleDate=1&appid=1` file.  The application directly uses this parameter in SQL queries without proper cleaning or validation, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL code.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   SQL Injection\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   Unauthorized database access\n*   Sensitive data leakage\n*   Data tampering\n*   System control\n*   Service interruption\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   HTTP GET request parameter manipulation: specifically the `scheduleDate` parameter in `/patient/appointment.php?scheduleDate=1&appid=1`.\n*   No login or authorization is required.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   No specific privileges are required. The vulnerability is exploitable without authentication.\n*   Basic understanding of SQL injection techniques.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   **Use prepared statements and parameter binding:** This separates SQL code from user input.\n*   **Input validation and filtering:**  Ensure user input conforms to expected formats.\n*   **Minimize database user permissions:** Use accounts with the least necessary privileges.\n*   **Regular security audits:** Conduct frequent code and system security reviews.\n\n**Payload Examples (provided in the content):**\n\nThe content includes several payload examples for different types of SQL injection attacks, including:\n\n*   Boolean-based blind SQL injection\n*   Time-based blind SQL injection\n*   UNION query SQL injection\n\nThe content also includes a `sqlmap` command used for testing the vulnerability.",

While CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')) is a more general **Class** level CWE, CWE-89 is more precise and accurately reflects the **SQL Injection** vulnerability described.
