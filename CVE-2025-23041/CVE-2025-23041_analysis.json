The application **does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties**. |\n| CWE-20 | Improper Input Validation | 0.6 | Class | Allowed | Secondary Candidate. Because it's a parent of CWE-1284, it's less specific. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship influencing the decision is the parent-child relationship between CWE-20 and CWE-1284. CWE-1284 is a more specific case of CWE-20. The vulnerability involves the **lack of server-side validation of character limits**, which directly relates to the improper handling of a specified quantity (the character limit) in the input.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1284[\"CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    \n    cwe1284 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1284 primary\n    class cwe20 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing server-side validation** (**rootcause**), leading to the possibility of exceeding the intended field lengths.\nRoot Cause: **Missing server-side validation of input length**\nWeakness: **Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input (CWE-1284)**\nImpact: Exceeding field length limitations.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is primarily based on the provided vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary. The description clearly states that the character limits are only validated client-side and not server-side. This **lack of server-side validation** is the core issue.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the selection by highlighting the parent-child relationship between CWE-20 and CWE-1284. While CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) is a broader category, CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input) is more specific and directly relates to the **improper handling of the character limit**.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-1284 directly addresses the **improper validation of a quantity (character length)**, which is the root cause of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-472: External
