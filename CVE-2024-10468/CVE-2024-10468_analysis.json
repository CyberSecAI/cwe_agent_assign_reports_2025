This might allow arbitrary code execution if the attacker can control the memory corruption.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- The attack vector is through the usage of IndexedDB functionality.\n- Triggering the specific race condition to cause memory corruption.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- An attacker needs the ability to interact with IndexedDB functionality in Thunderbird or Firefox. This could be achieved via malicious websites or crafted content.",

The vulnerability is caused by **race conditions** within the IndexedDB implementation.|\n| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate. **Memory corruption** could be caused by out-of-bounds write. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-362, which is a class-level CWE. While more specific Base-level CWEs related to race conditions exist (e.g., CWE-367, CWE-366, CWE-364), CWE-362 is the most appropriate high-level classification given the information available, as it captures the general nature of the **race condition** vulnerability.
