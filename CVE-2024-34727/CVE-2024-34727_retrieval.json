This could lead to remote information disclosure with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'heap buffer overflow'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1.

CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound) (Score: 394.83)\n\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result....\n\n### 4. CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size (Score: 388.51)\n\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow....\n\n### 5.
