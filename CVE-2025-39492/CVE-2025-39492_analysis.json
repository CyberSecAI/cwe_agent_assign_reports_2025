CWE-22 is a broader category of path traversal that encompasses CWE-23. CWE-73 represents the external control aspect, showing that the file name or path is influenced by user input. The hierarchical relationship shows that CWE-23 is a child of CWE-22.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe23[\"CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\"]\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\"]\n    cwe73[\"CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\"]\n\n    cwe23 -->|CHILDOF| cwe22\n    cwe23 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe73\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe23 primary\n    class cwe22,cwe73 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **Relative Path Traversal** (CWE-23) due to **improper neutralization of path sequences** in user-controlled input. This leads to a broader **Path Traversal** issue (CWE-22) where the application fails to restrict the pathname to a restricted directory. Ultimately, this is caused by **External Control of File Name or Path** (CWE-73).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis indicates that the vulnerability is a **Path Traversal vulnerability** where **Relative Path Traversal** is specified. The key phrase \"Path Traversal vulnerability\" and \"Relative Path Traversal\" both point to CWE-23 as the primary weakness. The evidence is derived directly from the vulnerability description, which states \"Path Traversal vulnerability in WHMPress WHMpress allows Relative Path Traversal.\"\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the decision to include CWE-22 and CWE-73 as secondary CWEs. CWE-22 is a parent of CWE-23, while CWE-73 represents the external control aspect, showing that the file name or path is influenced by user input.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at an optimal level of specificity. CWE-23 accurately represents the specific type of path traversal (relative), while CWE-22 and CWE-73 provide additional context.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
