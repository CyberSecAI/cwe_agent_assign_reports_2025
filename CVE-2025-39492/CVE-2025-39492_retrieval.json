Here\\'s a breakdown of the information extracted:\\n\\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\\n\\n*   Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability exists in the WHMpress plugin.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\\n\\n*   Local File Inclusion\\n\\n**Impact of exploitation:**\\n\\n*   A malicious actor can include local files of the target website and display their contents.\\n*   Potentially, database credentials stored in included files could be compromised, leading to complete database takeover (depending on configuration).\\n\\n**Attack vectors:**\\n\\n*   The content doesn\\'t specify the exact attack vector, but it implies an attacker can manipulate the application to include arbitrary local files.\\n\\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\\n\\n*   The content states \"Contributor\" privilege is required, suggesting a user with at least contributor access could potentially exploit the vulnerability.\\n\\n**Mitigation or fix:**\\n\\n*   No official fix is currently available.\\n*   Patchstack offers a \"vPatch\" as a temporary mitigation.\\n*   The vulnerable version is <= 6.2-revision-9.\\n\\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\\n\\n*   **CVSS Score:** 7.5 (Low severity)\\n*   **OWASP Top 10:** A3: Injection\\n*   **Reported Date:** 24 Nov 2024\\n*   **Published Date:** 16 May 2025\\n*   **Researcher:** Bonds\\n*   The vulnerability is considered unlikely to be exploited due to its low severity.', similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {},
