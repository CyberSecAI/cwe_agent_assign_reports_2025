It provides detailed information about a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the WordPress Restrict User Registration plugin.\\n\\nHere's a breakdown of the extracted information:\\n\\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\\n\\nThe vulnerability is a Cross Site Scripting (XSS) issue, allowing malicious script injection.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\\n\\n*   **Cross Site Scripting (XSS):**  The plugin is vulnerable to XSS, enabling attackers to inject malicious scripts into the website.\\n\\n**Impact of exploitation:**\\n\\n*   Malicious actors can inject scripts (redirects, advertisements, HTML payloads) that will be executed when visitors access the site.\\n\\n**Attack vectors:**\\n\\n*   The vulnerability is exploitable by unauthenticated attackers.\\n\\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\\n\\n*   No authentication required.\\n\\n**Mitigation or fix:**\\n\\n*   **vPatch:** Patchstack has released a virtual patch to mitigate the issue until an official fix is available.\\n*   **Remove/Replace:** The software is likely abandoned and should be removed and replaced with an alternative. Deactivating the plugin alone is insufficient without a vPatch.\\n\\n**Additional Details:**\\n\\n*   **Affected Software:** WordPress Restrict User Registration Plugin\\n*   **Vulnerable Versions:** <= 1.0.1\\n*   **Fixed Version:** N/A (as of the report)\\n*   **CVSS Score:** 7.1 (Medium)\\n*   **OWASP Top 10:** A3: Injection\\n*   **PSID:** 83429c9b35c9\\n*   **Reported by:** Abdi Pranata\\n*   **Published:** April 12, 2025\\n*   **Last Updated:** Over a year ago, indicating the software is likely abandoned.\\n\\n**Note:** This content provides more detail than the placeholder CVE description. It specifies the vulnerable software, versions, CVSS score, and mitigation steps.\", similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {}, 'top_cwes_by_threshold': {}}}, similarity_summary=SimilarityInsight(consensus_cwe='', top_cwes=[], confidence_levels={}, total_samples=0), analysis='', analysis_with_relationships='', criticism='', resolution='', relevant_cwes=[{'metadata': {'doc_id': '352', 'name': 'Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'rootcause:Cross-Site Request Forgery', 'keyphrase': 'Cross-Site Request Forgery', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'weakness:cross-site scripting', 'keyphrase': 'cross-site scripting', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'weakness:XSS', 'keyphrase': 'XSS', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'product:DevriX Restrict User Registration', 'keyphrase': 'DevriX Restrict User Registration', 'type': 'product'}, {'id': 'version:through 1.0.1', 'keyphrase': 'through 1.0.1', 'type': 'version'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(290.55732349925813)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '918', 'name': 'Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The web server receives a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'rootcause:Cross-Site Request Forgery', 'keyphrase': 'Cross-Site Request Forgery', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'weakness:cross-site scripting', 'keyphrase': 'cross-site scripting', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'weakness:XSS', 'keyphrase': 'XSS', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'product:DevriX Restrict User Registration', 'keyphrase': 'DevriX Restrict User Registration', 'type': 'product'}, {'id': 'version:through 1.0.1', 'keyphrase': 'through 1.0.1', 'type': 'version'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(252.33994741398317)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '89', 'name': \"Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\", 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.
