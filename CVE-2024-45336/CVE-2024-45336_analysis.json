CWE-201 is a base-level CWE that accurately captures the root cause, while CWE-668 is a class-level CWE that describes the broader impact of exposing resources to the wrong sphere. The \"CanFollow\" relationships of CWE-201 suggest potential follow-up weaknesses, but none are directly applicable in this case. The Retriever Results listed CWE-212, which is a peer of CWE-201, but it wasn't as accurate because the sensitive information is not being stored or transferred, but rather being sent. The abstraction level of CWE-201 being Base made it a more suitable choice than the Class-level CWE-668.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    cwe212[\"CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\"]\n\n    cwe201 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe212\n    cwe201 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n    cwe212 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe201 primary\n    class cwe668 secondary\n    class cwe212 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the HTTP client **incorrectly sending sensitive headers** after a cross-domain redirect due to a subsequent same-domain redirect. This leads to the **insertion of sensitive information into sent data**, which can then lead to the **exposure of the resource to the wrong sphere**.\n  - The root cause is the improper handling of sensitive headers during redirects.\n  - This leads to the inclusion of sensitive information in the request to the final destination.\n  - The impact is potential exposure of sensitive data to an unintended recipient.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the **root cause** of the vulnerability, which is the **incorrect handling of sensitive headers** during cross-domain redirects. The retriever results suggested several potential CWEs, but CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data) best captures the specific weakness. The vulnerability description clearly states that the HTTP client **sends sensitive headers** to an unintended destination after a series of redirects. This aligns directly with the description of CWE-201.\n\nThe evidence is the following: \"In the event that the client received a subsequent same-domain redirect, however, the sensitive headers would be restored. For example, a chain of redirects from a.com/, to b.com/1, and finally to b.com/2 would **incorrectly send the Authorization header** to b.com/2.\"\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the selection by highlighting the parent-child relationship between CWE-201 and CWE-668, which helped in understanding the broader impact of the vulnerability.\n\nCWE-201 is selected because it is at the optimal level of specificity. It is a Base-level CWE that directly addresses the **insertion of sensitive information** into the sent data. While other CWEs like CWE-668 describe the broader impact, CWE-201 focuses on the core weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n*   **CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data**\n\n    *   **Technical Explanation:** The vulnerability involves the **unintended inclusion of sensitive headers (like Authorization)** in HTTP requests after a cross-domain redirect, specifically when a subsequent same-domain redirect occurs. This results in the sensitive information being sent to a potentially untrusted destination.\n    *   **Security Implications:** This can lead to the exposure of sensitive credentials or other confidential information, potentially allowing unauthorized access or data breaches.\n    *   **Relationship Analysis:** CWE-201 is a Base-level CWE. The parent is CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere).\n    *   **Mapping Guidance Influence:** The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-201 allows its usage, reinforcing its appropriateness for this vulnerability.\n    *   **Confidence:** 0.90\n\n*   **CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere**\n    *   **Technical Explanation:** The vulnerability exposes sensitive information by sending it to a domain it was not intended for. The Authorization header which is meant to be private between the client and the intended server is being sent to a different server.\n    *   **Security Implications:** Sensitive information can be exposed to unintended parties.\n    *   **Relationship Analysis:** CWE-668 is a Class-level CWE.\n    *   **Mapping Guidance Influence:** The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-668 discourages its usage because it is high-level, but it can be used as a secondary CWE to provide the broader context of the vulnerability's impact.\n    *   **Confidence:** 0.70",
