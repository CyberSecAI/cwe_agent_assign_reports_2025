A logical weakness during the capture of a payment in case of disabled webhooks can be exploited to create an accepted order. This could allow a threat actor to confirm an order with a fraudulent payment support. Versions 6.4.2 and 3.18.1 contain a patch for the issue. Additionally, users enable webhooks and check they are callable. Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-841 CWE-565 CWE-297 CWE-306 CWE-472 CWE-352 CWE-184 CWE-200 CWE-287 CWE-367",
