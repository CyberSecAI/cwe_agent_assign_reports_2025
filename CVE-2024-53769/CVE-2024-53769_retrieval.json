Specific impacts would depend on the actions available within the vulnerable plugin.\\n\\n**Attack Vectors:**\\n*   The attacker would need to craft a malicious request that targets a vulnerable action within the plugin. This request would be triggered when a logged-in, authenticated user with sufficient privileges interacts with the malicious request, usually by clicking a link or visiting a compromised page.\\n\\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\\n*   The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user with sufficient privileges into interacting with a malicious request.\\n*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated.\\n\\n**Additional Notes:**\\n\\n*   The software is likely abandoned and will probably not receive further updates. It is recommended to replace the software with an alternative.\\n*   The vulnerability has a low severity impact and is unlikely to be exploited.\\n*   The reported CVSS score is 7.1, which would normally indicate High severity, but is considered Low by Patchstack in this case, as it is not ideal for CMSs.\\n*   There is no official fix available.\", similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {}, 'top_cwes_by_threshold': {}}}, similarity_summary=SimilarityInsight(consensus_cwe='', top_cwes=[], confidence_levels={}, total_samples=0), analysis='', analysis_with_relationships='', criticism='', resolution='', relevant_cwes=[{'metadata': {'doc_id': '352', 'name': 'Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'rootcause:lack of CSRF protection', 'keyphrase': 'lack of CSRF protection', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'weakness:XSS', 'keyphrase': 'XSS', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'weakness:cross-site scripting', 'keyphrase': 'cross-site scripting', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'product:Ludovic RIAUDEL Custom Post Type to Map Store', 'keyphrase': 'Ludovic RIAUDEL Custom Post Type to Map Store', 'type': 'product'}, {'id': 'version:n/a through 1.1.0', 'keyphrase': 'n/a through 1.1.0', 'type': 'version'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(339.1564478224211)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '434', 'name': 'Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'rootcause:lack of CSRF protection', 'keyphrase': 'lack of CSRF protection', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'weakness:XSS', 'keyphrase': 'XSS', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'weakness:cross-site scripting', 'keyphrase': 'cross-site scripting', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'product:Ludovic RIAUDEL Custom Post Type to Map Store', 'keyphrase': 'Ludovic RIAUDEL Custom Post Type to Map Store', 'type': 'product'}, {'id': 'version:n/a through 1.1.0', 'keyphrase': 'n/a through 1.1.0', 'type': 'version'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(258.19882886271165)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '79', 'name': \"Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\", 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'rootcause:lack of CSRF protection', 'keyphrase': 'lack of CSRF protection', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'weakness:XSS', 'keyphrase': 'XSS', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'weakness:cross-site scripting', 'keyphrase': 'cross-site scripting', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'product:Ludovic RIAUDEL Custom Post Type to Map Store', 'keyphrase': 'Ludovic RIAUDEL Custom Post Type to Map Store', 'type': 'product'}, {'id': 'version:n/a through 1.1.0', 'keyphrase': 'n/a through 1.1.0', 'type': 'version'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(248.90939461570417)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '116', 'name': 'Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
