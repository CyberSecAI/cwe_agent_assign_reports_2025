The CSRF **weakness** allows an attacker to induce unintended actions on a web application, and in this case, it leads to stored XSS, which is a type of CWE-79. CWE-352 is a compound weakness, which is acceptable, but not preferred, while CWE-79 is a base weakness.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    \n    cwe79 -- CANFOLLOW --> cwe352\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe352 primary\n    class cwe79 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability**, which allows an attacker to perform actions on behalf of a user without their knowledge or consent. This leads to the **impact** of Stored XSS (Cross-Site Scripting), where malicious scripts are injected and stored on the server, affecting other users.\n\nCWE-352 (Root Cause) -> CWE-79 (Impact/Result)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** as the primary **weakness** due to its presence in the vulnerability description. The analysis also considered the resulting Stored XSS. The evidence for CSRF is present in the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section: \"**weakness:** **Cross-Site Request Forgery**\".\n\nThe evidence for XSS is that \"impact: Stored XSS, Cross-Site Scripting\"\n\nBased on the evidence, CWE-352 [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)] is the most appropriate primary CWE because it describes the initial **weakness** that allows the subsequent Stored XSS. CWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')] is a secondary weakness as it describes the resulting vulnerability (Stored XSS).\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-352 is a compound weakness, but it is the most accurate representation of the root cause.
