# Vulnerability Description

    In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ASoC qcom sc7280 Fix missing Soundwire runtime stream alloc Commit 15c7fab0e047 (ASoC qcom Move Soundwire runtime stream alloc to soundcards) moved the allocation of Soundwire stream runtime from the Qualcomm Soundwire driver to each individual machine sound card driver, except that it **forgot to update SC7280 card**. Just like for other Qualcomm sound cards using Soundwire, the card driver should allocate and release the runtime. Otherwise sound playback will result in a NULL pointer dereference or other effect of **uninitialized memory** accesses (which was confirmed on SDM845 having similar issue).
