The CVE reference link provides more details about the root cause being due to malformed RDP PDUs, which leads to **uncontrolled resource consumption**.\n\nCWE-772 (Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime) is the most appropriate primary CWE because it directly addresses the **resource leak** mentioned in the vulnerability description.
