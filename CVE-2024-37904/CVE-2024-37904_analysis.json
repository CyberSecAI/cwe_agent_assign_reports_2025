  "description": "Minder is an open source Software Supply Chain Security Platform. Minders Git provider is vulnerable to a denial of service from a maliciously configured GitHub repository. The Git provider clones users repositories using the `github.com/go-git/go-git/v5` library on lines `L55-L89`. The Git provider does the following on the lines `L56-L62`. First, it sets the `CloneOptions`, specifying the url, the depth etc. It then validates the options. It then sets up an in-memory filesystem, to which it clones and Finally, it clones the repository. The `(g *Git) Clone()` method is vulnerable to a DoS attack A Minder user can instruct Minder to clone a large repository which will exhaust memory and crash the Minder server. The root cause of this vulnerability is a combination of the following conditions 1. Users can control the Git URL which Minder clones, 2. Minder **does not enforce a size limit** to the repository, 3. Minder clones the entire repository into memory. This issue has been addressed in commit `7979b43` which has been included in release version v0.0.52. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Vulnerability:** Denial of Service (DoS)\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe vulnerability stems from the `Clone` function in Minder's Git provider, which clones Git repositories into memory without enforcing size limits. This allows a malicious user to trigger excessive memory consumption by instructing Minder to clone an extremely large repository. The combination of user-controlled Git URLs, lack of size limits, and cloning the entire repository into memory are the underlying causes.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n- Unrestricted Git URL input allows users to specify any repository.\n- Lack of repository size limits.\n- The entire repository is cloned into memory.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- Memory exhaustion on the Minder server.\n- Potential crashing or termination of the Minder server (SigKill).\n- Denial of service for other users.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- Maliciously configured Git repository.\n- A user providing a URL to an extremely large Git repository for cloning.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- A legitimate user of the Minder system with the ability to specify the Git repository URL to clone.\n- No special privileges are required, just the capability to interact with the system's cloning functionality.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n- The vulnerability is in the `internal/providers/git/git.go` file of the Minder project.\n- The vulnerable code uses the `github.com/go-git/go-git/v5` library for Git operations.\n- The fix introduces size limits for both the number of files and the total size of the repository cloned into the system.\n- The fix introduces a custom `memboxfs` filesystem that allows specifying file count and size limits to avoid memory exhaustion.\n- A proof-of-concept (PoC) is provided, demonstrating the memory exhaustion with a large git repo and multiple concurrent clone requests.\n- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 5.7 (Moderate), with a high impact on availability.\n\n**Patched Version**:\nThe vulnerability is fixed in version `0.20240612.2316+ref.7979b43`.\n\nThis information is more detailed than a typical CVE description, providing a clear understanding of the vulnerability, its cause, impact, and how it can be exploited.",

This leads to cloning of a large repository into memory based on user-controlled input (**CWE-789**), culminating in memory exhaustion and denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis strongly points to **CWE-770** as the primary weakness because the root cause is the **failure to limit or throttle the allocation of resources**, specifically the size of the repository being cloned. The vulnerability description highlights that the Minder system **does not enforce a size limit** on the repository. The resulting memory exhaustion is a direct consequence of this missing limit. The description states \"A Minder user can instruct Minder to clone a large repository which will exhaust memory and crash the Minder server\".\n\n**CWE-789** is considered a secondary weakness, as it describes the specific case of allocating excessive memory. However, the more general **CWE-770** better captures the fundamental issue of resource management.\n\nThe hierarchical relationship between **CWE-770** and **CWE-789** confirms that **CWE-789** is a more specific instance of the broader resource allocation problem described by **CWE-770**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1286: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input that is expected to be well-formed - i.e., to comply with a certain syntax - but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input complies with the syntax.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-88: Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs a string for a command to be executed by a separate component\nin another control sphere, but it does not properly delimit the\nintended arguments, options, or switches within that command string.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
