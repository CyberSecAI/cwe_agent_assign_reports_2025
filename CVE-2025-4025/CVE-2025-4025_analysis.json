  "reference_content": "The content relates to CVE-2025-4025.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nA SQL injection vulnerability was found in the '/registration.php' file of the 'Placement Management System' project. The reason for this issue is that attackers inject malicious code from the parameter 'name\u2018 and use it directly in SQL queries without the need for appropriate cleaning or validation.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\nSQL injection\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nAttackers can exploit this SQL injection vulnerability to achieve unauthorized database access, sensitive data leakage, data tampering, comprehensive system control, and even service interruption.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\nThe vulnerability is exploitable without login or authorization, via a POST request to `/Placement/registration.php` with a malicious `name` parameter.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\nNo specific position or privileges are required. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability without authentication.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   Use prepared statements and parameter binding.\n*   Input validation and filtering.\n*   Minimize database user permissions.\n*   Regular security audits.\n\n**Vulnerability details and POC:**\n\nThe content provides a sample POST request and several payloads for boolean-based blind, error-based, and time-based blind SQL injection attacks targeting the 'name' parameter. It also includes screenshots of sqlmap output.\n\nThis content provides more detail than the official CVE description would likely contain, specifically including the proof-of-concept (POC) and sqlmap output.",

There are no direct parent-child or chain relationships that significantly influence the selection in this case. The high retriever score and direct mention of \"SQL Injection\" strongly support this choice.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe89 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper neutralization** leading directly to **SQL Injection**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary assessment is based on the clear evidence provided in the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary. The description explicitly mentions \"**sql injection**\" as the **weakness** and details how the manipulation of the `Name` argument leads to this vulnerability. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the **root cause** is the injection of malicious code from the `name` parameter directly into SQL queries without proper sanitization. The retriever results also strongly suggest CWE-89 as the most relevant CWE, with a score of 1.0.
