# Analysis Report for CVE-2024-3604

# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-3604

## Description

The OSM - OpenStreetMap plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the tagged_filter attribute of the osm_map_v3 shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 6.0.2 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-89 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE: This is the direct result of **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship to consider here is that CWE-89 is a Base level CWE, which is the preferred level of abstraction. There are no child CWEs listed that would provide a more specific classification. The other CWEs considered are either higher-level classes (e.g., CWE-138, CWE-116) or represent different types of vulnerabilities (e.g., CWE-79 for XSS, CWE-90 for LDAP injection). The relationships of other CWEs to CWE-89 (e.g., ParentOf, ChildOf) are not directly relevant to the root cause in this specific vulnerability description.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain is straightforward:
1.  **Root Cause:** **Insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query** (CWE-89).
2.  **Impact:** Ability to extract sensitive information from the database and potential for full database compromise (information disclosure).

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is strongly based on the provided evidence. The vulnerability description explicitly states the root cause as "**insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**" and the resulting **weakness** as "**SQL injection**". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this by stating, "The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, which occurs due to improper handling of the `tagged_filter` parameter."

The Retriever Results also strongly support CWE-89 as the most relevant CWE, with a score of 1.0.

The relationship analysis confirms that CWE-89 is the most specific and appropriate CWE based on the evidence. It is a Base level CWE, and no child CWEs are more fitting. Other CWEs like CWE-79 (XSS) and CWE-90 (LDAP Injection) are not applicable because the vulnerability specifically involves SQL injection.

The selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the root cause: **improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL command**.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
**Abstraction Level**: Compound
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.

*Not Selected*: This CWE is not applicable as the vulnerability is related to SQL Injection, not CSRF.

## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

*Not Selected*: While encoding/escaping is relevant to preventing SQL injection, CWE-89 more directly captures the **improper neutralization** within the SQL context.

## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected*: This CWE relates to authorization issues, not SQL Injection.

## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected*: This CWE is not applicable as the vulnerability is related to SQL Injection, not authorization bypass.

## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected*: While this relates to input validation, CWE-89 more specifically addresses the **improper neutralization** in an SQL context.

## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense
