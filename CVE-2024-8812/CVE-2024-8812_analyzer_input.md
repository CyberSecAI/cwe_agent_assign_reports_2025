# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-8812

## Vulnerability Description
PDF-XChange Editor U3D File Parsing **Out-Of-Bounds Read** Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of PDF-XChange Editor. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of U3D files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-24207.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of U3D files in PDF-XChange Editor.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Out-of-bounds read:** The insufficient validation leads to a read operation that goes beyond the boundaries of an allocated buffer. This type of memory access violation can lead to crashes, unexpected behavior, and potentially more severe security issues.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can leverage the out-of-bounds read vulnerability to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process running PDF-XChange Editor. This allows the attacker to gain control of the system and perform actions like data theft, system modification, or deploying malware.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious U3D file:** The attacker can craft a malicious U3D file.
*   **User Interaction:** The target user must open this crafted malicious U3D file within the PDF-XChange Editor application for the exploit to be triggered. The advisory also mentions visiting a malicious page, which likely refers to embedding a malicious U3D file within the context of a web page designed to trigger the exploit through the application's handling of U3D files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote:** The attacker can be remote since the vulnerability can be triggered by a specially crafted file.
*   **User Interaction Required:** The user must open the malicious file or visit a malicious webpage to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details (from the advisory):**

*   **CVSS Score:** 7.8 (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H), indicating a high severity vulnerability.
*   **Affected Products:** PDF-XChange Editor.
*   **Fixed Version:** The vulnerability is fixed in version 10.3.1.387 of PDF-XChange Editor.
*   **Vendor:** PDF-XChange (Tracker Software).
*   **Disclosure Timeline:** The vulnerability was reported to the vendor on 2024-05-19 and publicly disclosed on 2024-09-17.
