No specific child CWE is evident from the provided description because the specific access control **incorrectness** is not described. The retriever results provided several potential child CWEs, but without more information, selecting a specific child CWE would be speculative.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe284 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **incorrect access control** (CWE-284), which can lead to unauthorized access to resources. The description provides only the root cause, and the chain stops there.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-284 as the most appropriate mapping due to the **incorrect access control** issue highlighted in the vulnerability description. The description indicates a general access control problem without specifying the exact nature of the flaw. Given the limited information, a more specific CWE cannot be assigned with high confidence.\n\nThe selection of CWE-284 is based on the vulnerability description, specifically the phrase \"**Incorrect Access Control**.\" While retriever results suggested other CWEs like CWE-1191 (On-Chip Debug and Test Interface With Improper Access Control) and CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key), these are too specific without additional details about the type of **access control** that is failing.\n\nThe decision to use CWE-284 is at the optimal level of specificity, given the available evidence.\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1263: Improper Physical Access Control\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is designed with access restricted to certain information, but it does not sufficiently protect against an unauthorized actor with physical access to these areas.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.

It is not useful for trend analysis.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements access controls via a policy or other feature with the intention to disable or restrict accesses (reads and/or writes) to assets in a system from untrusted agents.

Shadow registers and mirror registers typically refer to registers that can be accessed from multiple addresses. Writing to or reading from the aliased/mirrored address has the same effect as writing to the address of the main register. They are typically implemented within an IP core or SoC to temporarily hold certain data. These data will later be updated to the main register, and both registers will be in synch.
