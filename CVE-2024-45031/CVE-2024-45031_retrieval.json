This made it possible to inject stored **XSS** payloads which would trigger for other users during ordinary usage of the application. **XSS** payloads could also be injected in Syncope Enduser when editing Personal Information or User Requests such payloads would trigger for administrators in Syncope Console, thus enabling session hijacking.

This means malicious scripts are not just reflected in a user\\'s browser but are saved within the application itself.\\n*   **Insufficient HTML Sanitization:** The application\\'s HTML sanitization is not robust enough to handle incomplete HTML tags, allowing for XSS payloads.\\n\\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\\n*   **Session Hijacking:** An attacker can inject XSS payloads in Syncope Enduser, which then triggers for administrators in Syncope Console. This enables session hijacking as the malicious script can steal session cookies and other sensitive information.\\n*   **Data Exposure:** Successful XSS attacks could also be leveraged to potentially steal other sensitive data.\\n*   **Malicious actions:** Execution of arbitrary scripts in the context of the victim\\'s browser can be used for various malicious actions.\\n\\n**Attack Vectors:**\\n*   **Syncope Console:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by editing objects in the Syncope Console with incomplete HTML tags.\\n*   **Syncope Enduser:** Attackers can inject payloads when editing \"Personal Information\" or \"User Requests\" in the Syncope Enduser interface.\\n\\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\\n*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have at least user-level access in the Syncope instance.\\n*   **Knowledge of exploitation techniques:** The attacker needs some technical knowledge to craft the XSS payloads using incomplete HTML tags.\\n\\n**Affected Versions:**\\n*   Apache Syncope 2.1 through 2.1.14\\n*   Apache Syncope 3.0 through 3.0.8\\n\\n**Mitigation:**\\n*   Upgrade to Apache Syncope version 3.0.9 or later to address the vulnerability.\\n\\nThe provided information is more detailed than the typical CVE description, outlining both the console and end-user attack vectors and the session hijacking potential.', similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {}, 'top_cwes_by_threshold': {}}}, similarity_summary=SimilarityInsight(consensus_cwe='', top_cwes=[], confidence_levels={}, total_samples=0), analysis='', analysis_with_relationships='', criticism='', resolution='', relevant_cwes=[{'metadata': {'doc_id': '116', 'name': 'Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.

    "enhanced_query": "# Vulnerability Description\n\n    When editing objects in the Syncope Console, **incomplete HTML tags** could be used to bypass HTML sanitization. This made it possible to inject stored **XSS** payloads which would trigger for other users during ordinary usage of the application. **XSS** payloads could also be injected in Syncope Enduser when editing Personal Information or User Requests such payloads would trigger for administrators in Syncope Console, thus enabling session hijacking. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 3.0.9, which fixes this issue.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'incomplete HTML tags'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1.
