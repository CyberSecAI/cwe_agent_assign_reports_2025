### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **Improper Neutralization of Delimiters**
- **impact:** infinite loop
- **vector:** input string with unexpected characters
- **product:** Cesanta Mongoose Web Server
- **version:** v7.14

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-42392

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Improper neutralization of delimiters in the Cesanta Mongoose Web Server library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The vulnerability lies in how the Mongoose Web Server v7.14 handles input strings, specifically when these strings contain unexpected characters acting as delimiters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can trigger an infinite loop bug by providing specially crafted input strings. This leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, where the server becomes unresponsive.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending an input string containing unexpected characters to the vulnerable web server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send data to the vulnerable Mongoose Web Server.
- The attack has a CVSS score of 4.0, with vectors specified as:
    - **AV:L** (Local)
    - **AC:H** (High)
    - **PR:H** (High)
    - **UI:R** (Required)
    - **S:U** (Unchanged)
    - **C:N** (None)
    - **I:N** (None)
    - **A:H** (High)
This indicates that the attack requires local access, a high level of privileges, user interaction, and results in a high impact on availability, but no impact on confidentiality or integrity.

**Additional Notes:**
- The advisory suggests not exposing the vulnerable component in an untrusted network.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Gabriele Quagliarella of Nozomi Networks.
- The affected version is Cesanta Mongoose Web Server v7.14.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-154: Improper Neutralization of Variable Name Delimiters
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as variable name delimiters when they are sent to a downstream component.

### Extended Description
As data is parsed, an injected delimiter may cause the process to take unexpected actions that result in an attack. Example: "$" for an environment variable.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-138

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Research Gap]** Under-studied.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2005-0129:** "%" variable is expanded by wildcard function into disallowed commands.

## CWE-88: Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product constructs a string for a command to be executed by a separate component
in another control sphere, but it does not properly delimit the
intended arguments, options, or switches within that command string.

### Extended Description


When creating commands using interpolation into a string, developers may assume that only the arguments/options that they specify will be processed. This assumption may be even stronger when the programmer has encoded the command in a way that prevents separate commands from being provided maliciously, e.g. in the case of shell metacharacters. When constructing the command, the developer may use whitespace or other delimiters that are required to separate arguments when the command. However, if an attacker can provide an untrusted input that contains argument-separating delimiters, then the resulting command will have more arguments than intended by the developer. The attacker may then be able to change the behavior of the command. Depending on the functionality supported by the extraneous arguments, this may have security-relevant consequences.


### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-77
ChildOf -> CWE-74
ChildOf -> CWE-77
ChildOf -> CWE-77

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** At one layer of abstraction, this can overlap other weaknesses that have whitespace problems, e.g. injection of javascript into attributes of HTML tags.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-36069:** Python-based dependency management tool avoids OS command injection when generating Git commands but allows injection of optional arguments with input beginning with a dash (CWE-88), potentially allowing for code execution.
- **CVE-1999-0113:** Canonical Example - "-froot" argument is passed on to another program, where the "-f" causes execution as user "root"
- **CVE-2001-0150:** Web browser executes Telnet sessions using command line arguments that are specified by the web site, which could allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands.
