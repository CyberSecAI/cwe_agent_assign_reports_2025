  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-42392\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n- Improper neutralization of delimiters in the Cesanta Mongoose Web Server library.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n- The vulnerability lies in how the Mongoose Web Server v7.14 handles input strings, specifically when these strings contain unexpected characters acting as delimiters.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- An attacker can trigger an infinite loop bug by providing specially crafted input strings. This leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, where the server becomes unresponsive.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- The vulnerability is triggered by sending an input string containing unexpected characters to the vulnerable web server.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- The attacker needs to be able to send data to the vulnerable Mongoose Web Server.\n- The attack has a CVSS score of 4.0, with vectors specified as:\n    - **AV:L** (Local)\n    - **AC:H** (High)\n    - **PR:H** (High)\n    - **UI:R** (Required)\n    - **S:U** (Unchanged)\n    - **C:N** (None)\n    - **I:N** (None)\n    - **A:H** (High)\nThis indicates that the attack requires local access, a high level of privileges, user interaction, and results in a high impact on availability, but no impact on confidentiality or integrity.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The advisory suggests not exposing the vulnerable component in an untrusted network.\n- The vulnerability was discovered by Gabriele Quagliarella of Nozomi Networks.\n- The affected version is Cesanta Mongoose Web Server v7.14.",
