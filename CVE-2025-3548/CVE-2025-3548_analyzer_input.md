# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-3548

## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, has been found in Open Asset Import Library Assimp up to 5.4.3. This issue affects the function aiStringSet in the library include/assimp/types.h of the component File Handler. The manipulation leads to **heap-based buffer overflow**. It is possible to launch the attack on the local host. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **product:** Open Asset Import Library Assimp
- **version:** up to 5.4.3
- **component:** aiStringSet in include/assimp/types.h

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE Content

Based on the provided content, this relates to **CVE-2025-3548** as it describes a vulnerability discovered in the Assimp Library. The content provides more detail than a typical CVE description would initially.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow in the `aiString::Set` function. It occurs because the `strlen` function is called without sufficient bounds checking, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds read when determining the length of the input string. While there *is* a length check, it casts the `strlen` result to a signed integer (`ai_int32`), which can lead to incorrect comparisons and allow overflows.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Heap-based Buffer Overflow (CWE-122):** The core vulnerability.
*   **Integer Overflow/Truncation:** The cast from `ai_uint32` (returned by `strlen`) to `ai_int32` can cause issues.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Application crash (demonstrated by the AddressSanitizer report).
*   Potential for arbitrary code execution (though not explicitly stated, a heap overflow can often be exploited for this).

**Attack vectors:**

*   Processing malformed files that contain strings designed to trigger the overflow.
*   The provided PoC demonstrates triggering the vulnerability using a specifically crafted file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to provide a file that is processed by the Assimp library. This could be through a file upload feature, loading a malicious model, or other means of file input.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   The pull request #6073 merged a fix that addresses the implicit cast from `size_t` to `uint32_t`. This likely corrects the bounds checking logic and prevents the overflow.
*   The fix likely involves using a more appropriate data type for the length comparison to avoid the truncation issue.
