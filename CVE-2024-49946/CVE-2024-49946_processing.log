2025-07-12 05:24:28 | INFO     | Keyphrases - Rootcause: The ppp_channel_bridge_input function in the Linux kernel's PPP implementation does not properly handle cases where it is called from a process context, leading to a potential lock state inconsistency and deadlock., Weakness: The ppp_channel_bridge_input function assumes it is always called from a bottom half (BH) handler, which is not always the case. This function uses a spinlock (`pch->downl`) without considering that it might be called in a process context, which leads to re-entrancy of the lock and deadlock
