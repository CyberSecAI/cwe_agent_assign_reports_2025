## Vulnerability Description
Camaleon CMS is a dynamic and advanced content management system based on Ruby on Rails. An arbitrary file write vulnerability accessible via the upload method of the MediaController allows authenticated users to write arbitrary files to any location on the web server Camaleon CMS is running on (depending on the permissions of the underlying filesystem). E.g. This can lead to a delayed remote code execution in case an attacker is able to write a Ruby file into the config/initializers/ subfolder of the Ruby on Rails application. This issue has been addressed in release version 2.8.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** arbitrary file write and remote code execution
- **vector:** upload method
- **attacker:** authenticated users
- **product:** Camaleon CMS
- **version:** before 2.8.2
- **component:** MediaController

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-46986:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-provided input used in file path construction within the `camaleon_cms` application. Specifically, the `folder` parameter provided during file uploads is directly concatenated into a file path without validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Path Traversal (CWE-22):** The application does not sanitize the `folder` parameter, allowing attackers to use `../` sequences or absolute paths to traverse the file system outside the intended upload directory.
- **Arbitrary File Write:** By controlling the destination path, an attacker can write files to any location on the server where the web server's user has write permissions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By writing malicious files, such as Ruby scripts, into sensitive directories like `config/initializers/`, an attacker can achieve remote code execution on the server after a restart.
- **Arbitrary file modification/deletion:** Depending on the attacker's goals and system permissions, they can potentially modify existing files or delete important system files.
- **Information disclosure:** An attacker might be able to write a file to any location and read from it after upload, even outside the web root.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is accessible through the `/admin/media/upload` endpoint.
- The attack is performed by crafting a POST request with a `folder` parameter containing path traversal sequences.
- An authenticated user account is required to access this endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have a valid user account on the `camaleon_cms` application.
- The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the `/admin/media/upload` endpoint.
- The attacker should have a basic understanding of HTTP requests and multipart form data.

**Additional details from the provided content (beyond the CVE description):**
- The vulnerability is located in the `MediaController` (`upload` method) and `uploader_helper` (`upload_file` method) of the `camaleon_cms` application.
- The `file_upload` parameter also plays a role, as the content of this file is what is written to the file system. The filename, however, is not directly used, so it is not related to the vulnerability.
- The `formats` parameter can be used to bypass file format validations to upload any file type.
- The provided proof of concept demonstrates how to upload a Ruby file to the `config/initializers/` directory and achieve RCE when the application is restarted.
- The advisory mentions that this vulnerability was reported through GitHub Security Lab (GHSL-2024-182).
- The advisory also includes remediation advice, recommending to sanitize input paths before using them.

The provided content gives a detailed analysis of the vulnerability, including the affected code, the exploitation steps, and the remediation advice. This goes beyond the general description of the CVE.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* 🔍 *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* 🔍 *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion – CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### 🔸 CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ✅ *“A user created with the ‘guest’ role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ✅ *“The backup service runs as root but only needs read access.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ⚠️ This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### 🔸 CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ✅ *“User can access another user’s invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.”*

## Mapping Examples – Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *“User can escalate privileges to admin.”*
> ❌ Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged – only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ✅ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**

## Good Mapping Examples – Privileges & Permissions

* ✅ **CWE-266**: *“When a new user registers, the system assigns them admin role due to a missing role validation.”*
* ✅ **CWE-250**: *“Installer runs with system-level privileges but doesn't require them to install files in the user directory.”*
* ✅ **CWE-284**: *“Inconsistent access rules between UI and backend for sensitive endpoints.”*
* ✅ **CWE-285**: *“Authorization logic fails to restrict access to finance reports based on department.”*
