## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved cachefiles flush all requests after setting CACHEFILES_DEAD In ondemand mode, when the daemon is processing an open request, if the kernel flags the cache as CACHEFILES_DEAD, the cachefiles_daemon_write() will always return -EIO, so the daemon cant pass the copen to the kernel. Then the kernel process that is waiting for the copen triggers a hung_task. Since the DEAD state is irreversible, it can only be exited by closing /dev/cachefiles. Therefore, after calling cachefiles_io_error() to mark the cache as CACHEFILES_DEAD, if in ondemand mode, flush all requests to avoid the above hungtask. We may still be able to read some of the cached data before closing the fd of /dev/cachefiles. Note that this relies on the patch that adds reference counting to the req, otherwise it may UAF.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **race condition**
- **impact:** denial of service
- **product:** Linux kernel
- **component:** cachefiles

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause lies in the interaction between the cachefiles daemon and the kernel when a cache is marked as `CACHEFILES_DEAD`. Specifically, in on-demand mode, if the kernel flags a cache as `CACHEFILES_DEAD` while the daemon is processing an open request, the `cachefiles_daemon_write()` function will always return `-EIO`. This prevents the daemon from passing the copen to the kernel, leading to a hung task in the kernel process waiting for the copen. The `CACHEFILES_DEAD` state is irreversible and can only be exited by closing `/dev/cachefiles`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Potential for Deadlock/Hung Task:** The primary vulnerability is the potential for a hung task within the kernel. When a cache is marked as dead in on-demand mode during an open request, the kernel process waiting for a copen can get stuck, resulting in a deadlock-like situation.
- **Lack of Proper Request Handling:** When an I/O error occurs and the cache is flagged as DEAD, the existing requests are not properly flushed, leading to the hung task scenario.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The most significant impact is a denial of service. The hung task prevents the kernel from proceeding, and the only resolution is to close the /dev/cachefiles, potentially impacting system stability or requiring a reboot/restart of services utilizing the affected cache.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Triggering I/O Errors:** The attack vector involves triggering I/O errors that cause the kernel to mark the cache as `CACHEFILES_DEAD`, particularly in on-demand mode while an open request is being processed. The content provided doesn't specify how to trigger such an error.
- **Exploiting Race Conditions:** While not explicitly stated, a race condition may exist where an I/O error occurs at a specific time during daemon operation that results in the deadlock.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to the cachefiles system:** The attacker needs to be in a position to interact with the cachefiles system, likely involving the ability to trigger I/O errors or manipulate cached data.
- **Ability to cause I/O errors**: The attacker needs to be able to influence the cache system to cause I/O errors to force the cache into DEAD state

**Additional Notes**
- The fix involves flushing all requests after setting `CACHEFILES_DEAD` in on-demand mode which prevents the deadlock situation.
- The fix is dependent on a previous patch that adds reference counting to requests; otherwise, a Use-After-Free (UAF) could occur.
