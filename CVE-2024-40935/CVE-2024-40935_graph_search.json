Then the kernel process that is waiting for the copen triggers a hung_task. Since the DEAD state is irreversible, it can only be exited by closing /dev/cachefiles. Therefore, after calling cachefiles_io_error() to mark the cache as CACHEFILES_DEAD, if in ondemand mode, flush all requests to avoid the above hungtask. We may still be able to read some of the cached data before closing the fd of /dev/cachefiles. Note that this relies on the patch that adds reference counting to the req, otherwise it may UAF.
