## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
**CVE-2025-2755** (PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval)

The provided content is **RELATED** to a potential vulnerability. It details a bug report (Issue #6017) concerning an out-of-bounds read in the Assimp library, specifically within the `Assimp::AC3DImporter::ConvertObjectSection` function. Here's a breakdown of the information:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Lack of validation for `src.entries` leading to an out-of-bounds read of `object.vertices`.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds read (CWE-125).
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Potential for remote code execution if an attacker can provide a malformed AC3D file that triggers the vulnerability.
*   **Attack vectors:** Malformed AC3D file.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Ability to create a specially crafted AC3D file and trick the victim into loading it with Assimp.
*   **Mitigation or fix:** Not specified in the provided content.
*   **Affected versions:** assimp>=5.4.3

The content provides more detail than a typical CVE description, including code snippets, GDB output, and a PoC using a fuzzer. It also includes instructions for building Assimp with sanitizers and running the fuzzer to reproduce the issue.
