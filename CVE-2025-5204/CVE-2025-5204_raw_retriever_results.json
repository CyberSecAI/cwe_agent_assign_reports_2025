This affects the function MDLImporterParseSkinLump_3DGS_MDL7 of the file assimp/code/AssetLib/MDL/MDLMaterialLoader.cpp. The manipulation leads to out-of-bounds read. Attacking locally is a requirement. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The project decided to collect all Fuzzer bugs in a main-issue to address them in the future.",
