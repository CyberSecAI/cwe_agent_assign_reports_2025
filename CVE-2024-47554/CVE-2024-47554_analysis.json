The org.apache.commons.io.input.XmlStreamReader class may excessively consume CPU resources when processing maliciously crafted input. This issue affects Apache Commons IO from 2.0 before 2.14.0. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.14.0 or later, which fixes the issue.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-47554:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n- The vulnerability lies in the `org.apache.commons.io.input.XmlStreamReader` class within the Apache Commons IO library. It stems from uncontrolled resource consumption when processing maliciously crafted XML input.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- The primary weakness is the lack of proper input validation or resource management within `XmlStreamReader` when parsing XML data. This allows specially crafted malicious XML to consume excessive CPU resources, leading to a denial-of-service condition.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, making the affected system or application unresponsive. The excessive resource consumption exhausts the CPU, preventing legitimate operations.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- The attack vector is through providing malicious XML input to the `XmlStreamReader` class. This could happen if an application uses `XmlStreamReader` to process untrusted XML data, possibly from external sources or user-provided input.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- An attacker needs the ability to supply malicious XML data that will be processed by a vulnerable instance of `org.apache.commons.io.input.XmlStreamReader`. The attacker does not necessarily need access to the server, the attack may be triggered by providing input data to the application.\n\n**Additional details:**\n\n- The vulnerability affects versions of Apache Commons IO prior to 2.14.0.\n- The issue was identified by CodeQL (tool).\n- The suggested mitigation is to upgrade to Apache Commons IO version 2.14.0 or later.",

The vulnerability description specifies **excessive CPU consumption**, which makes CWE-1176 a relevant, though less primary, concern. CWE-400 is chosen as primary because the description focuses on the uncontrolled nature of the resource consumption, a broader issue than just CPU inefficiency.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe1176[\"CWE-1176: Inefficient CPU Computation\"]\n    \n    cwe1176 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe400 primary\n    class cwe1176 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a maliciously crafted input that is then processed by the vulnerable `XmlStreamReader` class. This leads to **excessive CPU consumption**, which results in a denial-of-service condition.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment, based on the provided evidence, points to CWE-400 [Uncontrolled Resource Consumption] as the primary weakness. The **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases** section mentions **excessive CPU consumption**, and the **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** confirms the **root cause** as the lack of proper input validation or resource management, leading to **excessive CPU resources**, ultimately causing a denial-of-service.\n\nCWE-400 is a Class-level CWE, and while it's generally preferred to use a more specific Base or Variant level CWE, in this case, the uncontrolled nature of the resource consumption is the overarching issue. Although the excessive consumption is specifically CPU-related, the core problem is the lack of control, making CWE-400 the most appropriate primary classification.\n\nCWE-1176 [Inefficient CPU Computation] is considered a secondary CWE because the description highlights that the CPU consumption is excessive due to the nature of the crafted input and how it's processed, suggesting an element of inefficiency in the CPU usage, however, it is not the rootcause.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nAn algorithm in a product has an inefficient worst-case computational complexity that may be detrimental to system performance and can be triggered by an attacker, typically using crafted manipulations that ensure that the worst case is being reached.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-674: Uncontrolled Recursion\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly control the amount of recursion that takes place,  consuming excessive resources, such as allocated memory or the program stack.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification)\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly control situations in which an adversary can cause the product to consume or produce excessive resources without requiring the adversary to invest equivalent work or otherwise prove authorization, i.e., the adversary's influence is \"asymmetric.\"\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource, thereby enabling an actor to influence the amount of resources consumed, eventually leading to the exhaustion of available resources.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-400 is intended for incorrect behaviors in which the product is expected to track and restrict how many resources it consumes, but CWE-400 is often misused because it is conflated with the \"technical impact\" of vulnerabilities in which resource consumption occurs.
