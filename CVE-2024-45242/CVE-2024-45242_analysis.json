During the time of initial setup, the device creates an open unsecured network whose admin panel is configured with the **default credentials** of admin/admin.

This access enables the attacker to inject OS commands via shell metacharacters, resulting in arbitrary OS command execution (CWE-78).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified several candidate CWEs, including CWE-77, CWE-78, CWE-259, and CWE-306. The primary weakness is the **command injection** vulnerability. CWE-78 is selected as the primary CWE because it is a base variant of CWE-77 and is a more specific fit for the vulnerability, where OS commands are being injected. The presence of **default credentials** and **missing authentication** for the admin panel contribute to the attack vector. Therefore CWE-259 and CWE-306 are considered as secondary issues. The evidence is based on the vulnerability description which clearly states the use of **default credentials** and the possibility to inject commands.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
