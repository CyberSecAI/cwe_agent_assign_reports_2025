  "description": "This affects versions of the package opencart/opencart from 0.0.0. An **SQL Injection** issue was identified in the Divido payment extension for OpenCart, which is included by default in version 3.0.3.9. As an anonymous unauthenticated user, if the Divido payment module is installed (it does not have to be enabled), it is possible to exploit SQL injection to gain unauthorised access to the backend database. For any site which is vulnerable, any unauthenticated user could exploit this to dump the entire OpenCart database, including customer PII data.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-21514:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n- The vulnerability is a SQL Injection flaw found in the Divido payment extension within OpenCart.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input within the `order_id` parameter of the Divido payment extension. This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code.\n- **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by anonymous, unauthenticated users, provided the Divido payment module is installed (even if it's not enabled).\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Database Exposure:** Successful exploitation can allow attackers to dump the entire OpenCart database, potentially exposing sensitive data. This includes customer Personally Identifiable Information (PII).\n- **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the backend database.\n- **Data Manipulation:** It can also allow modification or deletion of data, potentially leading to complete system compromise.\n- **Service Disruption:** By using time-based SQL injection, response times can be delayed (e.g. 5 second delay mentioned in the PoC). This could be used in a denial of service attack.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Network-Based:** The attack is performed over the network via HTTP requests.\n- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability can be triggered using a specially crafted POST request to the `/index.php?route=extension/payment/divido/update` endpoint.\n- **JSON Payload:** The malicious SQL injection payload is embedded within a JSON structure in the POST request's body, specifically within the `metadata.order_id` parameter.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **No authentication:** An attacker does not need to be logged into the application.\n- **Network Access:** The attacker only requires network access to the vulnerable OpenCart instance.\n- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker must be aware of the vulnerable URL endpoint `/index.php?route=extension/payment/divido/update` and the structure of the required POST data.\n- **Divido Payment Module Installed:** The Divido payment module must be installed in OpenCart (though not necessarily enabled).\n\n**Additional details from the provided content:**\n- The vulnerability affects OpenCart versions prior to 3.0.4.0.\n- A proof-of-concept (PoC) is available demonstrating the exploit using a POST request.\n- The PoC shows that various SQL injection payloads, including boolean-based blind, error-based, and time-based blind injections, can be used.\n- The identified vulnerable code resides in the file `upload/catalog/model/extension/payment/divido.php`.\n- The Snyk analysis assigns a severity score of 8.3, classifying it as a high severity vulnerability.",

The root cause is the failure to neutralize special elements in an SQL command. |\n| CWE-306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The vulnerability is exploitable by an unauthenticated user. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary weakness is CWE-89, **Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')**. This is a base-level CWE that directly reflects the **root cause** of the vulnerability. CWE-306, **Missing Authentication for Critical Function**, is a contributing factor, as the lack of authentication allows unauthenticated users to exploit the SQL injection.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    \n    cwe89 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe306\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe89 primary\n    class cwe306 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')** (CWE-89). This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. Because there is a **Missing Authentication for Critical Function** (CWE-306), an unauthenticated user can exploit this. The impact is unauthorized access to the backend database and potential data exposure (including customer PII).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-89 because the root cause is the **failure to neutralize special elements in the SQL command**, as evidenced by the **SQL Injection** vulnerability reported in the Divido payment extension for OpenCart. This allows unauthorized database access. The evidence is strong due to the explicit mention of \"SQL Injection\" in the vulnerability description and the CVE reference link content summary.\n\nCWE-306 is also applicable because the vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users. The \"Vulnerability Description\" states: \"As an anonymous unauthenticated user...it is possible to exploit SQL injection to gain unauthorised access to the backend database.\" This indicates a **missing authentication** check.\n\nThe selection of CWE-89 and CWE-306 is at the optimal level of specificity (Base) and is supported by the evidence. Other CWEs considered, such as CWE-79 (Cross-site Scripting) and CWE-94 (Code Injection), were not directly related to the **SQL Injection** vulnerability. The relationship between CWE-89 and CWE-306 shows that the **missing authentication** allows for easier exploitation of the **SQL Injection** flaw.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.
