## Vulnerability Description
This affects versions of the package opencart/opencart from 0.0.0. An **SQL Injection** issue was identified in the Divido payment extension for OpenCart, which is included by default in version 3.0.3.9. As an anonymous unauthenticated user, if the Divido payment module is installed (it does not have to be enabled), it is possible to exploit SQL injection to gain unauthorised access to the backend database. For any site which is vulnerable, any unauthenticated user could exploit this to dump the entire OpenCart database, including customer PII data.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **SQL Injection**
- **impact:** unauthorized access to backend database
- **attacker:** anonymous unauthenticated user
- **product:** opencart/opencart
- **version:** 3.0.3.9
- **component:** Divido payment extension

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-21514:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a SQL Injection flaw found in the Divido payment extension within OpenCart.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input within the `order_id` parameter of the Divido payment extension. This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code.
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by anonymous, unauthenticated users, provided the Divido payment module is installed (even if it's not enabled).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database Exposure:** Successful exploitation can allow attackers to dump the entire OpenCart database, potentially exposing sensitive data. This includes customer Personally Identifiable Information (PII).
- **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the backend database.
- **Data Manipulation:** It can also allow modification or deletion of data, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
- **Service Disruption:** By using time-based SQL injection, response times can be delayed (e.g. 5 second delay mentioned in the PoC). This could be used in a denial of service attack.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-Based:** The attack is performed over the network via HTTP requests.
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability can be triggered using a specially crafted POST request to the `/index.php?route=extension/payment/divido/update` endpoint.
- **JSON Payload:** The malicious SQL injection payload is embedded within a JSON structure in the POST request's body, specifically within the `metadata.order_id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No authentication:** An attacker does not need to be logged into the application.
- **Network Access:** The attacker only requires network access to the vulnerable OpenCart instance.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker must be aware of the vulnerable URL endpoint `/index.php?route=extension/payment/divido/update` and the structure of the required POST data.
- **Divido Payment Module Installed:** The Divido payment module must be installed in OpenCart (though not necessarily enabled).

**Additional details from the provided content:**
- The vulnerability affects OpenCart versions prior to 3.0.4.0.
- A proof-of-concept (PoC) is available demonstrating the exploit using a POST request.
- The PoC shows that various SQL injection payloads, including boolean-based blind, error-based, and time-based blind injections, can be used.
- The identified vulnerable code resides in the file `upload/catalog/model/extension/payment/divido.php`.
- The Snyk analysis assigns a severity score of 8.3, classifying it as a high severity vulnerability.
