This can be done by various means, such as a phishing email or a malicious website.\\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need prior authentication but must be able to convince a logged-in user to trigger the malicious request.\", similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {}, 'top_cwes_by_threshold': {}}}, similarity_summary=SimilarityInsight(consensus_cwe='', top_cwes=[], confidence_levels={}, total_samples=0), analysis='', analysis_with_relationships='', criticism='', resolution='', relevant_cwes=[{'metadata': {'doc_id': '352', 'name': 'Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'rootcause:lack of CSRF protection', 'keyphrase': 'lack of CSRF protection', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'weakness:XSS', 'keyphrase': 'XSS', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'weakness:cross-site scripting', 'keyphrase': 'cross-site scripting', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'impact:Stored XSS', 'keyphrase': 'Stored XSS', 'type': 'impact'}, {'id': 'product:Navdeep Kumar Wp Login with Ajax', 'keyphrase': 'Navdeep Kumar Wp Login with Ajax', 'type': 'product'}, {'id': 'version:through 0.6', 'keyphrase': 'through 0.6', 'type': 'version'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(373.631895795348)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '434', 'name': 'Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'rootcause:lack of CSRF protection', 'keyphrase': 'lack of CSRF protection', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'weakness:XSS', 'keyphrase': 'XSS', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'weakness:cross-site scripting', 'keyphrase': 'cross-site scripting', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'impact:Stored XSS', 'keyphrase': 'Stored XSS', 'type': 'impact'}, {'id': 'product:Navdeep Kumar Wp Login with Ajax', 'keyphrase': 'Navdeep Kumar Wp Login with Ajax', 'type': 'product'}, {'id': 'version:through 0.6', 'keyphrase': 'through 0.6', 'type': 'version'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(249.29746150328356)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '862', 'name': 'Missing Authorization', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'rootcause:lack of CSRF protection', 'keyphrase': 'lack of CSRF protection', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'product:Navdeep Kumar Wp Login with Ajax', 'keyphrase': 'Navdeep Kumar Wp Login with Ajax', 'type': 'product'}, {'id': 'version:through 0.6', 'keyphrase': 'through 0.6', 'type': 'version'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(240.34770388724618)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '89', 'name': \"Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\", 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.
