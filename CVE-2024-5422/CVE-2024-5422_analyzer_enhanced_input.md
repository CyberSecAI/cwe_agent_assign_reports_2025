## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2024-5422:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the web interface that can be triggered by sending numerous requests that lead to serial interface access on the device.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The vulnerability allows an attacker to exhaust resources, rendering the device unresponsive.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Device unavailability: Successful exploitation leads to a denial of service, making the device unusable.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based: The attack is conducted through the web interface of the device via HTTP requests.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access: The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable device's web interface.
- Scripting: The attacker uses a script to send multiple file descriptor requests.

**Technical details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by repeatedly requesting a specific file ("/info/file?/application") through the web interface.
- A bash script demonstrates the exploit by sending a high number of concurrent or sequential requests to the specified file. This causes the device to open multiple file descriptors, leading to resource exhaustion and a denial of service.
