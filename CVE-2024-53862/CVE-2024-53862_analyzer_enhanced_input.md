## Vulnerability Description
Argo Workflows is an open source container-native workflow engine for orchestrating parallel jobs on Kubernetes. When using `--auth-mode=client`, Archived Workflows can be retrieved with a fake or spoofed token via the GET Workflow endpoint `/api/v1/workflows/{namespace}/{name}` or when using `--auth-mode=sso`, all Archived Workflows can be retrieved with a valid token via the GET Workflow endpoint `/api/v1/workflows/{namespace}/{name}`. No authentication is performed by the Server itself on `client` tokens. Authentication & authorization is instead delegated to the k8s API server. However, the Workflow Archive does not interact with k8s, and so any token that looks valid will be considered authenticated, even if it is not a k8s token or even if the token has no RBAC for Argo. To handle the lack of pass-through k8s authN/authZ, the Workflow Archive specifically does the equivalent of a `kubectl auth can-i` check for respective methods. In 3.5.7 and 3.5.8, the **auth check was accidentally removed** on the GET Workflow endpoints fallback to archived workflows on these lines, allowing archived workflows to be retrieved with a fake token. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.6.2 and 3.5.13.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **auth check was accidentally removed**
- **impact:** retrieve archived workflows with fake token
- **product:** Argo Workflows
- **version:** 3.5.7 and 3.5.8
- **component:** GET Workflow endpoints

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to the accidental removal of the authentication check on the GET Workflow endpoint's fallback to archived workflows. This occurred in pull requests #12736 and #13021, specifically when the code was modified to use a sqlite-based memory store for live workflows. The Workflow Archive does not interact with the k8s API server for authentication, and any token that appears valid is considered authenticated, even if it does not have the correct RBAC permissions for Argo.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Inadequate authentication and authorization on the GET Workflow endpoint for archived workflows.",
    "The system relies on token validation rather than proper authentication against the k8s API server when accessing archived workflows in `client` mode.",
    "In `sso` mode, all archived workflows are accessible to users with a valid token regardless of prior access rights.",
        "Accidental removal of auth check in the code"

  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can retrieve archived workflows using a fake or spoofed token in `client` mode. In `sso` mode, users can access all archived workflows with a valid token, even if they did not have access before archiving. This leads to unauthorized information disclosure of workflow data.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited through network access by sending a GET request to the `/api/v1/workflows/{namespace}/{name}` endpoint with an invalid or spoofed authorization token.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs network access to the Argo Workflows server. No prior privileges are required. The attacker can exploit this vulnerability from a remote location with knowledge of the API endpoint. In `client` mode the attacker needs to be able to send requests with a fake token. In `sso` mode the attacker needs to have a valid token."

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control

**Authentication**:
Determines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.

* Example phrases: "user must log in", "lack of login check", "bypasses login"
* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.

  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* – used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).

**Authorization**:
Determines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do. It decides access *after* identity is verified.

* Example phrases: "unauthorized access", "regular user can access admin panel", "role checks are missing"
* CWE relevance: use CWEs like 862, 863, 285 for authorization errors:

  * **CWE-862**: *Missing Authorization* – the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all.
  * **CWE-863**: *Incorrect Authorization* – the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).
  * **CWE-285**: *Improper Authorization* – general category for any flawed authorization logic or design.

**Access Control**:
A broader term that includes both authentication and authorization. Governs how resources are protected and who can access them under what conditions.

* CWE relevance:

  * **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* – top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear.
  * This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.

## Mapping Discussion – Common Misclassification Patterns

### 1. **CWE-306 vs CWE-862**:

* **306** is about lack of **authentication** (e.g., *no login required at all*).
* **862** is about lack of **authorization** *after* authentication (e.g., *admin check missing*).
* ✅ Example CWE-306: *“An unauthenticated attacker can invoke the password reset API.”*
* ✅ Example CWE-862: *“An authenticated user without admin privileges can delete any user account.”*

### 2. **CWE-285 vs CWE-284**:

* **285** is specific to authorization flaws – it's a better choice than 284 **if** the issue involves *improper or missing role checks*.
* **284** should be reserved for general access control issues when it’s unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.

---

## Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification

**Phrase like "unauthorized access" is not enough.**

* If you **cannot determine whether identity was checked**, assume it’s **authorization** and consider 862 or 863.
* If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** → CWE-306.
* If the **access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced**, but it's not due to missing checks, consider **CWE-284**.

---

## Good Mapping Examples

* ✅ **CWE-306**: “The endpoint `/admin/deleteUser` does not require any authentication.”
* ✅ **CWE-862**: “Any logged-in user can change any other user's email without being an admin.”
* ✅ **CWE-863**: “An admin check exists but incorrectly grants access to non-admin users.”
* ✅ **CWE-285**: “Application uses a static role check that fails when roles change dynamically.”
* ✅ **CWE-284**: “Inconsistent enforcement of access rules across services with unclear policy source.”
