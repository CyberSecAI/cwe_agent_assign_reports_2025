  "vulnerability_info": "VulnerabilityInfo(cve_id='CVE-2024-53862', description='Argo Workflows is an open source container-native workflow engine for orchestrating parallel jobs on Kubernetes. When using `--auth-mode=client`, Archived Workflows can be retrieved with a fake or spoofed token via the GET Workflow endpoint `/api/v1/workflows/{namespace}/{name}` or when using `--auth-mode=sso`, all Archived Workflows can be retrieved with a valid token via the GET Workflow endpoint `/api/v1/workflows/{namespace}/{name}`. No authentication is performed by the Server itself on `client` tokens. Authentication & authorization is instead delegated to the k8s API server. However, the Workflow Archive does not interact with k8s, and so any token that looks valid will be considered authenticated, even if it is not a k8s token or even if the token has no RBAC for Argo. To handle the lack of pass-through k8s authN/authZ, the Workflow Archive specifically does the equivalent of a `kubectl auth can-i` check for respective methods. In 3.5.7 and 3.5.8, the **auth check was accidentally removed** on the GET Workflow endpoints fallback to archived workflows on these lines, allowing archived workflows to be retrieved with a fake token.

This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-11Android ID: A-137395936\n\n- CVE-2021-22490: There is a Permission verification vulnerability in Huawei Smartphone.Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may affect the device performance.\n\n- CVE-2021-38137: Corero SecureWatch Managed Services 9.7.2.0020 does not correctly check swa-monitor and cns-monitor user\u2019s privileges, allowing a user to perform actions not belonging to his role.\n\n- CVE-2021-39119: Affected versions of Atlassian Jira Server and Data Center allow users who have watched an issue to continue receiving updates on the issue even after their Jira account is revoked, via a Broken Access Control vulnerability in the issue notification feature. The affected versions are before version 8.19.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-39138: Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Developers can use the REST API to signup users and also allow users to login anonymously. Prior to version 4.5.1, when an anonymous user is first signed up using REST, the server creates session incorrectly. Particularly, the `authProvider` field in `_Session` class under `createdWith` shows the user logged in creating a password. If a developer later depends on the `createdWith` field to provide a different level of access between a password user and anonymous user, the server incorrectly classified the session type as being created with a `password`. The server does not currently use `createdWith` to make decisions about internal functions, so if a developer is not using `createdWith` directly, they are not affected. The vulnerability only affects users who depend on `createdWith` by using it directly. The issue is patched in Parse Server version 4.5.1. As a workaround, do not use the `createdWith` Session field to make decisions if one allows anonymous login.\n\n- CVE-2021-40654: An information disclosure issue exist in D-LINK-DIR-615 B2 2.01mt. An attacker can obtain a user name and password by forging a post request to the / getcfg.php page\n\n- CVE-2021-40655: An informtion disclosure issue exists in D-LINK-DIR-605 B2 Firmware Version : 2.01MT.

Fixed in Vault and Vault Enterprise 1.7.6, 1.8.5, and 1.9.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-24842: The Bulk Datetime Change WordPress plugin before 1.12 does not enforce capability checks which allows users with Contributor roles to 1) list private post titles of other users and 2) change the posted date of other users' posts.\n\n- CVE-2021-31921: Istio before 1.8.6 and 1.9.x before 1.9.5 contains a remotely exploitable vulnerability where an external client can access unexpected services in the cluster, bypassing authorization checks, when a gateway is configured with AUTO_PASSTHROUGH routing configuration.\n\n- CVE-2021-43781: Invenio-Drafts-Resources is a submission/deposit module for Invenio, a software framework for research data management. Invenio-Drafts-Resources prior to versions 0.13.7 and 0.14.6 does not properly check permissions when a record is published. The vulnerability is exploitable in a default installation of InvenioRDM. An authenticated a user is able via REST API calls to publish draft records of other users if they know the record identifier and the draft validates (e.g. all require fields filled out). An attacker is not able to modify the data in the record, and thus e.g. *cannot* change a record from restricted to public. The problem is patched in Invenio-Drafts-Resources v0.13.7 and 0.14.6, which is part of InvenioRDM v6.0.1 and InvenioRDM v7.0 respectively.\n\n- CVE-2020-11628: An issue was discovered in EJBCA before 6.15.2.6 and 7.x before 7.3.1.2. It is intended to support restriction of available remote protocols (CMP, ACME, REST, etc.) through the system configuration. These restrictions can be bypassed by modifying the URI string from a client. (EJBCA's internal access control restrictions are still in place, and each respective protocol must be configured to allow for enrollment.)\n\n- CVE-2020-13263: An authorization issue relating to project maintainer impersonation was identified in GitLab EE 9.5 and later through 13.0.1 that could allow unauthorized users to impersonate as a maintainer to perform limited actions.\n\n- CVE-2020-15126: In parser-server from version 3.5.0 and before 4.3.0, an authenticated user using the viewer GraphQL query can by pass all read security on his User object and can also by pass all objects linked via relation or Pointer on his User object.\n\n- CVE-2020-1725: A flaw was found in keycloak before version 13.0.0. In some scenarios a user still has access to a resource after changing the role mappings in Keycloak and after expiration of the previous access token.\n\n- CVE-2020-1729: A flaw was found in SmallRye's API through version 1.6.1. The API can allow other code running within the application server to potentially obtain the ClassLoader, bypassing any permissions checks that should have been applied. The largest threat from this vulnerability is a threat to data confidentiality. This is fixed in SmallRye 1.6.2\n\n- CVE-2020-25701: If the upload course tool in Moodle was used to delete an enrollment method which did not exist or was not already enabled, the tool would erroneously enable that enrollment method. This could lead to unintended users gaining access to the course. Versions affected: 3.9 to 3.9.2, 3.8 to 3.8.5, 3.7 to 3.7.8, 3.5 to 3.5.14 and earlier unsupported versions. This is fixed in moodle 3.9.3, 3.8.6, 3.7.9, 3.5.15, and 3.10.\n\n- CVE-2020-28397: A vulnerability has been identified in SIMATIC Drive Controller family (All versions < V2.9.2), SIMATIC ET 200SP Open Controller CPU 1515SP PC2 (incl. SIPLUS variants) (All versions < V21.9), SIMATIC S7 PLCSIM Advanced (All versions > V2 < V4), SIMATIC S7-1200 CPU family (incl. SIPLUS variants) (Version V4.4), SIMATIC S7-1500 CPU family (incl. related ET200 CPUs and SIPLUS variants) (All versions > V2.5 < V2.9.2), SIMATIC S7-1500 Software Controller (All versions > V2.5 < V21.9), TIM 1531 IRC (incl. SIPLUS NET variants) (Version V2.1). Due to an incorrect authorization check in the affected component, an attacker could extract information about access protected PLC program variables over port 102/tcp from an affected device when reading multiple attributes at once.\n\n- CVE-2020-28872: An authorization bypass vulnerability in Monitorr v1.7.6m in Monitorr/assets/config/_installation/_register.php allows an unauthorized person to create valid credentials.\n\n- CVE-2020-29605: An issue was discovered in MantisBT before 2.24.4. Due to insufficient access-level checks, any logged-in user allowed to perform Group Actions can get access to the Summary fields of private Issues via bug_arr[]= in a crafted bug_actiongroup_page.php URL. (The target Issues can have Private view status, or belong to a private Project.)\n\n- CVE-2021-1144: A vulnerability in Cisco Connected Mobile Experiences (CMX) could allow a remote, authenticated attacker without administrative privileges to alter the password of any user on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of authorization checks for changing a password. An authenticated attacker without administrative privileges could exploit this vulnerability by sending a modified HTTP request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to alter the passwords of any user on the system, including an administrative user, and then impersonate that user.\n\n- CVE-2021-1539: Multiple vulnerabilities in the authorization process of Cisco ASR 5000 Series Software (StarOS) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to bypass authorization and execute a subset of CLI commands on an affected device. For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2021-1540: Multiple vulnerabilities in the authorization process of Cisco ASR 5000 Series Software (StarOS) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to bypass authorization and execute a subset of CLI commands on an affected device. For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2021-20179: A flaw was found in pki-core. An attacker who has successfully compromised a key could use this flaw to renew the corresponding certificate over and over again, as long as it is not explicitly revoked. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity.\n\n- CVE-2021-20188: A flaw was found in podman before 1.7.0. File permissions for non-root users running in a privileged container are not correctly checked. This flaw can be abused by a low-privileged user inside the container to access any other file in the container, even if owned by the root user inside the container. It does not allow to directly escape the container, though being a privileged container means that a lot of security features are disabled when running the container. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.\n\n- CVE-2021-20229: A flaw was found in PostgreSQL in versions before 13.2. This flaw allows a user with SELECT privilege on one column to craft a special query that returns all columns of the table. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality.\n\n- CVE-2021-20282: When creating a user account, it was possible to verify the account without having access to the verification email link/secret in moodle before 3.10.2, 3.9.5, 3.8.8, 3.5.17.\n\n- CVE-2021-21182: Insufficient policy enforcement in navigations in Google Chrome prior to 89.0.4389.72 allowed a remote attacker who had compromised the renderer process to bypass navigation restrictions via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-21228: Insufficient policy enforcement in extensions in Google Chrome prior to 90.0.4430.93 allowed an attacker who convinced a user to install a malicious extension to bypass navigation restrictions via a crafted Chrome Extension.\n\n- CVE-2021-21318: Opencast is a free, open-source platform to support the management of educational audio and video content. In Opencast before version 9.2 there is a vulnerability in which publishing an episode with strict access rules will overwrite the currently set series access. This allows for an easy denial of access for all users without superuser privileges, effectively hiding the series. Access to series and series metadata on the search service (shown in media module and player) depends on the events published which are part of the series. Publishing an event will automatically publish a series and update access to it. Removing an event or republishing the event should do the same. Affected versions of Opencast may not update the series access or remove a published series if an event is being removed. On removal of an episode, this may lead to an access control list for series metadata with broader access rules than the merged access rules of all remaining events, or the series metadata still being available although all episodes of that series have been removed. This problem is fixed in Opencast 9.2.\n\n- CVE-2021-21367: Switchboard Bluetooth Plug for elementary OS from version 2.3.0 and before version version 2.3.5 has an incorrect authorization vulnerability. When the Bluetooth plug is running (in discoverable mode), Bluetooth service requests and pairing requests are automatically accepted, allowing physically proximate attackers to pair with a device running an affected version of switchboard-plug-bluetooth without the active consent of the user. By default, elementary OS doesn't expose any services via Bluetooth that allow information to be extracted by paired Bluetooth devices. However, if such services (i.e. contact list sharing software) have been installed, it's possible that attackers have been able to extract data from such services without authorization. If no such services have been installed, attackers are only able to pair with a device running an affected version without authorization and then play audio out of the device or possibly present a HID device (keyboard, mouse, etc...) to control the device. As such, users should check the list of trusted/paired devices and remove any that are not 100% confirmed to be genuine. This is fixed in version 2.3.5. To reduce the likelihood of this vulnerability on an unpatched version, only open the Bluetooth plug for short intervals when absolutely necessary and preferably not in crowded public areas. To mitigate the risk entirely with unpatched versions, do not open the Bluetooth plug within switchboard at all, and use a different method for pairing devices if necessary (e.g. `bluetoothctl` CLI).\n\n- CVE-2021-21389: BuddyPress is an open source WordPress plugin to build a community site. In releases of BuddyPress from 5.0.0 before 7.2.1 it's possible for a non-privileged, regular user to obtain administrator rights by exploiting an issue in the REST API members endpoint. The vulnerability has been fixed in BuddyPress 7.2.1. Existing installations of the plugin should be updated to this version to mitigate the issue.\n\n- CVE-2021-21411: OAuth2-Proxy is an open source reverse proxy that provides authentication with Google, Github or other providers. The `--gitlab-group` flag for group-based authorization in the GitLab provider stopped working in the v7.0.0 release. Regardless of the flag settings, authorization wasn't restricted. Additionally, any authenticated users had whichever groups were set in `--gitlab-group` added to the new `X-Forwarded-Groups` header to the upstream application. While adding GitLab project based authorization support in #630, a bug was introduced where the user session's groups field was populated with the `--gitlab-group` config entries instead of pulling the individual user's group membership from the GitLab Userinfo endpoint. When the session groups where compared against the allowed groups for authorization, they matched improperly (since both lists were populated with the same data) so authorization was allowed. This impacts GitLab Provider users who relies on group membership for authorization restrictions. Any authenticated users in your GitLab environment can access your applications regardless of `--gitlab-group` membership restrictions. This is patched in v7.1.0. There is no workaround for the Group membership bug. But `--gitlab-project` can be set to use Project membership as the authorization checks instead of groups; it is not broken.\n\n- CVE-2021-21609: Jenkins 2.274 and earlier, LTS 2.263.1 and earlier does not correctly match requested URLs to the list of always accessible paths, allowing attackers without Overall/Read permission to access some URLs as if they did have Overall/Read permission.\n\n- CVE-2021-21643: Jenkins Config File Provider Plugin 3.7.0 and earlier does not correctly perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints, allowing attackers with global Job/Configure permission to enumerate system-scoped credentials IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins.\n\n- CVE-2021-21670: Jenkins 2.299 and earlier, LTS 2.289.1 and earlier allows users to cancel queue items and abort builds of jobs for which they have Item/Cancel permission even when they do not have Item/Read permission.\n\n- CVE-2021-21692: FilePath#renameTo and FilePath#moveAllChildrenTo in Jenkins 2.318 and earlier, LTS 2.303.2 and earlier only check 'read' agent-to-controller access permission on the source path, instead of 'delete'.\n\n- CVE-2021-22251: Improper validation of invited users' email address in GitLab EE affecting all versions since 12.2 allowed projects to add members with email address domain that should be blocked by group settings\n\n- CVE-2021-22389: There is a Permission Control Vulnerability in Huawei Smartphone.Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may cause certain codes to be executed.\n\n- CVE-2021-24244: An AJAX action registered by the WPBakery Page Builder (Visual Composer) Clipboard WordPress plugin before 4.5.8 did not have capability checks, allowing low privilege users, such as subscribers, to update the license options (key, email).\n\n- CVE-2021-24278: In the Redirection for Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin before 2.3.4, unauthenticated users can use the wpcf7r_get_nonce AJAX action to retrieve a valid nonce for any WordPress action/function.\n\n- CVE-2021-24279: In the Redirection for Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin before 2.3.4, low level users, such as subscribers, could use the import_from_debug AJAX action to install any plugin from the WordPress repository.\n\n- CVE-2021-24281: In the Redirection for Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin before 2.3.4, any authenticated user, such as a subscriber, could use the delete_action_post AJAX action to delete any post on a target site.\n\n- CVE-2021-24282: In the Redirection for Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin before 2.3.4, any authenticated user, such as a subscriber, could use the various AJAX actions in the plugin to do a variety of things. For example, an attacker could use wpcf7r_reset_settings to reset the plugin\u2019s settings, wpcf7r_add_action to add actions to a form, and more.\n\n- CVE-2021-24379: The Comments Like Dislike WordPress plugin before 1.1.4 allows users to like/dislike posted comments, however does not prevent them from replaying the AJAX request to add a like. This allows any user (even unauthenticated) to add unlimited like/dislike to any comment. The plugin appears to have some Restriction modes, such as Cookie Restriction, IP Restrictions, Logged In User Restriction, however, they do not prevent such attack as they only check client side\n\n- CVE-2021-24652: The PostX \u2013 Gutenberg Blocks for Post Grid WordPress plugin before 2.4.10 performs incorrect checks before allowing any logged in user to perform some ajax based requests, allowing any user to modify, delete or add ultp_options values.\n\n- CVE-2021-24717: The AutomatorWP WordPress plugin before 1.7.6 does not perform capability checks which allows users with Subscriber roles to enumerate automations, disclose title of private posts or user emails, call functions, or perform privilege escalation via Ajax actions.\n\n- CVE-2021-24742: The Logo Slider and Showcase WordPress plugin before 1.3.37 allows Editor users to update the plugin's settings via the rtWLSSettings AJAX action because it uses a nonce for authorisation instead of a capability check.\n\n- CVE-2021-24757: The Stylish Price List WordPress plugin before 6.9.0 does not perform capability checks in its spl_upload_ser_img AJAX action (available to both unauthenticated and authenticated users), which could allow unauthenticated users to upload images.\n\n- CVE-2021-24770: The Stylish Price List WordPress plugin before 6.9.1 does not perform capability checks in its spl_upload_ser_img AJAX action (available to authenticated users), which could allow any authenticated users, such as subscriber, to upload arbitrary images.\n\n- CVE-2021-25777: In JetBrains TeamCity before 2020.2.1, permissions during token removal were checked improperly.\n\n- CVE-2021-25954: In \u201cDolibarr\u201d application, 2.8.1 to 13.0.4 don\u2019t restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor. A low privileged attacker can modify the Private Note which only an administrator has rights to do, the affected field is at \u201c/adherents/note.php?id=1\u201d endpoint.\n\n- CVE-2021-26040: An issue was discovered in Joomla! 4.0.0.

While these are typically device specific ACPI properties, they can also be specified to apply to a range of devices, or even all devices. On all systems with such regions Xen failed to prevent guests from undoing/replacing such mappings (CVE-2021-28694). On AMD systems, where a discontinuous range is specified by firmware, the supposedly-excluded middle range will also be identity-mapped (CVE-2021-28695). Further, on AMD systems, upon de-assigment of a physical device from a guest, the identity mappings would be left in place, allowing a guest continued access to ranges of memory which it shouldn't have access to anymore (CVE-2021-28696).\n\n- CVE-2021-29439: The Grav admin plugin prior to version 1.10.11 does not correctly verify caller's privileges. As a consequence, users with the permission `admin.login` can install third-party plugins and their dependencies. By installing the right plugin, an attacker can obtain an arbitrary code execution primitive and elevate their privileges on the instance. The vulnerability has been addressed in version 1.10.11. As a mitigation blocking access to the `/admin` path from untrusted sources will reduce the probability of exploitation. \n\n- CVE-2021-29943: When using ConfigurableInternodeAuthHadoopPlugin for authentication, Apache Solr versions prior to 8.8.2 would forward/proxy distributed requests using server credentials instead of original client credentials. This would result in incorrect authorization resolution on the receiving hosts.\n\n- CVE-2021-30533: Insufficient policy enforcement in PopupBlocker in Google Chrome prior to 91.0.4472.77 allowed a remote attacker to bypass navigation restrictions via a crafted iframe.\n\n- CVE-2021-30534: Insufficient policy enforcement in iFrameSandbox in Google Chrome prior to 91.0.4472.77 allowed a remote attacker to bypass navigation restrictions via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-31158: In the Query Engine in Couchbase Server 6.5.x and 6.6.x through 6.6.1, Common Table Expression queries were not correctly checking the user's permissions, allowing read-access to resources beyond what those users were explicitly allowed to access.\n\n- CVE-2021-31926: AMP Application Deployment Service in CubeCoders AMP 2.1.x before 2.1.1.2 allows a remote, authenticated user to open ports in the local system firewall by crafting an HTTP(S) request directly to the applicable API endpoint (despite not having permission to make changes to the system's network configuration).\n\n- CVE-2021-33718: A vulnerability has been identified in Mendix Applications using Mendix 7 (All versions < V7.23.22), Mendix Applications using Mendix 8 (All versions < V8.18.7), Mendix Applications using Mendix 9 (All versions < V9.3.0).

For certain relaxed configurations of the $wgFileImporterRequiredRight variable, it might not validate all appropriate user rights, thus allowing a user with insufficient rights to perform operations (specifically file uploads) that they should not be allowed to perform.\n\n- CVE-2021-36230: HashiCorp Terraform Enterprise releases up to v202106-1 did not properly perform authorization checks on a subset of API requests executed using the run token, allowing privilege escalation to organization owner. Fixed in v202107-1.\n\n- CVE-2021-38312: The Gutenberg Template Library & Redux Framework plugin <= 4.2.11 for WordPress used an incorrect authorization check in the REST API endpoints registered under the \u201credux/v1/templates/\u201d REST Route in \u201credux-templates/classes/class-api.php\u201d. The `permissions_callback` used in this file only checked for the `edit_posts` capability which is granted to lower-privileged users such as contributors, allowing such users to install arbitrary plugins from the WordPress repository and edit arbitrary posts.\n\n- CVE-2021-38345: The Brizy Page Builder plugin <= 2.3.11 for WordPress used an incorrect authorization check that allowed any logged-in user accessing any endpoint in the wp-admin directory to modify the content of any existing post or page created with the Brizy editor. An identical issue was found by another researcher in Brizy <= 1.0.125 and fixed in version 1.0.126, but the vulnerability was reintroduced in version 1.0.127.\n\n- CVE-2021-39321: Version 3.3.23 of the Sassy Social Share WordPress plugin is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection via the wp_ajax_heateor_sss_import_config AJAX action due to deserialization of unvalidated user supplied inputs via the import_config function found in the ~/admin/class-sassy-social-share-admin.php file. This can be exploited by underprivileged authenticated users due to a missing capability check on the import_config function.\n\n- CVE-2021-39902: Incorrect Authorization in GitLab CE/EE 13.4 or above allows a user with guest membership in a project to modify the severity of an incident.\n\n- CVE-2021-41082: Discourse is a platform for community discussion. In affected versions any private message that includes a group had its title and participating user exposed to users that do not have access to the private messages. However, access control for the private messages was not compromised as users were not able to view the posts in the leaked private message despite seeing it in their inbox. The problematic commit was reverted around 32 minutes after it was made. Users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest commit if they are running Discourse against the `tests-passed` branch.\n\n- CVE-2021-41189: DSpace is an open source turnkey repository application. In version 7.0, any community or collection administrator can escalate their permission up to become system administrator. This vulnerability only exists in 7.0 and does not impact 6.x or below. This issue is patched in version 7.1. As a workaround, users of 7.0 may temporarily disable the ability for community or collection administrators to manage permissions or workflows settings.\n\n- CVE-2021-41230: Pomerium is an open source identity-aware access proxy. In affected versions changes to the OIDC claims of a user after initial login are not reflected in policy evaluation when using `allowed_idp_claims` as part of policy. If using `allowed_idp_claims` and a user's claims are changed, Pomerium can make incorrect authorization decisions. This issue has been resolved in v0.15.6. For users unable to upgrade clear data on `databroker` service by clearing redis or restarting the in-memory databroker to force claims to be updated.\n\n- CVE-2021-42025: A vulnerability has been identified in Mendix Applications using Mendix 8 (All versions < V8.18.13), Mendix Applications using Mendix 9 (All versions < V9.6.2). Applications built with affected versions of Mendix Studio Pro do not properly control write access for certain client actions. This could allow authenticated attackers to manipulate the content of System.FileDocument objects in some cases, regardless whether they have write access to it.\n\n- CVE-2021-42026: A vulnerability has been identified in Mendix Applications using Mendix 8 (All versions < V8.18.13), Mendix Applications using Mendix 9 (All versions < V9.6.2). Applications built with affected versions of Mendix Studio Pro do not properly control read access for certain client actions. This could allow authenticated attackers to retrieve the changedDate attribute of arbitrary objects, even when they don't have read access to them.\n\n- CVE-2021-43553: PI Vision could disclose information to a user with insufficient privileges for an AF attribute that is the child of another attribute and is configured as a Limits property.\n\n- CVE-2021-29959: When a user has already allowed a website to access microphone and camera, disabling camera sharing would not fully prevent the website from re-enabling it without an additional prompt. This was only possible if the website kept recording with the microphone until re-enabling the camera. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 89.\n\n- CVE-2021-32701: ORY Oathkeeper is an Identity & Access Proxy (IAP) and Access Control Decision API that authorizes HTTP requests based on sets of Access Rules. When you make a request to an endpoint that requires the scope `foo` using an access token granted with that `foo` scope, introspection will be valid and that token will be cached. The problem comes when a second requests to an endpoint that requires the scope `bar` is made before the cache has expired. Whether the token is granted or not to the `bar` scope, introspection will be valid. A patch will be released with `v0.38.12-beta.1`. Per default, caching is disabled for the `oauth2_introspection` authenticator. When caching is disabled, this vulnerability does not exist. The cache is checked in [`func (a *AuthenticatorOAuth2Introspection) Authenticate(...)`](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/blob/6a31df1c3779425e05db1c2a381166b087cb29a4/pipeline/authn/authenticator_oauth2_introspection.go#L152). From [`tokenFromCache()`](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/blob/6a31df1c3779425e05db1c2a381166b087cb29a4/pipeline/authn/authenticator_oauth2_introspection.go#L97) it seems that it only validates the token expiration date, but ignores whether the token has or not the proper scopes. The vulnerability was introduced in PR #424. During review, we failed to require appropriate test coverage by the submitter which is the primary reason that the vulnerability passed the review process.\n\n- CVE-2021-20538: IBM Cloud Pak for Security (CP4S) 1.5.0.0 and 1.5.0.1 could allow a user to obtain sensitive information or perform actions they should not have access to due to incorrect authorization mechanisms.

This allows an attacker to obtain access to the operating system where NeDi is installed and to all application data.\n\n- CVE-2021-32829: ZStack is open source IaaS(infrastructure as a service) software aiming to automate datacenters, managing resources of compute, storage, and networking all by APIs. Affected versions of ZStack REST API are vulnerable to post-authentication Remote Code Execution (RCE) via bypass of the Groovy shell sandbox. The REST API exposes the GET zstack/v1/batch-queries?script endpoint which is backed up by the BatchQueryAction class. Messages are represented by the APIBatchQueryMsg, dispatched to the QueryFacadeImpl facade and handled by the BatchQuery class. The HTTP request parameter script is mapped to the APIBatchQueryMsg.script property and evaluated as a Groovy script in BatchQuery.query the evaluation of the user-controlled Groovy script is sandboxed by SandboxTransformer which will apply the restrictions defined in the registered (sandbox.register()) GroovyInterceptor. Even though the sandbox heavily restricts the receiver types to a small set of allowed types, the sandbox is non effective at controlling any code placed in Java annotations and therefore vulnerable to meta-programming escapes. This issue leads to post-authenticated remote code execution. For more details see the referenced GHSL-2021-065. This issue is patched in versions 3.8.21, 3.10.8, and 4.1.0.\n\n- CVE-2020-9381: controllers/admin.js in Total.js CMS 13 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a POST to the /admin/api/widgets/ URI.

Incorrect ACL checks could allow unauthorized change of the category for an article.\n\n- CVE-2021-36749: In the Druid ingestion system, the InputSource is used for reading data from a certain data source. However, the HTTP InputSource allows authenticated users to read data from other sources than intended, such as the local file system, with the privileges of the Druid server process. This is not an elevation of privilege when users access Druid directly, since Druid also provides the Local InputSource, which allows the same level of access. But it is problematic when users interact with Druid indirectly through an application that allows users to specify the HTTP InputSource, but not the Local InputSource. In this case, users could bypass the application-level restriction by passing a file URL to the HTTP InputSource. This issue was previously mentioned as being fixed in 0.21.0 as per CVE-2021-26920 but was not fixed in 0.21.0 or 0.21.1.\n\n- CVE-2021-43560: A flaw was found in Moodle in versions 3.11 to 3.11.3, 3.10 to 3.10.7, 3.9 to 3.9.10 and earlier unsupported versions.

It incorrectly executed certain rules related to blocking accounts after account creation. Such rules would allow for user accounts to be created while blocking only the IP address used to create an account (and not the user account itself). Such rules could also be used by a nefarious, unprivileged user to catalog and enumerate any number of IP addresses related to these account creations.\n\n- CVE-2021-31554: An issue was discovered in the AbuseFilter extension for MediaWiki through 1.35.2. It improperly handled account blocks for certain automatically created MediaWiki user accounts, thus allowing nefarious users to remain unblocked.\n\n- CVE-2021-35197: In MediaWiki before 1.31.15, 1.32.x through 1.35.x before 1.35.3, and 1.36.x before 1.36.1, bots have certain unintended API access.

The affected versions are before version 8.5.13, from version 8.6.0 before 8.13.5, and from version 8.14.0 before 8.15.1.\n\n- CVE-2021-20281: It was possible for some users without permission to view other users' full names to do so via the online users block in moodle before 3.10.2, 3.9.5, 3.8.8, 3.5.17.\n\n- CVE-2020-27362: An issue exists within the SSH console of Akkadian Provisioning Manager 4.50.02 which allows a low-level privileged user to escape the web configuration file editor and escalate privileges.\n\n- CVE-2021-33335: Privilege escalation vulnerability in Liferay Portal 7.0.3 through 7.3.4, and Liferay DXP 7.1 before fix pack 20, and 7.2 before fix pack 9 allows remote authenticated users with permission to update/edit users to take over a company administrator user account by editing the company administrator user.\n\n- CVE-2021-42137: An issue was discovered in Zammad before 5.0.1. In some cases, there is improper enforcement of the privilege requirement for viewing a list of tickets that shows title, state, etc.\n\n- CVE-2021-22134: A document disclosure flaw was found in Elasticsearch versions after 7.6.0 and before 7.11.0 when Document or Field Level Security is used. Get requests do not properly apply security permissions when executing a query against a recently updated document. This affects documents that have been updated and not yet refreshed in the index. This could result in the search disclosing the existence of documents and fields the attacker should not be able to view.\n\n- CVE-2021-39163: Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and Voice over IP. In versions 1.41.0 and prior, unauthorised users can access the name, avatar, topic and number of members of a room if they know the ID of the room. This vulnerability is limited to homeservers where the vulnerable homeserver is in the room and untrusted users are permitted to create groups (communities). By default, only homeserver administrators can create groups. However, homeserver administrators can already access this information in the database or using the admin API. As a result, only homeservers where the configuration setting `enable_group_creation` has been set to `true` are impacted. Server administrators should upgrade to 1.41.1 or higher to patch the vulnerability. There are two potential workarounds. Server administrators can set `enable_group_creation` to `false` in their homeserver configuration (this is the default value) to prevent creation of groups by non-administrators. Administrators that are using a reverse proxy could, with partial loss of group functionality, block the endpoints `/_matrix/client/r0/groups/{group_id}/rooms` and `/_matrix/client/unstable/groups/{group_id}/rooms`.\n\n- CVE-2021-39164: Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and Voice over IP. In versions 1.41.0 and prior, unauthorised users can access the membership (list of members, with their display names) of a room if they know the ID of the room. The vulnerability is limited to rooms with `shared` history visibility. Furthermore, the unauthorised user must be using an account on a vulnerable homeserver that is in the room. Server administrators should upgrade to 1.41.1 or later in order to receive the patch. One workaround is available. Administrators of servers that use a reverse proxy could, with potentially unacceptable loss of functionality, block the endpoints: `/_matrix/client/r0/rooms/{room_id}/members` with `at` query parameter, and `/_matrix/client/unstable/rooms/{room_id}/members` with `at` query parameter.\n\n- CVE-2021-0472: In shouldLockKeyguard of LockTaskController.java, there is a possible way to exit App Pinning without a PIN due to a permissions bypass.

The imgcrypt function `CheckAuthorization` is supposed to check whether the current used is authorized to access an encrypted image and prevent the user from running an image that another user previously decrypted on the same system. In versions prior to 1.1.4, a failure occurs when an image with a ManifestList is used and the architecture of the local host is not the first one in the ManifestList. Only the first architecture in the list was tested, which may not have its layers available locally since it could not be run on the host architecture. Therefore, the verdict on unavailable layers was that the image could be run anticipating that image run failure would occur later due to the layers not being available. However, this verdict to allow the image to run enabled other architectures in the ManifestList to run an image without providing keys if that image had previously been decrypted. A patch has been applied to imgcrypt 1.1.4. Workarounds may include usage of different namespaces for each remote user.\n\n- CVE-2022-33174: Power Distribution Units running on Powertek firmware (multiple brands) before 3.30.30 allows remote authorization bypass in the web interface. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker must send an HTTP packet to the data retrieval interface (/cgi/get_param.cgi) with the tmpToken cookie set to an empty string followed by a semicolon.

Users of Byobu with Flarum 1.0 or 1.1 should upgrade to Flarum 1.2 or later, or evaluate the impact this issue has on your forum's users and choose to disable the extension if needed. There are no workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-41923: Grails Spring Security Core plugin is vulnerable to privilege escalation. The vulnerability allows an attacker access to one endpoint (i.e. the targeted endpoint) using the authorization requirements of a different endpoint (i.e. the donor endpoint). In some Grails framework applications, access to the targeted endpoint will be granted based on meeting the authorization requirements of the donor endpoint, which can result in a privilege escalation attack. This vulnerability has been patched in grails-spring-security-core versions 3.3.2, 4.0.5 and 5.1.1. Impacted Applications: Grails Spring Security Core plugin versions: 1.x 2.x >=3.0.0 <3.3.2 >=4.0.0 <4.0.5 >=5.0.0 <5.1.1 We strongly suggest that all Grails framework applications using the Grails Spring Security Core plugin be updated to a patched release of the plugin. Workarounds: Users should create a subclass extending one of the following classes from the `grails.plugin.springsecurity.web.access.intercept` package, depending on their security configuration: * `AnnotationFilterInvocationDefinition` * `InterceptUrlMapFilterInvocationDefinition` * `RequestmapFilterInvocationDefinition` In each case, the subclass should override the `calculateUri` method like so: ``` @Override protected String calculateUri(HttpServletRequest request) { UrlPathHelper.defaultInstance.getRequestUri(request) } ``` This should be considered a temporary measure, as the patched versions of grails-spring-security-core deprecates the `calculateUri` method. Once upgraded to a patched version of the plugin, this workaround is no longer needed. The workaround is especially important for version 2.x, as no patch is available version 2.x of the GSSC plugin.\n\n- CVE-2022-0580: Incorrect Authorization in Packagist librenms/librenms prior to 22.2.0. \n\n- CVE-2022-1223: Incorrect Authorization in GitHub repository phpipam/phpipam prior to 1.4.6. \n\n- CVE-2022-0117: Policy bypass in Blink in Google Chrome prior to 97.0.4692.71 allowed a remote attacker to leak cross-origin data via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2022-0334: A flaw was found in Moodle in versions 3.11 to 3.11.4, 3.10 to 3.10.8, 3.9 to 3.9.11 and earlier unsupported versions.

This enables token manipulation, as exploited in the wild in February 2022. NOTE: although 2022-02-17 is the vendor's vulnerability announcement date, the vulnerability will not be remediated until a major protocol upgrade occurs.\n\n- CVE-2022-36103: Talos Linux is a Linux distribution built for Kubernetes deployments. Talos worker nodes use a join token to get accepted into the Talos cluster. Due to improper validation of the request while signing a worker node CSR (certificate signing request) Talos control plane node might issue Talos API certificate which allows full access to Talos API on a control plane node. Accessing Talos API with full level access on a control plane node might reveal sensitive information which allows full level access to the cluster (Kubernetes and Talos PKI, etc.). Talos API join token is stored in the machine configuration on the worker node. When configured correctly, Kubernetes workloads don't have access to the machine configuration, but due to a misconfiguration workload might access the machine configuration and reveal the join token. This problem has been fixed in Talos 1.2.2. Enabling the Pod Security Standards mitigates the vulnerability by denying hostPath mounts and host networking by default in the baseline policy. Clusters that don't run untrusted workloads are not affected. Clusters with correct Pod Security configurations which don't allow hostPath mounts, and secure access to cloud metadata server (or machine configuration is not supplied via cloud metadata server) are not affected.\n\n- CVE-2022-46792: Hasura GraphQL Engine before 2.15.2 mishandles row-level authorization in the Update Many API for Postgres backends. The fixed versions are 2.10.2, 2.11.3, 2.12.1, 2.13.2, 2.14.1, and 2.15.2. (Versions before 2.10.0 are unaffected.)\n\n- CVE-2022-3048: Inappropriate implementation in Chrome OS lockscreen in Google Chrome on Chrome OS prior to 105.0.5195.52 allowed a local attacker to bypass lockscreen navigation restrictions via physical access to the device.\n\n- CVE-2021-30538: Insufficient policy enforcement in content security policy in Google Chrome prior to 91.0.4472.77 allowed a remote attacker to bypass content security policy via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-30539: Insufficient policy enforcement in content security policy in Google Chrome prior to 91.0.4472.77 allowed a remote attacker to bypass content security policy via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-31876: Bitcoin Core 0.12.0 through 0.21.1 does not properly implement the replacement policy specified in BIP125, which makes it easier for attackers to trigger a loss of funds, or a denial of service attack against downstream projects such as Lightning network nodes. An unconfirmed child transaction with nSequence = 0xff_ff_ff_ff, spending an unconfirmed parent with nSequence <= 0xff_ff_ff_fd, should be replaceable because there is inherited signaling by the child transaction. However, the actual PreChecks implementation does not enforce this. Instead, mempool rejects the replacement attempt of the unconfirmed child transaction.\n\n- CVE-2021-3763: A flaw was found in the Red Hat AMQ Broker management console in version 7.8 where an existing user is able to access some limited information even when the role the user is assigned to should not be allow access to the management console.

In versions 1.12.0 and 1.12.1 Istio is vulnerable to a privilege escalation attack. Users who have `CREATE` permission for `gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io` objects can escalate this privilege to create other resources that they may not have access to, such as `Pod`. This vulnerability impacts only an Alpha level feature, the Kubernetes Gateway API. This is not the same as the Istio Gateway type (gateways.networking.istio.io), which is not vulnerable. Users are advised to upgrade to resolve this issue. Users unable to upgrade should implement any of the following which will prevent this vulnerability: Remove the gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io CustomResourceDefinition, set PILOT_ENABLE_GATEWAY_API_DEPLOYMENT_CONTROLLER=true environment variable in Istiod, or remove CREATE permissions for gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io objects from untrusted users.\n\n- CVE-2022-22326: IBM Datapower Gateway 10.0.2.0 through 10.0.4.0, 10.0.1.0 through 10.0.1.5, and 2018.4.1.0 through 2018.4.1.18 could allow unauthorized viewing of logs and files due to insufficient authorization checks. IBM X-Force ID: 218856.\n\n- CVE-2022-23490: BigBlueButton is an open source web conferencing system. Versions prior to 2.4.0 expose sensitive information to Unauthorized Actors. This issue affects meetings with polls, where the attacker is a meeting participant. Subscribing to the current-poll collection does not update the client UI, but does give the attacker access to the contents of the collection, which include the individual poll responses. This issue is patched in version 2.4.0. There are no workarounds. \n\n- CVE-2022-23615: XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. In affected versions any user with SCRIPT right can save a document with the right of the current user which allow accessing API requiring programming right if the current user has programming right. This has been patched in XWiki 13.0. Users are advised to update to resolve this issue. The only known workaround is to limit SCRIPT access.\n\n- CVE-2022-23627: ArchiSteamFarm (ASF) is a C# application with primary purpose of idling Steam cards from multiple accounts simultaneously. Due to a bug in ASF code, introduced in version V5.2.2.2, the program didn't adequately verify effective access of the user sending proxy (i.e. `[Bots]`) commands. In particular, a proxy-like command sent to bot `A` targeting bot `B` has incorrectly verified user's access against bot `A` - instead of bot `B`, to which the command was originally designated. This in result allowed access to resources beyond those configured, being a security threat affecting confidentiality of other bot instances. A successful attack exploiting this bug requires a significant access granted explicitly by original owner of the ASF process prior to that, as attacker has to control at least a single bot in the process to make use of this inadequate access verification loophole. The issue is patched in ASF V5.2.2.5, V5.2.3.2 and future versions. Users are advised to update as soon as possible.\n\n- CVE-2022-23739: An incorrect authorization vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server, allowing for escalation of privileges in GraphQL API requests from GitHub Apps. This vulnerability allowed an app installed on an organization to gain access to and modify most organization-level resources that are not tied to a repository regardless of granted permissions, such as users and organization-wide projects. Resources associated with repositories were not impacted, such as repository file content, repository-specific projects, issues, or pull requests. This vulnerability affected all versions of GitHub Enterprise Server prior to 3.7.1 and was fixed in versions 3.3.16, 3.4.11, 3.5.8, 3.6.4, 3.7.1. This vulnerability was reported via the GitHub Bug Bounty program.\n\n- CVE-2022-23741: An incorrect authorization vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed a scoped user-to-server token to escalate to full admin/owner privileges.

Installations of Icinga 2 with the IDO writer enabled are affected. If you use service custom variables in role restrictions, and you regularly decommission service objects, users with said roles may still have access to a collection of content. Note that this only applies if a role has implicitly permitted access to hosts, due to permitted access to at least one of their services. If access to a host is permitted by other means, no sensible information has been disclosed to unauthorized users. This issue has been resolved in versions 2.8.6, 2.9.6 and 2.10 of Icinga Web 2.\n\n- CVE-2022-24721: CometD is a scalable comet implementation for web messaging. In any version prior to 5.0.11, 6.0.6, and 7.0.6, internal usage of Oort and Seti channels is improperly authorized, so any remote user could subscribe and publish to those channels. By subscribing to those channels, a remote user may be able to watch cluster-internal traffic that contains other users' (possibly sensitive) data. By publishing to those channels, a remote user may be able to create/modify/delete other user's data and modify the cluster structure. A fix is available in versions 5.0.11, 6.0.6, and 7.0.6. As a workaround, install a custom `SecurityPolicy` that forbids subscription and publishing to remote, non-Oort, sessions on Oort and Seti channels.\n\n- CVE-2022-2597: The Visual Portfolio, Photo Gallery & Post Grid WordPress plugin before 2.19.0 does not have proper authorisation checks in some of its REST endpoints, allowing users with a role as low as contributor to call them and inject arbitrary CSS in arbitrary saved layouts\n\n- CVE-2022-26767: The issue was addressed with additional permissions checks.

In affected versions an attacker can view any room's settings even though they are not authorized to do so. Only the room owner and administrator should be able to view a room's settings. This issue has been patched in release version 2.12.6.\n\n- CVE-2022-31107: Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. In versions 5.3 until 9.0.3, 8.5.9, 8.4.10, and 8.3.10, it is possible for a malicious user who has authorization to log into a Grafana instance via a configured OAuth IdP which provides a login name to take over the account of another user in that Grafana instance. This can occur when the malicious user is authorized to log in to Grafana via OAuth, the malicious user's external user id is not already associated with an account in Grafana, the malicious user's email address is not already associated with an account in Grafana, and the malicious user knows the Grafana username of the target user. If these conditions are met, the malicious user can set their username in the OAuth provider to that of the target user, then go through the OAuth flow to log in to Grafana. Due to the way that external and internal user accounts are linked together during login, if the conditions above are all met then the malicious user will be able to log in to the target user's Grafana account. Versions 9.0.3, 8.5.9, 8.4.10, and 8.3.10 contain a patch for this issue. As a workaround, concerned users can disable OAuth login to their Grafana instance, or ensure that all users authorized to log in via OAuth have a corresponding user account in Grafana linked to their email address.\n\n- CVE-2022-31155: Sourcegraph is an opensource code search and navigation engine. In Sourcegraph versions before 3.41.0, it is possible for an attacker to delete other users\u2019 saved searches due to a bug in the authorization check.

JDPI incorrectly classifies out-of-state asymmetric TCP flows as the dynamic-application INCONCLUSIVE instead of UNKNOWN, which is more permissive, causing the firewall to allow traffic to be forwarded that should have been denied. This issue only occurs when 'set security flow tcp-session no-syn-check' is configured on the device. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series: 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R2-S9, 18.4R3-S9; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R2-S3, 19.1R3-S6; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S7, 19.2R3-S3; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R2-S6, 19.3R3-S2; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R2-S5, 19.4R3-S3; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R2-S2, 20.1R3; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R3-S1; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R3; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R2-S1, 20.4R3; 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R1-S1, 21.1R2. This issue does not affect Juniper Networks Junos OS versions prior to 18.4R1.\n\n- CVE-2022-22167: A traffic classification vulnerability in Juniper Networks Junos OS on the SRX Series Services Gateways may allow an attacker to bypass Juniper Deep Packet Inspection (JDPI) rules and access unauthorized networks or resources, when 'no-syn-check' is enabled on the device. While JDPI correctly classifies out-of-state asymmetric TCP flows as the dynamic-application UNKNOWN, this classification is not provided to the policy module properly and hence traffic continues to use the pre-id-default-policy, which is more permissive, causing the firewall to allow traffic to be forwarded that should have been denied. This issue only occurs when 'set security flow tcp-session no-syn-check' is configured on the device. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series: 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R2-S10, 18.4R3-S10; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R3-S8; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S8, 19.2R3-S4; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R3-S3; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R3-S5; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R3-S1; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R3-S2; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R3-S1; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R2-S2, 20.4R3; 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R2-S2, 21.1R3; 21.2 versions prior to 21.2R2.

The problem is patched in `tests-passed` version 2.8.0.beta11, `beta` version 2.8.0.beta11, and `stable` version 2.7.13 of Discourse.\n\n- CVE-2022-2462: The Transposh WordPress Translation plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to sensitive information disclosure to unauthenticated users in versions up to, and including, 1.0.8.1. This is due to insufficient permissions checking on the 'tp_history' AJAX action and insufficient restriction on the data returned in the response. This makes it possible for unauthenticated users to exfiltrate usernames of individuals who have translated text.\n\n- CVE-2022-31139: UnsafeAccessor (UA) is a bridge to access jdk.internal.misc.Unsafe & sun.misc.Unsafe. Normally, if UA is loaded as a named module, the internal data of UA is protected by JVM and others can only access UA via UA's standard API. The main application can set up `SecurityCheck.AccessLimiter` for UA to limit access to UA. Starting with version 1.4.0 and prior to version 1.7.0, when `SecurityCheck.AccessLimiter` is set up, untrusted code can access UA without limitation, even when UA is loaded as a named module. This issue does not affect those for whom `SecurityCheck.AccessLimiter` is not set up. Version 1.7.0 contains a patch.\n\n- CVE-2022-31190: DSpace open source software is a repository application which provides durable access to digital resources. dspace-xmlui is a UI component for DSpace.

In stable versions prior to 2.8.12 and beta or tests-passed versions prior to 2.9.0.beta.13, under certain conditions, a user can see notifications for topics they no longer have access to. If there is sensitive information in the topic title, it will therefore have been exposed. This issue is patched in stable version 2.8.12, beta version 2.9.0.beta13, and tests-passed version 2.9.0.beta13. There are no workarounds available.\n\n- CVE-2022-42724: app/Controller/UsersController.php in MISP before 2.4.164 allows attackers to discover role names (this is information that only the site admin should have).\n\n- CVE-2021-41571: In Apache Pulsar it is possible to access data from BookKeeper that does not belong to the topics accessible by the authenticated user. The Admin API get-message-by-id requires the user to input a topic and a ledger id. The ledger id is a pointer to the data, and it is supposed to be a valid it for the topic. Authorisation controls are performed against the topic name and there is not proper validation the that ledger id is valid in the context of such ledger. So it may happen that the user is able to read from a ledger that contains data owned by another tenant. This issue affects Apache Pulsar Apache Pulsar version 2.8.0 and prior versions; Apache Pulsar version 2.7.3 and prior versions; Apache Pulsar version 2.6.4 and prior versions.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-285 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-284 (ChildOf)",

Other users could see information such as command line arguments or environment variable settings. When this data contains sensitive information such as credentials, it might allow other users to launch an attack against the product or related resources.\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2005-1387: password passed on command line\n\n- CVE-2005-2291: password passed on command line\n\n- CVE-2001-1565: username/password on command line allows local users to view via \"ps\" or other process listing programs\n\n- CVE-2004-1948: Username/password on command line allows local users to view via \"ps\" or other process listing programs.\n\n- CVE-1999-1270: PGP passphrase provided as command line argument.\n\n- CVE-2004-1058: Kernel race condition allows reading of environment variables of a process that is still spawning.\n\n- CVE-2021-32638: Code analysis product passes access tokens as a command-line parameter or through an environment variable, making them visible to other processes via the ps command.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-1753: A security flaw was found in Ansible Engine, all Ansible 2.7.x versions prior to 2.7.17, all Ansible 2.8.x versions prior to 2.8.11 and all Ansible 2.9.x versions prior to 2.9.7, when managing kubernetes using the k8s module. Sensitive parameters such as passwords and tokens are passed to kubectl from the command line, not using an environment variable or an input configuration file. This will disclose passwords and tokens from process list and no_log directive from debug module would not have any effect making these secrets being disclosed on stdout and log files.\n\n- CVE-2021-32638: Github's CodeQL action is provided to run CodeQL-based code scanning on non-GitHub CI/CD systems and requires a GitHub access token to connect to a GitHub repository. The runner and its documentation previously suggested passing the GitHub token as a command-line parameter to the process instead of reading it from a file, standard input, or an environment variable. This approach made the token visible to other processes on the same machine, for example in the output of the `ps` command. If the CI system publicly exposes the output of `ps`, for example by logging the output, then the GitHub access token can be exposed beyond the scope intended. Users of the CodeQL runner on 3rd-party systems, who are passing a GitHub token via the `--github-auth` flag, are affected. This applies to both GitHub.com and GitHub Enterprise users. Users of the CodeQL Action on GitHub Actions are not affected. The `--github-auth` flag is now considered insecure and deprecated. The undocumented `--external-repository-token` flag has been removed. To securely provide a GitHub access token to the CodeQL runner, users should **do one of the following instead**: Use the `--github-auth-stdin` flag and pass the token on the command line via standard input OR set the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable to contain the token, then call the command without passing in the token. The old flag remains present for backwards compatibility with existing workflows. If the user tries to specify an access token using the `--github-auth` flag, there is a deprecation warning printed to the terminal that directs the user to one of the above options. All CodeQL runner releases codeql-bundle-20210304 onwards contain the patches. We recommend updating to a recent version of the CodeQL runner, storing a token in your CI system's secret storage mechanism, and passing the token to the CodeQL runner using `--github-auth-stdin` or the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable. If still using the old flag, ensure that process output, such as from `ps`, is not persisted in CI logs.\n\n- CVE-2022-31238: Dell PowerScale OneFS, versions 9.0.0 up to and including 9.1.0.19, 9.2.1.12, 9.3.0.6, and 9.4.0.2, contain a process invoked with sensitive information vulnerability. A CLI user may potentially exploit this vulnerability, leading to information disclosure.\n\n- CVE-2022-30586: Gradle Enterprise through 2022.2.2 has Incorrect Access Control that leads to code execution.\n\n- CVE-2022-0235: node-fetch is vulnerable to Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n\n- CVE-2022-0851: There is a flaw in convert2rhel. When the --activationkey option is used with convert2rhel, the activation key is subsequently passed to subscription-manager via the command line, which could allow unauthorized users locally on the machine to view the activation key via the process command line via e.g. htop or ps. The specific impact varies upon the subscription, but generally this would allow an attacker to register systems purchased by the victim until discovered; a form of fraud. This could occur regardless of how the activation key is supplied to convert2rhel because it involves how convert2rhel provides it to subscription-manager.\n\n- CVE-2022-1662: In convert2rhel, there's an ansible playbook named ansible/run-convert2rhel.yml which passes the Red Hat Subscription Manager user password via the CLI to convert2rhel. This could allow unauthorized local users to view the password via the process list while convert2rhel is running. However, this ansible playbook is only an example in the upstream repository and it is not shipped in officially supported versions of convert2rhel.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-497 (ChildOf)",

In rare cases this can allow a malicious actor to authenticate as a random user in the Panel. The malicious user must target an account with two-factor authentication enabled, and then must provide a correct two-factor authentication token before being authenticated as that user. Due to a validation flaw in the logic handling user authentication during the two-factor authentication process a malicious user can trick the system into loading credentials for an arbitrary user by modifying the token sent to the server. This authentication flaw is present in the `LoginCheckpointController@__invoke` method which handles two-factor authentication for a user. This controller looks for a request input parameter called `confirmation_token` which is expected to be a 64 character random alpha-numeric string that references a value within the Panel's cache containing a `user_id` value. This value is then used to fetch the user that attempted to login, and lookup their two-factor authentication token. Due to the design of this system, any element in the cache that contains only digits could be referenced by a malicious user, and whatever value is stored at that position would be used as the `user_id`. There are a few different areas of the Panel that store values into the cache that are integers, and a user who determines what those cache keys are could pass one of those keys which would cause this code pathway to reference an arbitrary user. At its heart this is a high-risk login bypass vulnerability. However, there are a few additional conditions that must be met in order for this to be successfully executed, notably: 1.) The account referenced by the malicious cache key must have two-factor authentication enabled. An account without two-factor authentication would cause an exception to be triggered by the authentication logic, thusly exiting this authentication flow. 2.) Even if the malicious user is able to reference a valid cache key that references a valid user account with two-factor authentication, they must provide a valid two-factor authentication token. However, due to the design of this endpoint once a valid user account is found with two-factor authentication enabled there is no rate-limiting present, thusly allowing an attacker to brute force combinations until successful. This leads to a third condition that must be met: 3.) For the duration of this attack sequence the cache key being referenced must continue to exist with a valid `user_id` value. Depending on the specific key being used for this attack, this value may disappear quickly, or be changed by other random user interactions on the Panel, outside the control of the attacker. In order to mitigate this vulnerability the underlying authentication logic was changed to use an encrypted session store that the user is therefore unable to control the value of. This completely removed the use of a user-controlled value being used. In addition, the code was audited to ensure this type of vulnerability is not present elsewhere.\n\n- CVE-2021-42338: 4MOSAn GCB Doctor\u2019s login page has improper validation of Cookie, which allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to bypass authentication by code injection in cookie, and arbitrarily manipulate the system or interrupt services by upload and execution of arbitrary files.\n\n- CVE-2021-1541: Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business 220 Series Smart Switches could allow an attacker to do the following: Hijack a user session Execute arbitrary commands as a root user on the underlying operating system Conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack Conduct an HTML injection attack For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2021-41317: XSS Hunter Express before 2021-09-17 does not properly enforce authentication requirements for paths.\n\n- CVE-2021-29012: DMA Softlab Radius Manager 4.4.0 assigns the same session cookie to every admin session.

As a workaround, one may disable basic authentication.\n\n- CVE-2021-21378: Envoy is a cloud-native high-performance edge/middle/service proxy. In Envoy version 1.17.0 an attacker can bypass authentication by presenting a JWT token with an issuer that is not in the provider list when Envoy's JWT Authentication filter is configured with the `allow_missing` requirement under `requires_any` due to a mistake in implementation. Envoy's JWT Authentication filter can be configured with the `allow_missing` requirement that will be satisfied if JWT is missing (JwtMissed error) and fail if JWT is presented or invalid. Due to a mistake in implementation, a JwtUnknownIssuer error was mistakenly converted to JwtMissed when `requires_any` was configured. So if `allow_missing` was configured under `requires_any`, an attacker can bypass authentication by presenting a JWT token with an issuer that is not in the provider list. Integrity may be impacted depending on configuration if the JWT token is used to protect against writes or modifications. This regression was introduced on 2020/11/12 in PR 13839 which fixed handling `allow_missing` under RequiresAny in a JwtRequirement (see issue 13458). The AnyVerifier aggregates the children verifiers' results into a final status where JwtMissing is the default error. However, a JwtUnknownIssuer was mistakenly treated the same as a JwtMissing error and the resulting final aggregation was the default JwtMissing. As a result, `allow_missing` would allow a JWT token with an unknown issuer status. This is fixed in version 1.17.1 by PR 15194. The fix works by preferring JwtUnknownIssuer over a JwtMissing error, fixing the accidental conversion and bypass with `allow_missing`. A user could detect whether a bypass occurred if they have Envoy logs enabled with debug verbosity. Users can enable component level debug logs for JWT. The JWT filter logs will indicate that there is a request with a JWT token and a failure that the JWT token is missing.\n\n- CVE-2021-21513: Dell EMC OpenManage Server Administrator (OMSA) version 9.5 Microsoft Windows installations with Distributed Web Server (DWS) enabled configuration contains an authentication bypass vulnerability.

Malicious actor can pass step checks and potentially change the configuration of Zabbix Frontend.\n\n- CVE-2021-38647: Open Management Infrastructure Remote Code Execution Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-39064: IBM Spectrum Copy Data Management 2.2.13 and earlier has weak authentication and password rules and incorrectly handles default credentials for the Spectrum Copy Data Management Admin console. IBM X-Force ID: 214957.\n\n- CVE-2022-0996: A vulnerability was found in the 389 Directory Server that allows expired passwords to access the database to cause improper authentication.\n\n- CVE-2022-31013: Chat Server is the chat server for Vartalap, an open-source messaging application. Versions 2.3.2 until 2.6.0 suffer from a bug in validating the access token, resulting in authentication bypass. The function `this.authProvider.verifyAccessKey` is an async function, as the code is not using `await` to wait for the verification result. Every time the function responds back with success, along with an unhandled exception if the token is invalid. A patch is available in version 2.6.0.\n\n- CVE-2022-35726: Broken Authentication vulnerability in yotuwp Video Gallery plugin <= 1.3.4.5 at WordPress.\n\n- CVE-2022-36296: Broken Authentication vulnerability in JumpDEMAND Inc. ActiveDEMAND plugin <= 0.2.27 at WordPress allows unauthenticated post update/create/delete. \n\n- CVE-2022-37298: Shinken Solutions Shinken Monitoring Version 2.4.3 affected is vulnerable to Incorrect Access Control. The SafeUnpickler class found in shinken/safepickle.py implements a weak authentication scheme when unserializing objects passed from monitoring nodes to the Shinken monitoring server.\n\n- CVE-2022-45724: Incorrect Access Control in Comfast router CF-WR6110N V2.3.1 allows a remote attacker on the same network to perform any HTTP request to an unauthenticated page to force the server to generate a SESSION_ID, and using this SESSION_ID an attacker can then perform authenticated requests.\n\n- CVE-2022-1801: The Very Simple Contact Form WordPress plugin before 11.6 exposes the solution to the captcha in the rendered contact form, both as hidden input fields and as plain text in the page, making it very easy for bots to bypass the captcha check, rendering the page a likely target for spam bots.\n\n- CVE-2022-37163: Bminusl IHateToBudget v1.5.7 employs a weak password policy which allows attackers to potentially gain unauthorized access to the application via brute-force attacks. Additionally, user passwords are hashed without a salt or pepper making it much easier for tools like hashcat to crack the hashes.\n\n- CVE-2022-37164: Inoda OnTrack v3.4 employs a weak password policy which allows attackers to potentially gain unauthorized access to the application via brute-force attacks. Additionally, user passwords are hashed without a salt or pepper making it much easier for tools like hashcat to crack the hashes.\n\n- CVE-2022-28666: Broken Access Control vulnerability in YIKES Inc. Custom Product Tabs for WooCommerce plugin <= 1.7.7 at WordPress leading to &yikes-the-content-toggle option update. \n\n- CVE-2021-36369: An issue was discovered in Dropbear through 2020.81. Due to a non-RFC-compliant check of the available authentication methods in the client-side SSH code, it is possible for an SSH server to change the login process in its favor. This attack can bypass additional security measures such as FIDO2 tokens or SSH-Askpass. Thus, it allows an attacker to abuse a forwarded agent for logging on to another server unnoticed.\n\n- CVE-2021-3827: A flaw was found in keycloak, where the default ECP binding flow allows other authentication flows to be bypassed. By exploiting this behavior, an attacker can bypass the MFA authentication by sending a SOAP request with an AuthnRequest and Authorization header with the user's credentials. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality and integrity.\n\n- CVE-2021-41638: The authentication checks of the MELAG FTP Server in version 2.2.0.4 are incomplete, which allows a remote attacker to access local files only by using a valid username.\n\n- CVE-2022-0910: A downgrade from two-factor authentication to one-factor authentication vulnerability in the CGI program of Zyxel USG/ZyWALL series firmware versions 4.32 through 4.71, USG FLEX series firmware versions 4.50 through 5.21, ATP series firmware versions 4.32 through 5.21, and VPN series firmware versions 4.32 through 5.21, that could allow an authenticated attacker to bypass the second authentication phase to connect the IPsec VPN server even though the two-factor authentication (2FA) was enabled.\n\n- CVE-2022-1049: A flaw was found in the Pacemaker configuration tool (pcs). The pcs daemon was allowing expired accounts, and accounts with expired passwords to login when using PAM authentication. Therefore, unprivileged expired accounts that have been denied access could still login.\n\n- CVE-2022-1426: An issue has been discovered in GitLab affecting all versions starting from 12.6 before 14.8.6, all versions starting from 14.9 before 14.9.4, all versions starting from 14.10 before 14.10.1. GitLab was not correctly authenticating a user that had some certain amount of information which allowed an user to authenticate without a personal access token.\n\n- CVE-2022-1955: Session 1.13.0 allows an attacker with physical access to the victim's device to bypass the application's password/pin lock to access user data. This is possible due to lack of adequate security controls to prevent dynamic code manipulation.\n\n- CVE-2022-20662: A vulnerability in the smart card login authentication of Cisco Duo for macOS could allow an unauthenticated attacker with physical access to bypass authentication. This vulnerability exists because the assigned user of a smart card is not properly matched with the authenticating user. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by configuring a smart card login to bypass Duo authentication. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to use any personal identity verification (PIV) smart card for authentication, even if the smart card is not assigned to the authenticating user.\n\n- CVE-2022-22956: VMware Workspace ONE Access has two authentication bypass vulnerabilities (CVE-2022-22955 & CVE-2022-22956) in the OAuth2 ACS framework. A malicious actor may bypass the authentication mechanism and execute any operation due to exposed endpoints in the authentication framework.\n\n- CVE-2022-23501: TYPO3 is an open source PHP based web content management system. In versions prior to 8.7.49, 9.5.38, 10.4.33, 11.5.20, and 12.1.1 TYPO3 is vulnerable to Improper Authentication. Restricting frontend login to specific users, organized in different storage folders (partitions), can be bypassed. A potential attacker might use this ambiguity in usernames to get access to a different account - however, credentials must be known to the adversary. This issue is patched in versions 8.7.49 ELTS, 9.5.38 ELTS, 10.4.33, 11.5.20, 12.1.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-23600: fleet is an open source device management, built on osquery. Versions prior to 4.9.1 expose a limited ability to spoof SAML authentication with missing audience verification. This impacts deployments using SAML SSO in two specific cases: 1. A malicious or compromised Service Provider (SP) could reuse the SAML response to log into Fleet as a user -- only if the user has an account with the same email in Fleet, _and_ the user signs into the malicious SP via SAML SSO from the same Identity Provider (IdP) configured with Fleet. 2. A user with an account in Fleet could reuse a SAML response intended for another SP to log into Fleet. This is only a concern if the user is blocked from Fleet in the IdP, but continues to have an account in Fleet. If the user is blocked from the IdP entirely, this cannot be exploited. Fleet 4.9.1 resolves this issue. Users unable to upgrade should: Reduce the length of sessions on your IdP to reduce the window for malicious re-use, Limit the amount of SAML Service Providers/Applications used by user accounts with access to Fleet, and When removing access to Fleet in the IdP, delete the Fleet user from Fleet as well.\n\n- CVE-2022-24259: An incorrect check in the component cdr.php of Voipmonitor GUI before v24.96 allows unauthenticated attackers to escalate privileges via a crafted request.\n\n- CVE-2022-24883: FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). Prior to version 2.7.0, server side authentication against a `SAM` file might be successful for invalid credentials if the server has configured an invalid `SAM` file path. FreeRDP based clients are not affected. RDP server implementations using FreeRDP to authenticate against a `SAM` file are affected. Version 2.7.0 contains a fix for this issue. As a workaround, use custom authentication via `HashCallback` and/or ensure the `SAM` database path configured is valid and the application has file handles left.\n\n- CVE-2022-24885: Nextcloud Android app is the Android client for Nextcloud, a self-hosted productivity platform. Prior to version 3.19.1, users can bypass a lock on the Nextcloud app on an Android device by repeatedly reopening the app. Version 3.19.1 contains a fix for the problem. There are currently no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-24976: Atheme IRC Services before 7.2.12, when used in conjunction with InspIRCd, allows authentication bypass by ending an IRC handshake at a certain point during a challenge-response login sequence.\n\n- CVE-2022-2533: An issue has been discovered in GitLab affecting all versions starting from 12.10 before 15.1.6, all versions starting from 15.2 before 15.2.4, all versions starting from 15.3 before 15.3.2. GitLab was not performing correct authentication with some Package Registries when IP address restrictions were configured, allowing an attacker already in possession of a valid Deploy Token to misuse it from any location.\n\n- CVE-2022-2553: The authfile directive in the booth config file is ignored, preventing use of authentication in communications from node to node. As a result, nodes that do not have the correct authentication key are not prevented from communicating with other nodes in the cluster.\n\n- CVE-2022-2572: In affected versions of Octopus Server where access is managed by an external authentication provider, it was possible that the API key/keys of a disabled/deleted user were still valid after the access was revoked.\n\n- CVE-2022-26504: Improper authentication in Veeam Backup & Replication 9.5U3, 9.5U4,10.x and 11.x component used for Microsoft System Center Virtual Machine Manager (SCVMM) allows attackers execute arbitrary code via Veeam.Backup.PSManager.exe\n\n- CVE-2022-26562: An issue in provider/libserver/ECKrbAuth.cpp of Kopano Core <= v11.0.2.51 contains an issue which allows attackers to authenticate even if the user account or password is expired. It also exists in the predecessor Zarafa Collaboration Platform (ZCP) in provider/libserver/ECPamAuth.cpp of Zarafa >= 6.30 (introduced between 6.30.0 RC1e and 6.30.8 final).\n\n- CVE-2022-3477: The tagDiv Composer WordPress plugin before 3.5, required by the Newspaper WordPress theme before 12.1 and Newsmag WordPress theme before 5.2.2, does not properly implement the Facebook login feature, allowing unauthenticated attackers to login as any user by just knowing their email address\n\n- CVE-2022-36106: TYPO3 is an open source PHP based web content management system released under the GNU GPL. It has been discovered that the expiration time of a password reset link for TYPO3 backend users has never been evaluated. As a result, a password reset link could be used to perform a password reset even if the default expiry time of two hours has been exceeded. Update to TYPO3 version 10.4.32 or 11.5.16 that fix the problem. There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-36412: In Zoho ManageEngine SupportCenter Plus before 11023, V3 API requests are vulnerable to authentication bypass. (An API request may, in effect, be executed with the credentials of a user who authenticated in the past.)\n\n- CVE-2022-39238: Arvados is an open source platform for managing and analyzing biomedical big data. In versions prior to 2.4.3, when using Portable Authentication Modules (PAM) for user authentication, if a user presented valid credentials but the account is disabled or otherwise not allowed to access the host (such as an expired password), it would still be accepted for access to Arvados. Other authentication methods (LDAP, OpenID Connect) supported by Arvados are not affected by this flaw. This issue is patched in version 2.4.3. Workaround for this issue is to migrate to a different authentication method supported by Arvados, such as LDAP.\n\n- CVE-2022-39263: `@next-auth/upstash-redis-adapter` is the Upstash Redis adapter for NextAuth.js, which provides authentication for Next.js. Applications that use `next-auth` Email Provider and `@next-auth/upstash-redis-adapter` before v3.0.2 are affected by this vulnerability. The Upstash Redis adapter implementation did not check for both the identifier (email) and the token, but only checking for the identifier when verifying the token in the email callback flow. An attacker who knows about the victim's email could easily sign in as the victim, given the attacker also knows about the verification token's expired duration. The vulnerability is patched in v3.0.2. A workaround is available. Using Advanced Initialization, developers can check the requests and compare the query's token and identifier before proceeding.\n\n- CVE-2022-39355: Discourse Patreon enables syncronization between Discourse Groups and Patreon rewards. On sites with Patreon login enabled, an improper authentication vulnerability could be used to take control of a victim's forum account. This vulnerability is patched in commit number 846d012151514b35ce42a1636c7d70f6dcee879e of the discourse-patreon plugin. Out of an abundance of caution, any Discourse accounts which have logged in with an unverified-email Patreon account will be logged out and asked to verify their email address on their next login. As a workaround, disable the patreon integration and log out all users with associated Patreon accounts.\n\n- CVE-2021-3632: A flaw was found in Keycloak. This vulnerability allows anyone to register a new security device or key when there is not a device already registered for any user by using the WebAuthn password-less login flow.\n\n- CVE-2022-46170: CodeIgniter is a PHP full-stack web framework. When an application uses (1) multiple session cookies (e.g., one for user pages and one for admin pages) and (2) a session handler is set to `DatabaseHandler`, `MemcachedHandler`, or `RedisHandler`, then if an attacker gets one session cookie (e.g., one for user pages), they may be able to access pages that require another session cookie (e.g., for admin pages). This issue has been patched, please upgrade to version 4.2.11 or later. As a workaround, use only one session cookie.\n\n- CVE-2022-46316: A thread security vulnerability exists in the authentication process. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may affect data integrity, confidentiality, and availability.\n\n- CVE-2022-30034: Flower, a web UI for the Celery Python RPC framework, all versions as of 05-02-2022 is vulnerable to an OAuth authentication bypass. An attacker could then access the Flower API to discover and invoke arbitrary Celery RPC calls or deny service by shutting down Celery task nodes.\n\n- CVE-2022-30124: An improper authentication vulnerability exists in Rocket.Chat Mobile App <4.14.1.22788 that allowed an attacker with physical access to a mobile device to bypass local authentication (PIN code).\n\n- CVE-2021-43414: An issue was discovered in GNU Hurd before 0.9 20210404-9. The use of an authentication protocol in the proc server is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks, which can be exploited for local privilege escalation to get full root access.\n\n- CVE-2022-21684: Discourse is an open source discussion platform. Versions prior to 2.7.13 in `stable`, 2.8.0.beta11 in `beta`, and 2.8.0.beta11 in `tests-passed` allow some users to log in to a community before they should be able to do so. A user invited via email to a forum with `must_approve_users` enabled is going to be automatically logged in, bypassing the check that does not allow unapproved users to sign in. They will be able to do everything an approved user can do. If they logout, they cannot log back in. This issue is patched in the `stable` version 2.7.13, `beta` version 2.8.0.beta11, and `tests-passed` version 2.8.0.beta11. One may disable invites as a workaround. Administrators can increase `min_trust_level_to_allow_invite` to reduce the attack surface to more trusted users.\n\n- CVE-2022-2303: An issue has been discovered in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions before 15.0.5, all versions starting from 15.1 before 15.1.4, all versions starting from 15.2 before 15.2.1. It may be possible for group members to bypass 2FA enforcement enabled at the group level by using Resource Owner Password Credentials grant to obtain an access token without using 2FA.\n\n- CVE-2022-34908: An issue was discovered in the A4N (Aremis 4 Nomad) application 1.5.0 for Android. It possesses an authentication mechanism; however, some features do not require any token or cookie in a request. Therefore, an attacker may send a simple HTTP request to the right endpoint, and obtain authorization to retrieve application data.\n\n- CVE-2022-36755: D-Link DIR845L A1 contains a authentication vulnerability via an AUTHORIZED_GROUP=1 value, as demonstrated by a request for getcfg.php.\n\n- CVE-2022-43400: A vulnerability has been identified in Siveillance Video Mobile Server V2022 R2 (All versions < V22.2a (80)). The mobile server component of affected applications improperly handles the log in for Active Directory accounts that are part of Administrators group. This could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to access the application without a valid account.\n\n- CVE-2022-48066: An issue in the component global.so of Totolink A830R V4.1.2cu.5182 allows attackers to bypass authentication via a crafted cookie.\n\n- CVE-2022-1053: Keylime does not enforce that the agent registrar data is the same when the tenant uses it for validation of the EK and identity quote and the verifier for validating the integrity quote. This allows an attacker to use one AK, EK pair from a real TPM to pass EK validation and give the verifier an AK of a software TPM. A successful attack breaks the entire chain of trust because a not validated AK is used by the verifier. This issue is worse if the validation happens first and then the agent gets added to the verifier because the timing is easier and the verifier does not validate the regcount entry being equal to 1,\n\n- CVE-2022-45124: An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the User authentication functionality of WellinTech KingHistorian 35.01.00.05. A specially crafted network packet can lead to a disclosure of sensitive information. An attacker can sniff network traffic to leverage this vulnerability.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-287 (ChildOf)",

This is fairly common when using key-based access to resources in a multi-user context.\n\nDescription:\n\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\nExtended Details:\n\n\n\nRetrieval of a user record occurs in the system based on some key value that is under user control. The key would typically identify a user-related record stored in the system and would be used to lookup that record for presentation to the user. It is likely that an attacker would have to be an authenticated user in the system. However, the authorization process would not properly check the data access operation to ensure that the authenticated user performing the operation has sufficient entitlements to perform the requested data access, hence bypassing any other authorization checks present in the system.\n\n\nFor example, attackers can look at places where user specific data is retrieved (e.g. search screens) and determine whether the key for the item being looked up is controllable externally. The key may be a hidden field in the HTML form field, might be passed as a URL parameter or as an unencrypted cookie variable, then in each of these cases it will be possible to tamper with the key value.\n\n\nOne manifestation of this weakness is when a system uses sequential or otherwise easily-guessable session IDs that would allow one user to easily switch to another user's session and read/modify their data.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-36539: An educational application does not appropriately restrict file IDs to a particular user. The attacker can brute-force guess IDs, indicating IDOR.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-26679: vFairs 3.3 is affected by Insecure Permissions.

Several APIs on the web system display, without authorization, sensitive information such as health statements, previous bills in a specific restaurant, alcohol consumption and smoking habits. Each of the described API\u2019s, has in its URL one or more MongoDB ID which is not so simple to enumerate. However, they each receive a \u2018tiny URL\u2019 in Tabit\u2019s domain, in the form of https://tbit.be/{suffix} with suffix being a 5 characters long string containing numbers, lower- and upper-case letters. It is not so simple to enumerate them all, but really easy to find some that work and lead to a personal endpoint. This is both an example of OWASP: API4 - rate limiting and OWASP: API1 - Broken object level authorization. Furthermore, the redirect URL disclosed the MongoDB IDs discussed above, and we could use them to query other endpoints disclosing more personal information. For example: The URL https://tabitisrael.co.il/online-reservations/health-statement?orgId={org_id}&healthStatementId={health_statement_id} is used to invite friends to fill a health statement before attending the restaurant.

A sync token is used in Seafile file syncing protocol to authorize access to library data. To improve performance, the token is cached in memory in seaf-server. Upon receiving a token from sync client or SeaDrive client, the server checks whether the token exist in the cache. However, if the token exists in cache, the server doesn't check whether it's associated with the specific library in the URL. This vulnerability makes it possible to use any valid sync token to access data from any **known** library. Note that the attacker has to first find out the ID of a library which it has no access to. The library ID is a random UUID, which is not possible to be guessed. There are no workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-1949: An access control bypass vulnerability found in 389-ds-base.

Due to a bug in ASF code `POST /Api/ASF` ASF API endpoint responsible for updating global ASF config incorrectly removed `IPCPassword` from the resulting config when the caller did not specify it explicitly. Due to the above, it was possible for the user to accidentally remove `IPCPassword` security measure from his IPC interface when updating global ASF config, which exists as part of global config update functionality in ASF-ui. Removal of `IPCPassword` possesses a security risk, as unauthorized users may in result access the IPC interface after such modification. The issue is patched in ASF V5.1.2.4 and future versions. We recommend to manually verify that `IPCPassword` is specified after update, and if not, set it accordingly. In default settings, ASF is configured to allow IPC access from `localhost` only and should not affect majority of users.\n\n- CVE-2021-3282: HashiCorp Vault Enterprise 1.6.0 & 1.6.1 allowed the `remove-peer` raft operator command to be executed against DR secondaries without authentication.

Prior to version 1.10.7, FreeSWITCH does not authenticate SIP MESSAGE requests, leading to spam and message spoofing. By default, SIP requests of the type MESSAGE (RFC 3428) are not authenticated in the affected versions of FreeSWITCH. MESSAGE requests are relayed to SIP user agents registered with the FreeSWITCH server without requiring any authentication. Although this behaviour can be changed by setting the `auth-messages` parameter to `true`, it is not the default setting. Abuse of this security issue allows attackers to send SIP MESSAGE messages to any SIP user agent that is registered with the server without requiring authentication. Additionally, since no authentication is required, chat messages can be spoofed to appear to come from trusted entities. Therefore, abuse can lead to spam and enable social engineering, phishing and similar attacks. This issue is patched in version 1.10.7. Maintainers recommend that this SIP message type is authenticated by default so that FreeSWITCH administrators do not need to be explicitly set the `auth-messages` parameter. When following such a recommendation, a new parameter can be introduced to explicitly disable authentication.\n\n- CVE-2021-38412: Properly formatted POST requests to multiple resources on the HTTP and HTTPS web servers of the Digi PortServer TS 16 Rack device do not require authentication or authentication tokens.

By default, SIP requests of the type SUBSCRIBE are not authenticated in the affected versions of FreeSWITCH. Abuse of this security issue allows attackers to subscribe to user agent event notifications without the need to authenticate. This abuse poses privacy concerns and might lead to social engineering or similar attacks. For example, attackers may be able to monitor the status of target SIP extensions. Although this issue was fixed in version v1.10.6, installations upgraded to the fixed version of FreeSWITCH from an older version, may still be vulnerable if the configuration is not updated accordingly. Software upgrades do not update the configuration by default. SIP SUBSCRIBE messages should be authenticated by default so that FreeSWITCH administrators do not need to explicitly set the `auth-subscriptions` parameter. When following such a recommendation, a new parameter can be introduced to explicitly disable authentication.\n\n- CVE-2020-25566: In SapphireIMS 5.0, it is possible to take over an account by sending a request to the Save_Password form as shown in POC.

In response to CVE-2020-27839, the JWT token was moved from localStorage to an httpOnly cookie. However, token cookies are used in the body of the HTTP response for the documentation, which again makes it available to XSS.The greatest threat to the system is for confidentiality, integrity, and availability.\n\n- CVE-2021-34771: A vulnerability in the Cisco IOS XR Software CLI could allow an authenticated, local attacker to view more information than their privileges allow. This vulnerability is due to insufficient application of restrictions during the execution of a specific command. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by running a specific command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view sensitive configuration information that their privileges might not otherwise allow them to access.\n\n- CVE-2021-25122: When responding to new h2c connection requests, Apache Tomcat versions 10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.0, 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.41 and 8.5.0 to 8.5.61 could duplicate request headers and a limited amount of request body from one request to another meaning user A and user B could both see the results of user A's request.\n\n- CVE-2021-0644: In conditionallyRemoveIdentifiers of SubscriptionController.java, there is a possible way to retrieve a trackable identifier due to a missing permission check. This could lead to local information disclosure with User execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-11 Android-10Android ID: A-181053462\n\n- CVE-2020-11922: An issue was discovered in WiZ Colors A60 1.14.0. The device sends unnecessary information to the cloud controller server. Although this information is sent encrypted and has low risk in isolation, it decreases the privacy of the end user. The information sent includes the local IP address being used and the SSID of the Wi-Fi network the device is connected to. (Various resources such as wigle.net can be use for mapping of SSIDs to physical locations.)\n\n- CVE-2021-24170: The REST API endpoint get_users in the User Profile Picture WordPress plugin before 2.5.0 returned more information than was required for its functionality to users with the upload_files capability. This included password hashes, hashed user activation keys, usernames, emails, and other less sensitive information.\n\n- CVE-2021-24585: The Timetable and Event Schedule WordPress plugin before 2.4.0 outputs the Hashed Password, Username and Email Address (along other less sensitive data) of the user related to the Even Head of the Timeslot in the response when requesting the event Timeslot data with a user with the edit_posts capability. Combined with the other Unauthorised Event Timeslot Modification issue (https://wpscan.com/reports/submissions/4699/) where an arbitrary user ID can be set, this could allow low privilege users with the edit_posts capability (such as author) to retrieve sensitive User data by iterating over the user_id\n\n- CVE-2021-26566: Insertion of sensitive information into sent data vulnerability in synorelayd in Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM) before 6.2.3-25426-3 allows man-in-the-middle attackers to execute arbitrary commands via inbound QuickConnect traffic.\n\n- CVE-2021-22172: Improper authorization in GitLab 12.8+ allows a guest user in a private project to view tag data that should be inaccessible on the releases page\n\n- CVE-2021-26923: An issue was discovered in Argo CD before 1.8.4.

A compromised pod with sufficient privilege is able to reconfigure the node\u2019s IPv6 interface due to the node accepting route advertisement by default, allowing the attacker to redirect full or partial network traffic from the node to the compromised pod.\n\n- CVE-2020-14371: A credential leak vulnerability was found in Red Hat Satellite. This flaw exposes the compute resources credentials through VMs that are running on these resources in Satellite.\n\n- CVE-2021-20228: A flaw was found in the Ansible Engine 2.9.18, where sensitive info is not masked by default and is not protected by the no_log feature when using the sub-option feature of the basic.py module. This flaw allows an attacker to obtain sensitive information. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality.\n\n- CVE-2021-20331:  Specific versions of the MongoDB C# Driver may erroneously publish events containing authentication-related data to a command listener configured by an application. The published events may contain security-sensitive data when commands such as \"saslStart\", \"saslContinue\", \"isMaster\", \"createUser\", and \"updateUser\" are executed. Without due care, an application may inadvertently expose this authenticated-related information, e.g., by writing it to a log file. This issue only arises if an application enables the command listener feature (this is not enabled by default). This issue affects the MongoDB C# Driver v2.12 versions prior to and including 2.12.1. \n\n- CVE-2021-26593: In Directus 8.x through 8.8.1, an attacker can see all users in the CMS using the API /users/{id}. For each call, they get in response a lot of information about the user (such as email address, first name, and last name) but also the secret for 2FA if one exists. This secret can be regenerated. NOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer\n\n- CVE-2021-28133: Zoom through 5.5.4 sometimes allows attackers to read private information on a participant's screen, even though the participant never attempted to share the private part of their screen. When a user shares a specific application window via the Share Screen functionality, other meeting participants can briefly see contents of other application windows that were explicitly not shared. The contents of these other windows can (for instance) be seen for a short period of time when they overlay the shared window and get into focus. (An attacker can, of course, use a separate screen-recorder application, unsupported by Zoom, to save all such contents for later replays and analysis.) Depending on the unintentionally shared data, this short exposure of screen contents may be a more or less severe security issue.\n\n- CVE-2021-29483: ManageWiki is an extension to the MediaWiki project. The 'wikiconfig' API leaked the value of private configuration variables set through the ManageWiki variable to all users. This has been patched by https://github.com/miraheze/ManageWiki/compare/99f3b2c8af18...befb83c66f5b.patch. If you are unable to patch set `$wgAPIListModules['wikiconfig'] = 'ApiQueryDisabled';` or remove private config as a workaround.\n\n- CVE-2021-31545: An issue was discovered in the AbuseFilter extension for MediaWiki through 1.35.2. The page_recent_contributors leaked the existence of certain deleted MediaWiki usernames, related to rev_deleted.\n\n- CVE-2021-31549: An issue was discovered in the AbuseFilter extension for MediaWiki through 1.35.2. The Special:AbuseFilter/examine form allowed for the disclosure of suppressed MediaWiki usernames to unprivileged users.\n\n- CVE-2021-32747: Icinga Web 2 is an open source monitoring web interface, framework, and command-line interface. A vulnerability in which custom variables are exposed to unauthorized users exists between versions 2.0.0 and 2.8.2. Custom variables are user-defined keys and values on configuration objects in Icinga 2. These are commonly used to reference secrets in other configurations such as check commands to be able to authenticate with a service being checked. Icinga Web 2 displays these custom variables to logged in users with access to said hosts or services. In order to protect the secrets from being visible to anyone, it's possible to setup protection rules and blacklists in a user's role. Protection rules result in `***` being shown instead of the original value, the key will remain. Backlists will hide a custom variable entirely from the user. Besides using the UI, custom variables can also be accessed differently by using an undocumented URL parameter. By adding a parameter to the affected routes, Icinga Web 2 will show these columns additionally in the respective list. This parameter is also respected when exporting to JSON or CSV. Protection rules and blacklists however have no effect in this case. Custom variables are shown as-is in the result. The issue has been fixed in the 2.9.0, 2.8.3, and 2.7.5 releases. As a workaround, one may set up a restriction to hide hosts and services with the custom variable in question.\n\n- CVE-2020-27831: A flaw was found in Red Hat Quay, where it does not properly protect the authorization token when authorizing email addresses for repository email notifications. This flaw allows an attacker to add email addresses they do not own to repository notifications.\n\n- CVE-2021-21396: wire-server is an open-source back end for Wire, a secure collaboration platform. In wire-server from version 2021-02-16 and before version 2021-03-02, the client metadata of all users was exposed in the `GET /users/list-clients` endpoint. The endpoint could be used by any logged in user who could request client details of any other user (no connection required) as far as they can find their User ID. The exposed metadata included id, class, type, location, time, and cookie. A user on a Wire backend could use this endpoint to find registration time and location for each device for a given list of users. As a workaround, remove `/list-clients` from nginx config. This has been fixed in version 2021-03-02.\n\n- CVE-2021-21400: wire-webapp is an open-source front end for Wire, a secure collaboration platform. In wire-webapp before version 2021-03-15-production.0, when being prompted to enter the app-lock passphrase, the typed passphrase will be sent into the most recently used chat when the user does not actively give focus to the input field. Input element focus is enforced programatically in version 2021-03-15-production.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-21621: Jenkins Support Core Plugin 2.72 and earlier provides the serialized user authentication as part of the \"About user (basic authentication details only)\" information, which can include the session ID of the user creating the support bundle in some configurations.\n\n- CVE-2021-21733: The management system of ZXCDN is impacted by the information leak vulnerability. Attackers can make further analysis according to the information returned by the program, and then obtain some sensitive information.

Prior to version 4.10.4, for regular (non-LiveQuery) queries, the session token is removed from the response, but for LiveQuery payloads it is currently not. If a user has a LiveQuery subscription on the `Parse.User` class, all session tokens created during user sign-ups will be broadcast as part of the LiveQuery payload. A patch in version 4.10.4 removes session tokens from the LiveQuery payload. As a workaround, set `user.acl(new Parse.ACL())` in a beforeSave trigger to make the user private already on sign-up.\n\n- CVE-2021-41125: Scrapy is a high-level web crawling and scraping framework for Python. If you use `HttpAuthMiddleware` (i.e. the `http_user` and `http_pass` spider attributes) for HTTP authentication, all requests will expose your credentials to the request target. This includes requests generated by Scrapy components, such as `robots.txt` requests sent by Scrapy when the `ROBOTSTXT_OBEY` setting is set to `True`, or as requests reached through redirects. Upgrade to Scrapy 2.5.1 and use the new `http_auth_domain` spider attribute to control which domains are allowed to receive the configured HTTP authentication credentials. If you are using Scrapy 1.8 or a lower version, and upgrading to Scrapy 2.5.1 is not an option, you may upgrade to Scrapy 1.8.1 instead. If you cannot upgrade, set your HTTP authentication credentials on a per-request basis, using for example the `w3lib.http.basic_auth_header` function to convert your credentials into a value that you can assign to the `Authorization` header of your request, instead of defining your credentials globally using `HttpAuthMiddleware`.\n\n- CVE-2021-42089: An issue was discovered in Zammad before 4.1.1. The REST API discloses sensitive information.\n\n- CVE-2021-0602: In onCreateOptionsMenu of WifiNetworkDetailsFragment.java, there is a possible way for guest users to view and modify Wi-Fi settings for all configured APs due to a permissions bypass. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-10 Android-11Android ID: A-177573895\n\n- CVE-2021-37703: Discourse is an open-source platform for community discussion.

When a node has been copied from a protected location, users with access to the copy can see the 'copyfrom' path of the original. This also reveals the fact that the node was copied. Only the 'copyfrom' path is revealed; not its contents. Both httpd and svnserve servers are vulnerable.\n\n- CVE-2021-45310: Sangoma Technologies Corporation Switchvox Version 102409 is affected by an information disclosure vulnerability due to an improper access restriction. Users information such as first name, last name, acount id, server uuid, email address, profile image, number, timestamps, etc can be extracted by sending an unauthenticated HTTP GET request to the https://Switchvox-IP/main?cmd=invalid_browser.\n\n- CVE-2021-25118: The Yoast SEO WordPress plugin (from versions 16.7 until 17.2) discloses the full internal path of featured images in posts via the wp/v2/posts REST endpoints which could help an attacker identify other vulnerabilities or help during the exploitation of other identified vulnerabilities.\n\n- CVE-2021-38956: IBM Security Verify 10.0.0, 10.0.1.0, and 10.0.2.0 could disclose sensitive version information in HTTP response headers that could aid in further attacks against the system.

When the scs-library-client is used to pull a container image, with authentication, the HTTP Authorization header sent by the client to the library service may be incorrectly leaked to an S3 backing storage provider. This occurs in a specific flow, where the library service redirects the client to a backing S3 storage server, to perform a multi-part concurrent download. Depending on site configuration, the S3 service may be provided by a third party. An attacker with access to the S3 service may be able to extract user credentials, allowing them to impersonate the user. The vulnerable multi-part concurrent download flow, with redirect to S3, is only used when communicating with a Singularity Enterprise 1.x installation, or third party server implementing this flow. Interaction with Singularity Enterprise 2.x, and Singularity Container Services (cloud.sylabs.io), does not trigger the vulnerable flow. We encourage all users to update. Users who interact with a Singularity Enterprise 1.x installation, using a 3rd party S3 storage service, are advised to revoke and recreate their authentication tokens within Singularity Enterprise. There is no workaround available at this time.\n\n- CVE-2022-31130: Grafana is an open source observability and data visualization platform. Versions of Grafana for endpoints prior to 9.1.8 and 8.5.14 could leak authentication tokens to some destination plugins under some conditions. The vulnerability impacts data source and plugin proxy endpoints with authentication tokens. The destination plugin could receive a user's Grafana authentication token. Versions 9.1.8 and 8.5.14 contain a patch for this issue. As a workaround, do not use API keys, JWT authentication, or any HTTP Header based authentication.\n\n- CVE-2022-42132: The Test LDAP Users functionality in Liferay Portal 7.0.0 through 7.4.3.4, and Liferay DXP 7.0 fix pack 102 and earlier, 7.1 before fix pack 27, 7.2 before fix pack 17, 7.3 before update 4, and DXP 7.4 GA includes the LDAP credential in the page URL when paginating through the list of users, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers or attackers with access to the request logs to see the LDAP credential.\n\n- CVE-2022-31746: Internal URLs are protected by a secret UUID key, which could have been leaked to web page through the Referrer header. This vulnerability affects Firefox for iOS < 102.\n\n- CVE-2021-23937: A DNS proxy and possible amplification attack vulnerability in WebClientInfo of Apache Wicket allows an attacker to trigger arbitrary DNS lookups from the server when the X-Forwarded-For header is not properly sanitized. This DNS lookup can be engineered to overload an internal DNS server or to slow down request processing of the Apache Wicket application causing a possible denial of service on either the internal infrastructure or the web application itself. This issue affects Apache Wicket Apache Wicket 9.x version 9.2.0 and prior versions; Apache Wicket 8.x version 8.11.0 and prior versions; Apache Wicket 7.x version 7.17.0 and prior versions and Apache Wicket 6.x version 6.2.0 and later versions.\n\n- CVE-2022-0474: Full list of recipients from customer users in a contact field could be disclosed in notification emails event when the notification is set to be sent to each recipient individually.

Starting with version 2.2 and prior to versions 2.3.9 and 2.4-beta-1, an attacker can circumvent access controls to obtain the content of public chat messages from different meetings on the server. The attacker must be a participant in a meeting on the server. BigBlueButton versions 2.3.9 and 2.4-beta-1 contain a patch for this issue. There are currently no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-31069: NestJS Proxy is a NestJS module to decorate and proxy calls. Prior to version 0.7.0, the nestjs-proxy library did not have a way to control when Authorization headers should should be forwarded for specific backend services configured by the application developer. This could have resulted in sensitive information such as OAuth bearer access tokens being inadvertently exposed to such services that should not see them. A new feature has been introduced in the patched version of nestjs-proxy that allows application developers to opt out of forwarding the Authorization headers on a per service basis using the `forwardToken` config setting. Developers are advised to review the README for this library on Github or NPM for further details on how this configuration can be applied. This issue has been fixed in version 0.7.0 of `@finastra/nestjs-proxy`. Users of `@ffdc/nestjs-proxy` are advised that this package has been deprecated and is no longer being maintained or receiving updates. Such users should update their package.json file to use `@finastra/nestjs-proxy` instead.\n\n- CVE-2022-31070: NestJS Proxy is a NestJS module to decorate and proxy calls. Prior to version 0.7.0, the nestjs-proxy library did not have a way to block sensitive cookies (e.g. session cookies) from being forwarded to backend services configured by the application developer. This could have led to sensitive cookies being inadvertently exposed to such services that should not see them. The patched version now blocks cookies from being forwarded by default. However developers can configure an allow-list of cookie names by using the `allowedCookies` config setting. This issue has been fixed in version 0.7.0 of `@finastra/nestjs-proxy`. Users of `@ffdc/nestjs-proxy` are advised that this package has been deprecated and is no longer being maintained or receiving updates. Such users should update their package.json file to use `@finastra/nestjs-proxy` instead.\n\n- CVE-2022-3348: Just like in the previous report, an attacker could steal the account of different users. But in this case, it's a little bit more specific, because it is needed to be an editor in the same app as the victim.\n\n- CVE-2022-38113: This vulnerability discloses build and services versions in the server response header. \n\n- CVE-2022-46150: Discourse is an open-source discussion platform. Prior to version 2.8.13 of the `stable` branch and version 2.9.0.beta14 of the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches, unauthorized users may learn of the existence of hidden tags and that they have been applied to topics that they have access to. This issue is patched in version 2.8.13 of the `stable` branch and version 2.9.0.beta14 of the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches. As a workaround, use the `disable_email` site setting to disable all emails to non-staff users.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-200 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-209 (CanAlsoBe)\n\n- CWE-202 (CanAlsoBe)",

This will allow an attacker to send a NEWSCAN request to a listening agent on the network as well as receive the agent's HTTP request verifying its authtoken. In AEAgent.cpp, the agent responding back over HTTP is vulnerable to a Heap Overflow if the POST payload response is too large. The POST payload response is converted to Unicode using vswprintf. This is written to a buffer only 0x2000 bytes big. If POST payload is larger, then heap overflow will occur.\n\n- CVE-2021-20110: Due to Manage Engine Asset Explorer Agent 1.0.34 not validating HTTPS certificates, an attacker on the network can statically configure their IP address to match the Asset Explorer's Server IP address. This will allow an attacker to send a NEWSCAN request to a listening agent on the network as well as receive the agent's HTTP request verifying its authtoken. In httphandler.cpp, the agent reaching out over HTTP is vulnerable to an Integer Overflow, which can be turned into a Heap Overflow allowing for remote code execution as NT AUTHORITY/SYSTEM on the agent machine. The Integer Overflow occurs when receiving POST response from the Manage Engine server, and the agent calling \"HttpQueryInfoW\" in order to get the \"Content-Length\" size from the incoming POST request. This size is taken, but multiplied to a larger amount. If an attacker specifies a Content-Length size of 1073741823 or larger, this integer arithmetic will wrap the value back around to smaller integer, then calls \"calloc\" with this size to allocate memory. The following API \"InternetReadFile\" will copy the POST data into this buffer, which will be too small for the contents, and cause heap overflow.\n\n- CVE-2021-32728: The Nextcloud Desktop Client is a tool to synchronize files from Nextcloud Server with a computer. Clients using the Nextcloud end-to-end encryption feature download the public and private key via an API endpoint. In versions prior to 3.3.0, the Nextcloud Desktop client fails to check if a private key belongs to previously downloaded public certificate. If the Nextcloud instance serves a malicious public key, the data would be encrypted for this key and thus could be accessible to a malicious actor. This issue is fixed in Nextcloud Desktop Client version 3.3.0. There are no known workarounds aside from upgrading.\n\n- CVE-2021-20327: A specific version of the Node.js mongodb-client-encryption module does not perform correct validation of the KMS server\u2019s certificate. This vulnerability in combination with a privileged network position active MITM attack could result in interception of traffic between the Node.js driver and the KMS service rendering client-side field level encryption (CSFLE) ineffective. This issue was discovered during internal testing and affects mongodb-client-encryption module version 1.2.0, which was available from 2021-Jan-29 and deprecated in the NPM Registry on 2021-Feb-04. This vulnerability does not impact driver traffic payloads with CSFLE-supported key services from applications residing inside the AWS, GCP, and Azure nework fabrics due to compensating controls in these environments. This issue does not impact driver workloads that don\u2019t use Field Level Encryption. This issue affect MongoDB Node.js Driver mongodb-client-encryption module version 1.2.0 \n\n- CVE-2021-20732: The ATOM (ATOM - Smart life App for Android versions prior to 1.8.1 and ATOM - Smart life App for iOS versions prior to 1.8.2) does not verify server certificate properly, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to eavesdrop on encrypted communication via a crafted certificate.\n\n- CVE-2021-20833: The SNKRDUNK Market Place App for iOS versions prior to 2.2.0 does not verify server certificate properly, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to eavesdrop on and/or alter encrypted communication via a crafted certificate.\n\n- CVE-2021-21559: Dell EMC NetWorker, versions 18.x, 19.1.x, 19.2.x 19.3.x, 19.4, and 19.4.0.1 contain an Improper Certificate Validation vulnerability in the client (NetWorker Management Console) components which uses SSL encrypted connection in order to communicate with the application server. An unauthenticated attacker in the same network collision domain as the NetWorker Management Console client could potentially exploit this vulnerability to perform man-in-the-middle attacks to intercept and tamper the traffic between the client and the application server.\n\n- CVE-2021-32727: Nextcloud Android Client is the Android client for Nextcloud. Clients using the Nextcloud end-to-end encryption feature download the public and private key via an API endpoint. In versions prior to 3.16.1, the Nextcloud Android client skipped a step that involved the client checking if a private key belonged to a previously downloaded public certificate. If the Nextcloud instance served a malicious public key, the data would be encrypted for this key and thus could be accessible to a malicious actor. The vulnerability is patched in version 3.16.1. As a workaround, do not add additional end-to-end encrypted devices to a user account.\n\n- CVE-2021-3547: OpenVPN 3 Core Library version 3.6 and 3.6.1 allows a man-in-the-middle attacker to bypass the certificate authentication by issuing an unrelated server certificate using the same hostname found in the verify-x509-name option in a client configuration.\n\n- CVE-2021-20989: Fibaro Home Center 2 and Lite devices with firmware version 4.600 and older initiate SSH connections to the Fibaro cloud to provide remote access and remote support capabilities. This connection can be intercepted using DNS spoofing attack and a device initiated remote port-forward channel can be used to connect to the web management interface. Knowledge of authorization credentials to the management interface is required to perform any further actions.\n\n- CVE-2020-12053: In Unisys Stealth 3.4.x, 4.x and 5.x before 5.0.026, if certificate-based authorization is used without HTTPS, an endpoint could be authorized without a private key.\n\n- CVE-2021-3162: Docker Desktop Community before 2.5.0.0 on macOS mishandles certificate checking, leading to local privilege escalation.\n\n- CVE-2021-43882: Microsoft Defender for IoT Remote Code Execution Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2020-0601: A spoofing vulnerability exists in the way Windows CryptoAPI (Crypt32.dll) validates Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) certificates.An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by using a spoofed code-signing certificate to sign a malicious executable, making it appear the file was from a trusted, legitimate source, aka 'Windows CryptoAPI Spoofing Vulnerability'.\n\n- CVE-2021-3935: When PgBouncer is configured to use \"cert\" authentication, a man-in-the-middle attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries when a connection is first established, despite the use of TLS certificate verification and encryption. This flaw affects PgBouncer versions prior to 1.16.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-20703: Multiple vulnerabilities in Cisco Small Business RV160, RV260, RV340, and RV345 Series Routers could allow an attacker to do any of the following: Execute arbitrary code Elevate privileges Execute arbitrary commands Bypass authentication and authorization protections Fetch and run unsigned software Cause denial of service (DoS) For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2022-26923: Active Directory Domain Services Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2022-1632: An Improper Certificate Validation attack was found in Openshift. A re-encrypt Route with destinationCACertificate explicitly set to the default serviceCA skips internal Service TLS certificate validation. This flaw allows an attacker to exploit an invalid certificate, resulting in a loss of confidentiality.\n\n- CVE-2022-29482: 'Mobaoku-Auction&Flea Market' App for iOS versions prior to 5.5.16 improperly verifies server certificates, which may allow an attacker to eavesdrop on an encrypted communication via a man-in-the-middle attack.\n\n- CVE-2022-34156: 'Hulu / ????' App for iOS versions prior to 3.0.81 improperly verifies server certificates, which may allow an attacker to eavesdrop on an encrypted communication via a man-in-the-middle attack.\n\n- CVE-2022-45597: ComponentSpace.Saml2 4.4.0 Missing SSL Certificate Validation. NOTE: the vendor does not consider this a vulnerability because the report is only about use of certificates at the application layer (not the transport layer) and \"Certificates are exchanged in a controlled fashion between entities within a trust relationship. This is why self-signed certificates may be used and why validating certificates isn\u2019t as important as doing so for the transport layer certificates.\"\n\n- CVE-2022-29908: The folioupdate service in Fabasoft Cloud Enterprise Client 22.4.0043 allows Local Privilege Escalation.\n\n- CVE-2021-45035: Velneo vClient on its 28.1.3 version, does not correctly check the certificate of authenticity by default. This could allow an attacker that has access to the network to perform a MITM attack in order to obtain the user\u00b4s credentials.\n\n- CVE-2022-25640: In wolfSSL before 5.2.0, a TLS 1.3 server cannot properly enforce a requirement for mutual authentication. A client can simply omit the certificate_verify message from the handshake, and never present a certificate.\n\n- CVE-2022-31083: Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 4.10.11 and 5.2.2, the certificate in the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter not validated. As a result, authentication could potentially be bypassed by making a fake certificate accessible via certain Apple domains and providing the URL to that certificate in an authData object. Versions 4.0.11 and 5.2.2 prevent this by introducing a new `rootCertificateUrl` property to the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter which takes the URL to the root certificate of Apple's Game Center authentication certificate. If no value is set, the `rootCertificateUrl` property defaults to the URL of the current root certificate as of May 27, 2022. Keep in mind that the root certificate can change at any time and that it is the developer's responsibility to keep the root certificate URL up-to-date when using the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter. There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-287 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-287 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-322 (PeerOf)",

If the affected containers have different security contexts, this may allow sensitive information to be unintentionally shared. If you are not using containerd's CRI implementation (through one of the mechanisms described above), you are not vulnerable to this issue. If you are not launching multiple containers or Kubernetes pods from the same image which have different environment variables, you are not vulnerable to this issue. If you are not launching multiple containers or Kubernetes pods from the same image in rapid succession, you have reduced likelihood of being vulnerable to this issue This vulnerability has been fixed in containerd 1.3.10 and containerd 1.4.4. Users should update to these versions.\n\n- CVE-2021-22047: In Spring Data REST versions 3.4.0 - 3.4.13, 3.5.0 - 3.5.5, and older unsupported versions, HTTP resources implemented by custom controllers using a configured base API path and a controller type-level request mapping are additionally exposed under URIs that can potentially be exposed for unauthorized access depending on the Spring Security configuration.\n\n- CVE-2021-22550: An attacker can modify the pointers in enclave memory to overwrite arbitrary memory addresses within the secure enclave.

This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of specific CLI command parameters. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by issuing that command with specific parameters. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite the content of the configuration database and gain root-level access to an affected device.\n\n- CVE-2021-37704: PhpFastCache is a high-performance backend cache system (packagist package phpfastcache/phpfastcache). In versions before 6.1.5, 7.1.2, and 8.0.7 the `phpinfo()` can be exposed if the `/vendor` is not protected from public access. This is a rare situation today since the vendor directory is often located outside the web directory or protected via server rule (.htaccess, etc). Only the v6, v7 and v8 will be patched respectively in 8.0.7, 7.1.2, 6.1.5. Older versions such as v5, v4 are not longer supported and will **NOT** be patched. As a workaround, protect the `/vendor` directory from public access.\n\n- CVE-2020-36319: Insecure configuration of default ObjectMapper in com.vaadin:flow-server versions 3.0.0 through 3.0.5 (Vaadin 15.0.0 through 15.0.4) may expose sensitive data if the application also uses e.g. @RestController\n\n- CVE-2021-28488: Ericsson Network Manager (ENM) before 21.2 has incorrect access-control behavior (that only affects the level of access available to persons who were already granted a highly privileged role).

Affected applications insufficiently limit the access to the internal user authentication service. This could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to trigger several actions on behalf of valid user accounts.\n\n- CVE-2021-4180: An information exposure flaw in openstack-tripleo-heat-templates allows an external user to discover the internal IP or hostname. An attacker could exploit this by checking the www_authenticate_uri parameter (which is visible to all end users) in configuration files. This would give sensitive information which may aid in additional system exploitation. This flaw affects openstack-tripleo-heat-templates versions prior to 11.6.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-0815: Improper access control vulnerability in McAfee WebAdvisor Chrome and Edge browser extensions up to 8.1.0.1895 allows a remote attacker to gain access to McAfee WebAdvisor settings and other details about the user\u2019s system. This could lead to unexpected behaviors including; settings being changed, fingerprinting of the system leading to targeted scams, and not triggering the malicious software if McAfee software is detected.\n\n- CVE-2021-36710: ToaruOS 1.99.2 is affected by incorrect access control via the kernel. Improper MMU management and having a low GDT address allows it to be mapped in userland.

For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2021-1258: A vulnerability in the upgrade component of Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client could allow an authenticated, local attacker with low privileges to read arbitrary files on the underlying operating system (OS) of an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient file permission restrictions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted command from the local CLI to the application. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read arbitrary files on the underlying OS of the affected device. The attacker would need to have valid user credentials to exploit this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2021-31165: Windows Container Manager Service Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-27086: Windows Services and Controller App Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-0382: In checkSlicePermission of SliceManagerService.java, there is a possible resource exposure due to an incorrect permission check.

The Shellhooks plugin for the smart-proxy allows Foreman clients to execute actions that should be limited to the Foreman Server. This flaw allows an authenticated local attacker to access and delete limited resources and also causes a denial of service on the Foreman server. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to integrity and system availability.\n\n- CVE-2021-3469: Foreman versions before 2.3.4 and before 2.4.0 is affected by an improper authorization handling flaw. An authenticated attacker can impersonate the foreman-proxy if product enable the Puppet Certificate authority (CA) to sign certificate requests that have subject alternative names (SANs). Foreman do not enable SANs by default and `allow-authorization-extensions` is set to `false` unless user change `/etc/puppetlabs/puppetserver/conf.d/ca.conf` configuration explicitly.\n\n- CVE-2021-25410: Improper access control of a component in CallBGProvider prior to SMR JUN-2021 Release 1 allows local attackers to access arbitrary files with an escalated privilege.\n\n- CVE-2021-22176: An issue has been discovered in GitLab affecting all versions starting with 3.0.1. Improper access control allows demoted project members to access details on authored merge requests\n\n- CVE-2021-39904: An Improper Access Control vulnerability in the GraphQL API in all versions of GitLab CE/EE starting from 13.1 before 14.2.6, all versions starting from 14.3 before 14.3.4, and all versions starting from 14.4 before 14.4.1 allows a Merge Request creator to resolve discussions and apply suggestions after a project owner has locked the Merge Request\n\n- CVE-2021-0571: In ActivityTaskManagerService.startActivity() and AppTaskImpl.startActivity() of ActivityTaskManagerService.java and AppTaskImpl.java, there is possible access to restricted activities due to a permissions bypass. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-11Android ID: A-137395936\n\n- CVE-2021-22490: There is a Permission verification vulnerability in Huawei Smartphone.Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may affect the device performance.\n\n- CVE-2021-38137: Corero SecureWatch Managed Services 9.7.2.0020 does not correctly check swa-monitor and cns-monitor user\u2019s privileges, allowing a user to perform actions not belonging to his role.\n\n- CVE-2021-39119: Affected versions of Atlassian Jira Server and Data Center allow users who have watched an issue to continue receiving updates on the issue even after their Jira account is revoked, via a Broken Access Control vulnerability in the issue notification feature. The affected versions are before version 8.19.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-39138: Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Developers can use the REST API to signup users and also allow users to login anonymously. Prior to version 4.5.1, when an anonymous user is first signed up using REST, the server creates session incorrectly. Particularly, the `authProvider` field in `_Session` class under `createdWith` shows the user logged in creating a password. If a developer later depends on the `createdWith` field to provide a different level of access between a password user and anonymous user, the server incorrectly classified the session type as being created with a `password`. The server does not currently use `createdWith` to make decisions about internal functions, so if a developer is not using `createdWith` directly, they are not affected. The vulnerability only affects users who depend on `createdWith` by using it directly. The issue is patched in Parse Server version 4.5.1. As a workaround, do not use the `createdWith` Session field to make decisions if one allows anonymous login.\n\n- CVE-2021-40654: An information disclosure issue exist in D-LINK-DIR-615 B2 2.01mt. An attacker can obtain a user name and password by forging a post request to the / getcfg.php page\n\n- CVE-2021-40655: An informtion disclosure issue exists in D-LINK-DIR-605 B2 Firmware Version : 2.01MT. An attacker can obtain a user name and password by forging a post request to the / getcfg.php page\n\n- CVE-2020-25564: In SapphireIMS 5.0, it is possible to create local administrator on any client with credentials of a non-privileged user by directly accessing RemoteMgmtTaskSave (Automation Tasks) feature.\n\n- CVE-2021-43998: HashiCorp Vault and Vault Enterprise 0.11.0 up to 1.7.5 and 1.8.4 templated ACL policies would always match the first-created entity alias if multiple entity aliases exist for a specified entity and mount combination, potentially resulting in incorrect policy enforcement. Fixed in Vault and Vault Enterprise 1.7.6, 1.8.5, and 1.9.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-24842: The Bulk Datetime Change WordPress plugin before 1.12 does not enforce capability checks which allows users with Contributor roles to 1) list private post titles of other users and 2) change the posted date of other users' posts.\n\n- CVE-2021-31921: Istio before 1.8.6 and 1.9.x before 1.9.5 contains a remotely exploitable vulnerability where an external client can access unexpected services in the cluster, bypassing authorization checks, when a gateway is configured with AUTO_PASSTHROUGH routing configuration.\n\n- CVE-2021-43781: Invenio-Drafts-Resources is a submission/deposit module for Invenio, a software framework for research data management. Invenio-Drafts-Resources prior to versions 0.13.7 and 0.14.6 does not properly check permissions when a record is published. The vulnerability is exploitable in a default installation of InvenioRDM. An authenticated a user is able via REST API calls to publish draft records of other users if they know the record identifier and the draft validates (e.g. all require fields filled out). An attacker is not able to modify the data in the record, and thus e.g. *cannot* change a record from restricted to public. The problem is patched in Invenio-Drafts-Resources v0.13.7 and 0.14.6, which is part of InvenioRDM v6.0.1 and InvenioRDM v7.0 respectively.\n\n- CVE-2020-11628: An issue was discovered in EJBCA before 6.15.2.6 and 7.x before 7.3.1.2. It is intended to support restriction of available remote protocols (CMP, ACME, REST, etc.) through the system configuration. These restrictions can be bypassed by modifying the URI string from a client. (EJBCA's internal access control restrictions are still in place, and each respective protocol must be configured to allow for enrollment.)\n\n- CVE-2020-13263: An authorization issue relating to project maintainer impersonation was identified in GitLab EE 9.5 and later through 13.0.1 that could allow unauthorized users to impersonate as a maintainer to perform limited actions.\n\n- CVE-2020-15126: In parser-server from version 3.5.0 and before 4.3.0, an authenticated user using the viewer GraphQL query can by pass all read security on his User object and can also by pass all objects linked via relation or Pointer on his User object.\n\n- CVE-2020-1725: A flaw was found in keycloak before version 13.0.0. In some scenarios a user still has access to a resource after changing the role mappings in Keycloak and after expiration of the previous access token.\n\n- CVE-2020-1729: A flaw was found in SmallRye's API through version 1.6.1. The API can allow other code running within the application server to potentially obtain the ClassLoader, bypassing any permissions checks that should have been applied. The largest threat from this vulnerability is a threat to data confidentiality. This is fixed in SmallRye 1.6.2\n\n- CVE-2020-25701: If the upload course tool in Moodle was used to delete an enrollment method which did not exist or was not already enabled, the tool would erroneously enable that enrollment method. This could lead to unintended users gaining access to the course. Versions affected: 3.9 to 3.9.2, 3.8 to 3.8.5, 3.7 to 3.7.8, 3.5 to 3.5.14 and earlier unsupported versions. This is fixed in moodle 3.9.3, 3.8.6, 3.7.9, 3.5.15, and 3.10.\n\n- CVE-2020-28397: A vulnerability has been identified in SIMATIC Drive Controller family (All versions < V2.9.2), SIMATIC ET 200SP Open Controller CPU 1515SP PC2 (incl. SIPLUS variants) (All versions < V21.9), SIMATIC S7 PLCSIM Advanced (All versions > V2 < V4), SIMATIC S7-1200 CPU family (incl. SIPLUS variants) (Version V4.4), SIMATIC S7-1500 CPU family (incl. related ET200 CPUs and SIPLUS variants) (All versions > V2.5 < V2.9.2), SIMATIC S7-1500 Software Controller (All versions > V2.5 < V21.9), TIM 1531 IRC (incl. SIPLUS NET variants) (Version V2.1). Due to an incorrect authorization check in the affected component, an attacker could extract information about access protected PLC program variables over port 102/tcp from an affected device when reading multiple attributes at once.\n\n- CVE-2020-28872: An authorization bypass vulnerability in Monitorr v1.7.6m in Monitorr/assets/config/_installation/_register.php allows an unauthorized person to create valid credentials.\n\n- CVE-2020-29605: An issue was discovered in MantisBT before 2.24.4. Due to insufficient access-level checks, any logged-in user allowed to perform Group Actions can get access to the Summary fields of private Issues via bug_arr[]= in a crafted bug_actiongroup_page.php URL. (The target Issues can have Private view status, or belong to a private Project.)\n\n- CVE-2021-1144: A vulnerability in Cisco Connected Mobile Experiences (CMX) could allow a remote, authenticated attacker without administrative privileges to alter the password of any user on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of authorization checks for changing a password. An authenticated attacker without administrative privileges could exploit this vulnerability by sending a modified HTTP request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to alter the passwords of any user on the system, including an administrative user, and then impersonate that user.\n\n- CVE-2021-1539: Multiple vulnerabilities in the authorization process of Cisco ASR 5000 Series Software (StarOS) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to bypass authorization and execute a subset of CLI commands on an affected device. For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2021-1540: Multiple vulnerabilities in the authorization process of Cisco ASR 5000 Series Software (StarOS) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to bypass authorization and execute a subset of CLI commands on an affected device. For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2021-20179: A flaw was found in pki-core. An attacker who has successfully compromised a key could use this flaw to renew the corresponding certificate over and over again, as long as it is not explicitly revoked. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity.\n\n- CVE-2021-20188: A flaw was found in podman before 1.7.0. File permissions for non-root users running in a privileged container are not correctly checked. This flaw can be abused by a low-privileged user inside the container to access any other file in the container, even if owned by the root user inside the container. It does not allow to directly escape the container, though being a privileged container means that a lot of security features are disabled when running the container. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.\n\n- CVE-2021-20229: A flaw was found in PostgreSQL in versions before 13.2. This flaw allows a user with SELECT privilege on one column to craft a special query that returns all columns of the table. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality.\n\n- CVE-2021-20282: When creating a user account, it was possible to verify the account without having access to the verification email link/secret in moodle before 3.10.2, 3.9.5, 3.8.8, 3.5.17.\n\n- CVE-2021-21182: Insufficient policy enforcement in navigations in Google Chrome prior to 89.0.4389.72 allowed a remote attacker who had compromised the renderer process to bypass navigation restrictions via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-21228: Insufficient policy enforcement in extensions in Google Chrome prior to 90.0.4430.93 allowed an attacker who convinced a user to install a malicious extension to bypass navigation restrictions via a crafted Chrome Extension.\n\n- CVE-2021-21318: Opencast is a free, open-source platform to support the management of educational audio and video content. In Opencast before version 9.2 there is a vulnerability in which publishing an episode with strict access rules will overwrite the currently set series access. This allows for an easy denial of access for all users without superuser privileges, effectively hiding the series. Access to series and series metadata on the search service (shown in media module and player) depends on the events published which are part of the series. Publishing an event will automatically publish a series and update access to it. Removing an event or republishing the event should do the same. Affected versions of Opencast may not update the series access or remove a published series if an event is being removed. On removal of an episode, this may lead to an access control list for series metadata with broader access rules than the merged access rules of all remaining events, or the series metadata still being available although all episodes of that series have been removed. This problem is fixed in Opencast 9.2.\n\n- CVE-2021-21367: Switchboard Bluetooth Plug for elementary OS from version 2.3.0 and before version version 2.3.5 has an incorrect authorization vulnerability. When the Bluetooth plug is running (in discoverable mode), Bluetooth service requests and pairing requests are automatically accepted, allowing physically proximate attackers to pair with a device running an affected version of switchboard-plug-bluetooth without the active consent of the user. By default, elementary OS doesn't expose any services via Bluetooth that allow information to be extracted by paired Bluetooth devices. However, if such services (i.e. contact list sharing software) have been installed, it's possible that attackers have been able to extract data from such services without authorization. If no such services have been installed, attackers are only able to pair with a device running an affected version without authorization and then play audio out of the device or possibly present a HID device (keyboard, mouse, etc...) to control the device. As such, users should check the list of trusted/paired devices and remove any that are not 100% confirmed to be genuine. This is fixed in version 2.3.5. To reduce the likelihood of this vulnerability on an unpatched version, only open the Bluetooth plug for short intervals when absolutely necessary and preferably not in crowded public areas. To mitigate the risk entirely with unpatched versions, do not open the Bluetooth plug within switchboard at all, and use a different method for pairing devices if necessary (e.g. `bluetoothctl` CLI).\n\n- CVE-2021-21389: BuddyPress is an open source WordPress plugin to build a community site. In releases of BuddyPress from 5.0.0 before 7.2.1 it's possible for a non-privileged, regular user to obtain administrator rights by exploiting an issue in the REST API members endpoint. The vulnerability has been fixed in BuddyPress 7.2.1. Existing installations of the plugin should be updated to this version to mitigate the issue.\n\n- CVE-2021-21411: OAuth2-Proxy is an open source reverse proxy that provides authentication with Google, Github or other providers. The `--gitlab-group` flag for group-based authorization in the GitLab provider stopped working in the v7.0.0 release. Regardless of the flag settings, authorization wasn't restricted. Additionally, any authenticated users had whichever groups were set in `--gitlab-group` added to the new `X-Forwarded-Groups` header to the upstream application. While adding GitLab project based authorization support in #630, a bug was introduced where the user session's groups field was populated with the `--gitlab-group` config entries instead of pulling the individual user's group membership from the GitLab Userinfo endpoint. When the session groups where compared against the allowed groups for authorization, they matched improperly (since both lists were populated with the same data) so authorization was allowed. This impacts GitLab Provider users who relies on group membership for authorization restrictions. Any authenticated users in your GitLab environment can access your applications regardless of `--gitlab-group` membership restrictions. This is patched in v7.1.0. There is no workaround for the Group membership bug. But `--gitlab-project` can be set to use Project membership as the authorization checks instead of groups; it is not broken.\n\n- CVE-2021-21609: Jenkins 2.274 and earlier, LTS 2.263.1 and earlier does not correctly match requested URLs to the list of always accessible paths, allowing attackers without Overall/Read permission to access some URLs as if they did have Overall/Read permission.\n\n- CVE-2021-21643: Jenkins Config File Provider Plugin 3.7.0 and earlier does not correctly perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints, allowing attackers with global Job/Configure permission to enumerate system-scoped credentials IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins.\n\n- CVE-2021-21670: Jenkins 2.299 and earlier, LTS 2.289.1 and earlier allows users to cancel queue items and abort builds of jobs for which they have Item/Cancel permission even when they do not have Item/Read permission.\n\n- CVE-2021-21692: FilePath#renameTo and FilePath#moveAllChildrenTo in Jenkins 2.318 and earlier, LTS 2.303.2 and earlier only check 'read' agent-to-controller access permission on the source path, instead of 'delete'.\n\n- CVE-2021-22251: Improper validation of invited users' email address in GitLab EE affecting all versions since 12.2 allowed projects to add members with email address domain that should be blocked by group settings\n\n- CVE-2021-22389: There is a Permission Control Vulnerability in Huawei Smartphone.Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may cause certain codes to be executed.\n\n- CVE-2021-24244: An AJAX action registered by the WPBakery Page Builder (Visual Composer) Clipboard WordPress plugin before 4.5.8 did not have capability checks, allowing low privilege users, such as subscribers, to update the license options (key, email).\n\n- CVE-2021-24278: In the Redirection for Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin before 2.3.4, unauthenticated users can use the wpcf7r_get_nonce AJAX action to retrieve a valid nonce for any WordPress action/function.\n\n- CVE-2021-24279: In the Redirection for Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin before 2.3.4, low level users, such as subscribers, could use the import_from_debug AJAX action to install any plugin from the WordPress repository.\n\n- CVE-2021-24281: In the Redirection for Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin before 2.3.4, any authenticated user, such as a subscriber, could use the delete_action_post AJAX action to delete any post on a target site.\n\n- CVE-2021-24282: In the Redirection for Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin before 2.3.4, any authenticated user, such as a subscriber, could use the various AJAX actions in the plugin to do a variety of things. For example, an attacker could use wpcf7r_reset_settings to reset the plugin\u2019s settings, wpcf7r_add_action to add actions to a form, and more.\n\n- CVE-2021-24379: The Comments Like Dislike WordPress plugin before 1.1.4 allows users to like/dislike posted comments, however does not prevent them from replaying the AJAX request to add a like. This allows any user (even unauthenticated) to add unlimited like/dislike to any comment. The plugin appears to have some Restriction modes, such as Cookie Restriction, IP Restrictions, Logged In User Restriction, however, they do not prevent such attack as they only check client side\n\n- CVE-2021-24652: The PostX \u2013 Gutenberg Blocks for Post Grid WordPress plugin before 2.4.10 performs incorrect checks before allowing any logged in user to perform some ajax based requests, allowing any user to modify, delete or add ultp_options values.\n\n- CVE-2021-24717: The AutomatorWP WordPress plugin before 1.7.6 does not perform capability checks which allows users with Subscriber roles to enumerate automations, disclose title of private posts or user emails, call functions, or perform privilege escalation via Ajax actions.\n\n- CVE-2021-24742: The Logo Slider and Showcase WordPress plugin before 1.3.37 allows Editor users to update the plugin's settings via the rtWLSSettings AJAX action because it uses a nonce for authorisation instead of a capability check.\n\n- CVE-2021-24757: The Stylish Price List WordPress plugin before 6.9.0 does not perform capability checks in its spl_upload_ser_img AJAX action (available to both unauthenticated and authenticated users), which could allow unauthenticated users to upload images.\n\n- CVE-2021-24770: The Stylish Price List WordPress plugin before 6.9.1 does not perform capability checks in its spl_upload_ser_img AJAX action (available to authenticated users), which could allow any authenticated users, such as subscriber, to upload arbitrary images.\n\n- CVE-2021-25777: In JetBrains TeamCity before 2020.2.1, permissions during token removal were checked improperly.\n\n- CVE-2021-25954: In \u201cDolibarr\u201d application, 2.8.1 to 13.0.4 don\u2019t restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor. A low privileged attacker can modify the Private Note which only an administrator has rights to do, the affected field is at \u201c/adherents/note.php?id=1\u201d endpoint.\n\n- CVE-2021-26040: An issue was discovered in Joomla! 4.0.0. The media manager does not correctly check the user's permissions before executing a file deletion command.\n\n- CVE-2021-26563: Incorrect authorization vulnerability in synoagentregisterd in Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM) before 6.2.4-25553 allows local users to execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors.\n\n- CVE-2021-28661: Default SilverStripe GraphQL Server (aka silverstripe/graphql) 3.x through 3.4.1 permission checker not inherited by query subclass.\n\n- CVE-2021-28696: IOMMU page mapping issues on x86 T[his CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Both AMD and Intel allow ACPI tables to specify regions of memory which should be left untranslated, which typically means these addresses should pass the translation phase unaltered. While these are typically device specific ACPI properties, they can also be specified to apply to a range of devices, or even all devices. On all systems with such regions Xen failed to prevent guests from undoing/replacing such mappings (CVE-2021-28694). On AMD systems, where a discontinuous range is specified by firmware, the supposedly-excluded middle range will also be identity-mapped (CVE-2021-28695). Further, on AMD systems, upon de-assigment of a physical device from a guest, the identity mappings would be left in place, allowing a guest continued access to ranges of memory which it shouldn't have access to anymore (CVE-2021-28696).\n\n- CVE-2021-29439: The Grav admin plugin prior to version 1.10.11 does not correctly verify caller's privileges. As a consequence, users with the permission `admin.login` can install third-party plugins and their dependencies. By installing the right plugin, an attacker can obtain an arbitrary code execution primitive and elevate their privileges on the instance. The vulnerability has been addressed in version 1.10.11. As a mitigation blocking access to the `/admin` path from untrusted sources will reduce the probability of exploitation. \n\n- CVE-2021-29943: When using ConfigurableInternodeAuthHadoopPlugin for authentication, Apache Solr versions prior to 8.8.2 would forward/proxy distributed requests using server credentials instead of original client credentials. This would result in incorrect authorization resolution on the receiving hosts.\n\n- CVE-2021-30533: Insufficient policy enforcement in PopupBlocker in Google Chrome prior to 91.0.4472.77 allowed a remote attacker to bypass navigation restrictions via a crafted iframe.\n\n- CVE-2021-30534: Insufficient policy enforcement in iFrameSandbox in Google Chrome prior to 91.0.4472.77 allowed a remote attacker to bypass navigation restrictions via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-31158: In the Query Engine in Couchbase Server 6.5.x and 6.6.x through 6.6.1, Common Table Expression queries were not correctly checking the user's permissions, allowing read-access to resources beyond what those users were explicitly allowed to access.\n\n- CVE-2021-31926: AMP Application Deployment Service in CubeCoders AMP 2.1.x before 2.1.1.2 allows a remote, authenticated user to open ports in the local system firewall by crafting an HTTP(S) request directly to the applicable API endpoint (despite not having permission to make changes to the system's network configuration).\n\n- CVE-2021-33718: A vulnerability has been identified in Mendix Applications using Mendix 7 (All versions < V7.23.22), Mendix Applications using Mendix 8 (All versions < V8.18.7), Mendix Applications using Mendix 9 (All versions < V9.3.0). Write access checks of attributes of an object could be bypassed, if user has a write permissions to the first attribute of this object.\n\n- CVE-2021-34434: In Eclipse Mosquitto versions 2.0 to 2.0.11, when using the dynamic security plugin, if the ability for a client to make subscriptions on a topic is revoked when a durable client is offline, then existing subscriptions for that client are not revoked.\n\n- CVE-2021-35949: The shareinfo controller in the ownCloud Server before 10.8.0 allows an attacker to bypass the permission checks for upload only shares and list metadata about the share.\n\n- CVE-2021-36132: An issue was discovered in the FileImporter extension in MediaWiki through 1.36. For certain relaxed configurations of the $wgFileImporterRequiredRight variable, it might not validate all appropriate user rights, thus allowing a user with insufficient rights to perform operations (specifically file uploads) that they should not be allowed to perform.\n\n- CVE-2021-36230: HashiCorp Terraform Enterprise releases up to v202106-1 did not properly perform authorization checks on a subset of API requests executed using the run token, allowing privilege escalation to organization owner. Fixed in v202107-1.\n\n- CVE-2021-38312: The Gutenberg Template Library & Redux Framework plugin <= 4.2.11 for WordPress used an incorrect authorization check in the REST API endpoints registered under the \u201credux/v1/templates/\u201d REST Route in \u201credux-templates/classes/class-api.php\u201d. The `permissions_callback` used in this file only checked for the `edit_posts` capability which is granted to lower-privileged users such as contributors, allowing such users to install arbitrary plugins from the WordPress repository and edit arbitrary posts.\n\n- CVE-2021-38345: The Brizy Page Builder plugin <= 2.3.11 for WordPress used an incorrect authorization check that allowed any logged-in user accessing any endpoint in the wp-admin directory to modify the content of any existing post or page created with the Brizy editor. An identical issue was found by another researcher in Brizy <= 1.0.125 and fixed in version 1.0.126, but the vulnerability was reintroduced in version 1.0.127.\n\n- CVE-2021-39321: Version 3.3.23 of the Sassy Social Share WordPress plugin is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection via the wp_ajax_heateor_sss_import_config AJAX action due to deserialization of unvalidated user supplied inputs via the import_config function found in the ~/admin/class-sassy-social-share-admin.php file. This can be exploited by underprivileged authenticated users due to a missing capability check on the import_config function.\n\n- CVE-2021-39902: Incorrect Authorization in GitLab CE/EE 13.4 or above allows a user with guest membership in a project to modify the severity of an incident.\n\n- CVE-2021-41082: Discourse is a platform for community discussion. In affected versions any private message that includes a group had its title and participating user exposed to users that do not have access to the private messages. However, access control for the private messages was not compromised as users were not able to view the posts in the leaked private message despite seeing it in their inbox. The problematic commit was reverted around 32 minutes after it was made. Users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest commit if they are running Discourse against the `tests-passed` branch.\n\n- CVE-2021-41189: DSpace is an open source turnkey repository application. In version 7.0, any community or collection administrator can escalate their permission up to become system administrator. This vulnerability only exists in 7.0 and does not impact 6.x or below. This issue is patched in version 7.1. As a workaround, users of 7.0 may temporarily disable the ability for community or collection administrators to manage permissions or workflows settings.\n\n- CVE-2021-41230: Pomerium is an open source identity-aware access proxy. In affected versions changes to the OIDC claims of a user after initial login are not reflected in policy evaluation when using `allowed_idp_claims` as part of policy. If using `allowed_idp_claims` and a user's claims are changed, Pomerium can make incorrect authorization decisions. This issue has been resolved in v0.15.6. For users unable to upgrade clear data on `databroker` service by clearing redis or restarting the in-memory databroker to force claims to be updated.\n\n- CVE-2021-42025: A vulnerability has been identified in Mendix Applications using Mendix 8 (All versions < V8.18.13), Mendix Applications using Mendix 9 (All versions < V9.6.2). Applications built with affected versions of Mendix Studio Pro do not properly control write access for certain client actions. This could allow authenticated attackers to manipulate the content of System.FileDocument objects in some cases, regardless whether they have write access to it.\n\n- CVE-2021-42026: A vulnerability has been identified in Mendix Applications using Mendix 8 (All versions < V8.18.13), Mendix Applications using Mendix 9 (All versions < V9.6.2). Applications built with affected versions of Mendix Studio Pro do not properly control read access for certain client actions. This could allow authenticated attackers to retrieve the changedDate attribute of arbitrary objects, even when they don't have read access to them.\n\n- CVE-2021-43553: PI Vision could disclose information to a user with insufficient privileges for an AF attribute that is the child of another attribute and is configured as a Limits property.\n\n- CVE-2021-29959: When a user has already allowed a website to access microphone and camera, disabling camera sharing would not fully prevent the website from re-enabling it without an additional prompt. This was only possible if the website kept recording with the microphone until re-enabling the camera. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 89.\n\n- CVE-2021-32701: ORY Oathkeeper is an Identity & Access Proxy (IAP) and Access Control Decision API that authorizes HTTP requests based on sets of Access Rules. When you make a request to an endpoint that requires the scope `foo` using an access token granted with that `foo` scope, introspection will be valid and that token will be cached. The problem comes when a second requests to an endpoint that requires the scope `bar` is made before the cache has expired. Whether the token is granted or not to the `bar` scope, introspection will be valid. A patch will be released with `v0.38.12-beta.1`. Per default, caching is disabled for the `oauth2_introspection` authenticator. When caching is disabled, this vulnerability does not exist. The cache is checked in [`func (a *AuthenticatorOAuth2Introspection) Authenticate(...)`](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/blob/6a31df1c3779425e05db1c2a381166b087cb29a4/pipeline/authn/authenticator_oauth2_introspection.go#L152). From [`tokenFromCache()`](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/blob/6a31df1c3779425e05db1c2a381166b087cb29a4/pipeline/authn/authenticator_oauth2_introspection.go#L97) it seems that it only validates the token expiration date, but ignores whether the token has or not the proper scopes. The vulnerability was introduced in PR #424. During review, we failed to require appropriate test coverage by the submitter which is the primary reason that the vulnerability passed the review process.\n\n- CVE-2021-20538: IBM Cloud Pak for Security (CP4S) 1.5.0.0 and 1.5.0.1 could allow a user to obtain sensitive information or perform actions they should not have access to due to incorrect authorization mechanisms.

Affected versions of ZStack REST API are vulnerable to post-authentication Remote Code Execution (RCE) via bypass of the Groovy shell sandbox. The REST API exposes the GET zstack/v1/batch-queries?script endpoint which is backed up by the BatchQueryAction class. Messages are represented by the APIBatchQueryMsg, dispatched to the QueryFacadeImpl facade and handled by the BatchQuery class. The HTTP request parameter script is mapped to the APIBatchQueryMsg.script property and evaluated as a Groovy script in BatchQuery.query the evaluation of the user-controlled Groovy script is sandboxed by SandboxTransformer which will apply the restrictions defined in the registered (sandbox.register()) GroovyInterceptor. Even though the sandbox heavily restricts the receiver types to a small set of allowed types, the sandbox is non effective at controlling any code placed in Java annotations and therefore vulnerable to meta-programming escapes. This issue leads to post-authenticated remote code execution. For more details see the referenced GHSL-2021-065. This issue is patched in versions 3.8.21, 3.10.8, and 4.1.0.\n\n- CVE-2020-9381: controllers/admin.js in Total.js CMS 13 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a POST to the /admin/api/widgets/ URI.

However, the HTTP InputSource allows authenticated users to read data from other sources than intended, such as the local file system, with the privileges of the Druid server process. This is not an elevation of privilege when users access Druid directly, since Druid also provides the Local InputSource, which allows the same level of access. But it is problematic when users interact with Druid indirectly through an application that allows users to specify the HTTP InputSource, but not the Local InputSource. In this case, users could bypass the application-level restriction by passing a file URL to the HTTP InputSource.

In versions 1.41.0 and prior, unauthorised users can access the name, avatar, topic and number of members of a room if they know the ID of the room. This vulnerability is limited to homeservers where the vulnerable homeserver is in the room and untrusted users are permitted to create groups (communities). By default, only homeserver administrators can create groups. However, homeserver administrators can already access this information in the database or using the admin API. As a result, only homeservers where the configuration setting `enable_group_creation` has been set to `true` are impacted. Server administrators should upgrade to 1.41.1 or higher to patch the vulnerability. There are two potential workarounds. Server administrators can set `enable_group_creation` to `false` in their homeserver configuration (this is the default value) to prevent creation of groups by non-administrators. Administrators that are using a reverse proxy could, with partial loss of group functionality, block the endpoints `/_matrix/client/r0/groups/{group_id}/rooms` and `/_matrix/client/unstable/groups/{group_id}/rooms`.\n\n- CVE-2021-39164: Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and Voice over IP. In versions 1.41.0 and prior, unauthorised users can access the membership (list of members, with their display names) of a room if they know the ID of the room. The vulnerability is limited to rooms with `shared` history visibility. Furthermore, the unauthorised user must be using an account on a vulnerable homeserver that is in the room. Server administrators should upgrade to 1.41.1 or later in order to receive the patch. One workaround is available. Administrators of servers that use a reverse proxy could, with potentially unacceptable loss of functionality, block the endpoints: `/_matrix/client/r0/rooms/{room_id}/members` with `at` query parameter, and `/_matrix/client/unstable/rooms/{room_id}/members` with `at` query parameter.\n\n- CVE-2021-0472: In shouldLockKeyguard of LockTaskController.java, there is a possible way to exit App Pinning without a PIN due to a permissions bypass.

Starting with OneFuzz 2.12.0 or greater, an incomplete authorization check allows an authenticated user from any Azure Active Directory tenant to make authorized API calls to a vulnerable OneFuzz instance. To be vulnerable, a OneFuzz deployment must be both version 2.12.0 or greater and deployed with the non-default --multi_tenant_domain option. This can result in read/write access to private data such as software vulnerability and crash information, security testing tools and proprietary code and symbols. Via authorized API calls, this also enables tampering with existing data and unauthorized code execution on Azure compute resources. This issue is resolved starting in release 2.31.0, via the addition of application-level check of the bearer token's `issuer` against an administrator-configured allowlist. As a workaround users can restrict access to the tenant of a deployed OneFuzz instance < 2.31.0 by redeploying in the default configuration, which omits the `--multi_tenant_domain` option.\n\n- CVE-2021-39341: The OptinMonster WordPress plugin is vulnerable to sensitive information disclosure and unauthorized setting updates due to insufficient authorization validation via the logged_in_or_has_api_key function in the ~/OMAPI/RestApi.php file that can used to exploit inject malicious web scripts on sites with the plugin installed.

PAM auth fails to reject locked accounts, which allows a previously authorized user whose account is locked still run Salt commands when their account is locked. This affects both local shell accounts with an active session and salt-api users that authenticate via PAM eauth.\n\n- CVE-2022-23822: In this physical attack, an attacker may potentially exploit the Zynq-7000 SoC First Stage Boot Loader (FSBL) by bypassing authentication and loading a malicious image onto the device. This in turn may further allow the attacker to perform additional attacks such as such as using the device as a decryption oracle. An anticipated mitigation via a 2022.1 patch will resolve the issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-24778: The imgcrypt library provides API exensions for containerd to support encrypted container images and implements the ctd-decoder command line tool for use by containerd to decrypt encrypted container images. The imgcrypt function `CheckAuthorization` is supposed to check whether the current used is authorized to access an encrypted image and prevent the user from running an image that another user previously decrypted on the same system. In versions prior to 1.1.4, a failure occurs when an image with a ManifestList is used and the architecture of the local host is not the first one in the ManifestList. Only the first architecture in the list was tested, which may not have its layers available locally since it could not be run on the host architecture. Therefore, the verdict on unavailable layers was that the image could be run anticipating that image run failure would occur later due to the layers not being available. However, this verdict to allow the image to run enabled other architectures in the ManifestList to run an image without providing keys if that image had previously been decrypted. A patch has been applied to imgcrypt 1.1.4. Workarounds may include usage of different namespaces for each remote user.\n\n- CVE-2022-33174: Power Distribution Units running on Powertek firmware (multiple brands) before 3.30.30 allows remote authorization bypass in the web interface. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker must send an HTTP packet to the data retrieval interface (/cgi/get_param.cgi) with the tmpToken cookie set to an empty string followed by a semicolon. This bypasses an active session authorization check. This can be then used to fetch the values of protected sys.passwd and sys.su.name fields that contain the username and password in cleartext.\n\n- CVE-2021-22240: Improper access control in GitLab EE versions 13.11.6, 13.12.6, and 14.0.2 allows users to be created via single sign on despite user cap being enabled\n\n- CVE-2021-35112: A user with user level permission can access graphics protected region due to improper access control in register configuration in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Mobile, Snapdragon Voice & Music, Snapdragon Wearables\n\n- CVE-2021-37409: Improper access control for some Intel(R) PROSet/Wireless WiFi and Killer(TM) WiFi products may allow a privileged user to potentially enable escalation of privilege via local access.\n\n- CVE-2022-0574: Improper Access Control in GitHub repository publify/publify prior to 9.2.8.\n\n- CVE-2022-1944: When the feature is configured, improper authorization in the Interactive Web Terminal in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions from 11.3 prior to 14.9.5, 14.10 prior to 14.10.4, and 15.0 prior to 15.0.1 allows users with the Developer role to open terminals on other Developers' running jobs\n\n- CVE-2022-2095: An improper access control check in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions starting from 13.7 before 15.0.5, all versions starting from 15.1 before 15.1.4, all versions starting from 15.2 before 15.2.1 allows a malicious authenticated user to view a public project's Deploy Key's public fingerprint and name when that key has write permission. Note that GitLab never asks for nor stores the private key.\n\n- CVE-2022-23488: BigBlueButton is an open source web conferencing system. Versions prior to 2.4-rc-6 are vulnerable to Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data. The moderators-only webcams lock setting is not enforced on the backend, which allows an attacker to subscribe to viewers' webcams, even when the lock setting is applied. (The required streamId was being sent to all users even with lock setting applied). This issue is fixed in version 2.4-rc-6. There are no workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-0406: Improper Authorization in GitHub repository janeczku/calibre-web prior to 0.6.16.\n\n- CVE-2022-35921: fof/byobu is a private discussions extension for Flarum forum. Affected versions were found to not respect private discussion disablement by users. Users of Byobu should update the extension to version 1.1.7, where this has been patched. Users of Byobu with Flarum 1.0 or 1.1 should upgrade to Flarum 1.2 or later, or evaluate the impact this issue has on your forum's users and choose to disable the extension if needed. There are no workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-41923: Grails Spring Security Core plugin is vulnerable to privilege escalation. The vulnerability allows an attacker access to one endpoint (i.e. the targeted endpoint) using the authorization requirements of a different endpoint (i.e. the donor endpoint). In some Grails framework applications, access to the targeted endpoint will be granted based on meeting the authorization requirements of the donor endpoint, which can result in a privilege escalation attack. This vulnerability has been patched in grails-spring-security-core versions 3.3.2, 4.0.5 and 5.1.1. Impacted Applications: Grails Spring Security Core plugin versions: 1.x 2.x >=3.0.0 <3.3.2 >=4.0.0 <4.0.5 >=5.0.0 <5.1.1 We strongly suggest that all Grails framework applications using the Grails Spring Security Core plugin be updated to a patched release of the plugin. Workarounds: Users should create a subclass extending one of the following classes from the `grails.plugin.springsecurity.web.access.intercept` package, depending on their security configuration: * `AnnotationFilterInvocationDefinition` * `InterceptUrlMapFilterInvocationDefinition` * `RequestmapFilterInvocationDefinition` In each case, the subclass should override the `calculateUri` method like so: ``` @Override protected String calculateUri(HttpServletRequest request) { UrlPathHelper.defaultInstance.getRequestUri(request) } ``` This should be considered a temporary measure, as the patched versions of grails-spring-security-core deprecates the `calculateUri` method. Once upgraded to a patched version of the plugin, this workaround is no longer needed. The workaround is especially important for version 2.x, as no patch is available version 2.x of the GSSC plugin.\n\n- CVE-2022-0580: Incorrect Authorization in Packagist librenms/librenms prior to 22.2.0. \n\n- CVE-2022-1223: Incorrect Authorization in GitHub repository phpipam/phpipam prior to 1.4.6. \n\n- CVE-2022-0117: Policy bypass in Blink in Google Chrome prior to 97.0.4692.71 allowed a remote attacker to leak cross-origin data via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2022-0334: A flaw was found in Moodle in versions 3.11 to 3.11.4, 3.10 to 3.10.8, 3.9 to 3.9.11 and earlier unsupported versions.

IBM X-Force ID: 231360.\n\n- CVE-2022-2408: The Guest account feature in Mattermost version 6.7.0 and earlier fails to properly restrict the permissions, which allows a guest user to fetch a list of all public channels in the team, in spite of not being part of those channels.\n\n- CVE-2022-0985: Insufficient capability checks could allow users with the moodle/site:uploadusers capability to delete users, without having the necessary moodle/user:delete capability.\n\n- CVE-2022-1460: An issue has been discovered in GitLab affecting all versions starting from 9.2 before 14.8.6, all versions starting from 14.9 before 14.9.4, all versions starting from 14.10 before 14.10.1. GitLab was not performing correct authorizations on scheduled pipelines allowing a malicious user to run a pipeline in the context of another user.\n\n- CVE-2022-24748: Shopware is an open commerce platform based on the Symfony php Framework and the Vue javascript framework. In versions prior to 6.4.8.2 it is possible to modify customers and to create orders without App Permission. This issue is a result of improper api route checking. Users are advised to upgrade to version 6.4.8.2. There are no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-25335: RigoBlock Dragos through 2022-02-17 lacks the onlyOwner modifier for setMultipleAllowances. This enables token manipulation, as exploited in the wild in February 2022. NOTE: although 2022-02-17 is the vendor's vulnerability announcement date, the vulnerability will not be remediated until a major protocol upgrade occurs.\n\n- CVE-2022-36103: Talos Linux is a Linux distribution built for Kubernetes deployments. Talos worker nodes use a join token to get accepted into the Talos cluster. Due to improper validation of the request while signing a worker node CSR (certificate signing request) Talos control plane node might issue Talos API certificate which allows full access to Talos API on a control plane node. Accessing Talos API with full level access on a control plane node might reveal sensitive information which allows full level access to the cluster (Kubernetes and Talos PKI, etc.). Talos API join token is stored in the machine configuration on the worker node. When configured correctly, Kubernetes workloads don't have access to the machine configuration, but due to a misconfiguration workload might access the machine configuration and reveal the join token. This problem has been fixed in Talos 1.2.2. Enabling the Pod Security Standards mitigates the vulnerability by denying hostPath mounts and host networking by default in the baseline policy. Clusters that don't run untrusted workloads are not affected. Clusters with correct Pod Security configurations which don't allow hostPath mounts, and secure access to cloud metadata server (or machine configuration is not supplied via cloud metadata server) are not affected.\n\n- CVE-2022-46792: Hasura GraphQL Engine before 2.15.2 mishandles row-level authorization in the Update Many API for Postgres backends. The fixed versions are 2.10.2, 2.11.3, 2.12.1, 2.13.2, 2.14.1, and 2.15.2. (Versions before 2.10.0 are unaffected.)\n\n- CVE-2022-3048: Inappropriate implementation in Chrome OS lockscreen in Google Chrome on Chrome OS prior to 105.0.5195.52 allowed a local attacker to bypass lockscreen navigation restrictions via physical access to the device.\n\n- CVE-2021-30538: Insufficient policy enforcement in content security policy in Google Chrome prior to 91.0.4472.77 allowed a remote attacker to bypass content security policy via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-30539: Insufficient policy enforcement in content security policy in Google Chrome prior to 91.0.4472.77 allowed a remote attacker to bypass content security policy via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-31876: Bitcoin Core 0.12.0 through 0.21.1 does not properly implement the replacement policy specified in BIP125, which makes it easier for attackers to trigger a loss of funds, or a denial of service attack against downstream projects such as Lightning network nodes. An unconfirmed child transaction with nSequence = 0xff_ff_ff_ff, spending an unconfirmed parent with nSequence <= 0xff_ff_ff_fd, should be replaceable because there is inherited signaling by the child transaction. However, the actual PreChecks implementation does not enforce this. Instead, mempool rejects the replacement attempt of the unconfirmed child transaction.\n\n- CVE-2021-3763: A flaw was found in the Red Hat AMQ Broker management console in version 7.8 where an existing user is able to access some limited information even when the role the user is assigned to should not be allow access to the management console. The main impact is to confidentiality as this flaw means some role bindings are incorrectly checked, some privileged meta information such as queue names and configuration details are disclosed but the impact is limited as not all information is accessible and there is no affect to integrity.\n\n- CVE-2021-39206: Pomerium is an open source identity-aware access proxy. Envoy, which Pomerium is based on, contains two authorization related vulnerabilities CVE-2021-32777 and CVE-2021-32779. This may lead to incorrect routing or authorization policy decisions. With specially crafted requests, incorrect authorization or routing decisions may be made by Pomerium. Pomerium v0.14.8 and v0.15.1 contain an upgraded envoy binary with these vulnerabilities patched. This issue can only be triggered when using path prefix based policy. Removing any such policies should provide mitigation.\n\n- CVE-2022-0333: A flaw was found in Moodle in versions 3.11 to 3.11.4, 3.10 to 3.10.8, 3.9 to 3.9.11 and earlier unsupported versions. The calendar:manageentries capability allowed managers to access or modify any calendar event, but should have been restricted from accessing user level events.\n\n- CVE-2022-0633: The UpdraftPlus WordPress plugin Free before 1.22.3 and Premium before 2.22.3 do not properly validate a user has the required privileges to access a backup's nonce identifier, which may allow any users with an account on the site (such as subscriber) to download the most recent site & database backup.\n\n- CVE-2022-0740: Incorrect authorization in the Asana integration's branch restriction feature in all versions of GitLab CE/EE starting from version 7.8.0 before 14.7.7, all versions starting from 14.8 before 14.8.5, all versions starting from 14.9 before 14.9.2 makes it possible to close Asana tasks from unrestricted branches.\n\n- CVE-2022-0825: The Amelia WordPress plugin before 1.0.49 does not have proper authorisation when managing appointments, allowing any customer to update other's booking status, as well as retrieve sensitive information about the bookings, such as the full name and phone number of the person who booked it.\n\n- CVE-2022-1935: Incorrect authorization in GitLab EE affecting all versions from 12.0 before 14.9.5, all versions starting from 14.10 before 14.10.4, all versions starting from 15.0 before 15.0.1 allowed an attacker already in possession of a valid Project Trigger Token to misuse it from any location even when IP address restrictions were configured\n\n- CVE-2022-1936: Incorrect authorization in GitLab EE affecting all versions from 12.0 before 14.9.5, all versions starting from 14.10 before 14.10.4, all versions starting from 15.0 before 15.0.1 allowed an attacker already in possession of a valid Project Deploy Token to misuse it from any location even when IP address restrictions were configured\n\n- CVE-2022-1981: An issue has been discovered in GitLab EE affecting all versions starting from 12.2 prior to 14.10.5, 15.0 prior to 15.0.4, and 15.1 prior to 15.1.1. In GitLab, if a group enables the setting to restrict access to users belonging to specific domains, that allow-list may be bypassed if a Maintainer uses the 'Invite a group' feature to invite a group that has members that don't comply with domain allow-list.\n\n- CVE-2022-21701: Istio is an open platform to connect, manage, and secure microservices. In versions 1.12.0 and 1.12.1 Istio is vulnerable to a privilege escalation attack. Users who have `CREATE` permission for `gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io` objects can escalate this privilege to create other resources that they may not have access to, such as `Pod`. This vulnerability impacts only an Alpha level feature, the Kubernetes Gateway API. This is not the same as the Istio Gateway type (gateways.networking.istio.io), which is not vulnerable. Users are advised to upgrade to resolve this issue. Users unable to upgrade should implement any of the following which will prevent this vulnerability: Remove the gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io CustomResourceDefinition, set PILOT_ENABLE_GATEWAY_API_DEPLOYMENT_CONTROLLER=true environment variable in Istiod, or remove CREATE permissions for gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io objects from untrusted users.\n\n- CVE-2022-22326: IBM Datapower Gateway 10.0.2.0 through 10.0.4.0, 10.0.1.0 through 10.0.1.5, and 2018.4.1.0 through 2018.4.1.18 could allow unauthorized viewing of logs and files due to insufficient authorization checks. IBM X-Force ID: 218856.\n\n- CVE-2022-23490: BigBlueButton is an open source web conferencing system. Versions prior to 2.4.0 expose sensitive information to Unauthorized Actors. This issue affects meetings with polls, where the attacker is a meeting participant. Subscribing to the current-poll collection does not update the client UI, but does give the attacker access to the contents of the collection, which include the individual poll responses. This issue is patched in version 2.4.0. There are no workarounds. \n\n- CVE-2022-23615: XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. In affected versions any user with SCRIPT right can save a document with the right of the current user which allow accessing API requiring programming right if the current user has programming right. This has been patched in XWiki 13.0. Users are advised to update to resolve this issue. The only known workaround is to limit SCRIPT access.\n\n- CVE-2022-23627: ArchiSteamFarm (ASF) is a C# application with primary purpose of idling Steam cards from multiple accounts simultaneously. Due to a bug in ASF code, introduced in version V5.2.2.2, the program didn't adequately verify effective access of the user sending proxy (i.e. `[Bots]`) commands. In particular, a proxy-like command sent to bot `A` targeting bot `B` has incorrectly verified user's access against bot `A` - instead of bot `B`, to which the command was originally designated. This in result allowed access to resources beyond those configured, being a security threat affecting confidentiality of other bot instances. A successful attack exploiting this bug requires a significant access granted explicitly by original owner of the ASF process prior to that, as attacker has to control at least a single bot in the process to make use of this inadequate access verification loophole. The issue is patched in ASF V5.2.2.5, V5.2.3.2 and future versions. Users are advised to update as soon as possible.\n\n- CVE-2022-23739: An incorrect authorization vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server, allowing for escalation of privileges in GraphQL API requests from GitHub Apps. This vulnerability allowed an app installed on an organization to gain access to and modify most organization-level resources that are not tied to a repository regardless of granted permissions, such as users and organization-wide projects. Resources associated with repositories were not impacted, such as repository file content, repository-specific projects, issues, or pull requests. This vulnerability affected all versions of GitHub Enterprise Server prior to 3.7.1 and was fixed in versions 3.3.16, 3.4.11, 3.5.8, 3.6.4, 3.7.1.

Installations of Icinga 2 with the IDO writer enabled are affected. If you use service custom variables in role restrictions, and you regularly decommission service objects, users with said roles may still have access to a collection of content. Note that this only applies if a role has implicitly permitted access to hosts, due to permitted access to at least one of their services. If access to a host is permitted by other means, no sensible information has been disclosed to unauthorized users. This issue has been resolved in versions 2.8.6, 2.9.6 and 2.10 of Icinga Web 2.\n\n- CVE-2022-24721: CometD is a scalable comet implementation for web messaging. In any version prior to 5.0.11, 6.0.6, and 7.0.6, internal usage of Oort and Seti channels is improperly authorized, so any remote user could subscribe and publish to those channels. By subscribing to those channels, a remote user may be able to watch cluster-internal traffic that contains other users' (possibly sensitive) data. By publishing to those channels, a remote user may be able to create/modify/delete other user's data and modify the cluster structure. A fix is available in versions 5.0.11, 6.0.6, and 7.0.6. As a workaround, install a custom `SecurityPolicy` that forbids subscription and publishing to remote, non-Oort, sessions on Oort and Seti channels.\n\n- CVE-2022-2597: The Visual Portfolio, Photo Gallery & Post Grid WordPress plugin before 2.19.0 does not have proper authorisation checks in some of its REST endpoints, allowing users with a role as low as contributor to call them and inject arbitrary CSS in arbitrary saved layouts\n\n- CVE-2022-26767: The issue was addressed with additional permissions checks.

In versions 5.3 until 9.0.3, 8.5.9, 8.4.10, and 8.3.10, it is possible for a malicious user who has authorization to log into a Grafana instance via a configured OAuth IdP which provides a login name to take over the account of another user in that Grafana instance. This can occur when the malicious user is authorized to log in to Grafana via OAuth, the malicious user's external user id is not already associated with an account in Grafana, the malicious user's email address is not already associated with an account in Grafana, and the malicious user knows the Grafana username of the target user. If these conditions are met, the malicious user can set their username in the OAuth provider to that of the target user, then go through the OAuth flow to log in to Grafana. Due to the way that external and internal user accounts are linked together during login, if the conditions above are all met then the malicious user will be able to log in to the target user's Grafana account. Versions 9.0.3, 8.5.9, 8.4.10, and 8.3.10 contain a patch for this issue. As a workaround, concerned users can disable OAuth login to their Grafana instance, or ensure that all users authorized to log in via OAuth have a corresponding user account in Grafana linked to their email address.\n\n- CVE-2022-31155: Sourcegraph is an opensource code search and navigation engine.

JDPI incorrectly classifies out-of-state asymmetric TCP flows as the dynamic-application INCONCLUSIVE instead of UNKNOWN, which is more permissive, causing the firewall to allow traffic to be forwarded that should have been denied. This issue only occurs when 'set security flow tcp-session no-syn-check' is configured on the device. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series: 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R2-S9, 18.4R3-S9; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R2-S3, 19.1R3-S6; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S7, 19.2R3-S3; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R2-S6, 19.3R3-S2; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R2-S5, 19.4R3-S3; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R2-S2, 20.1R3; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R3-S1; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R3; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R2-S1, 20.4R3; 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R1-S1, 21.1R2.

While JDPI correctly classifies out-of-state asymmetric TCP flows as the dynamic-application UNKNOWN, this classification is not provided to the policy module properly and hence traffic continues to use the pre-id-default-policy, which is more permissive, causing the firewall to allow traffic to be forwarded that should have been denied. This issue only occurs when 'set security flow tcp-session no-syn-check' is configured on the device. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series: 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R2-S10, 18.4R3-S10; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R3-S8; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S8, 19.2R3-S4; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R3-S3; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R3-S5; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R3-S1; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R3-S2; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R3-S1; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R2-S2, 20.4R3; 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R2-S2, 21.1R3; 21.2 versions prior to 21.2R2.

Other users could see information such as command line arguments or environment variable settings. When this data contains sensitive information such as credentials, it might allow other users to launch an attack against the product or related resources.\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2005-1387: password passed on command line\n\n- CVE-2005-2291: password passed on command line\n\n- CVE-2001-1565: username/password on command line allows local users to view via \"ps\" or other process listing programs\n\n- CVE-2004-1948: Username/password on command line allows local users to view via \"ps\" or other process listing programs.\n\n- CVE-1999-1270: PGP passphrase provided as command line argument.\n\n- CVE-2004-1058: Kernel race condition allows reading of environment variables of a process that is still spawning.\n\n- CVE-2021-32638: Code analysis product passes access tokens as a command-line parameter or through an environment variable, making them visible to other processes via the ps command.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-1753: A security flaw was found in Ansible Engine, all Ansible 2.7.x versions prior to 2.7.17, all Ansible 2.8.x versions prior to 2.8.11 and all Ansible 2.9.x versions prior to 2.9.7, when managing kubernetes using the k8s module. Sensitive parameters such as passwords and tokens are passed to kubectl from the command line, not using an environment variable or an input configuration file. This will disclose passwords and tokens from process list and no_log directive from debug module would not have any effect making these secrets being disclosed on stdout and log files.\n\n- CVE-2021-32638: Github's CodeQL action is provided to run CodeQL-based code scanning on non-GitHub CI/CD systems and requires a GitHub access token to connect to a GitHub repository. The runner and its documentation previously suggested passing the GitHub token as a command-line parameter to the process instead of reading it from a file, standard input, or an environment variable. This approach made the token visible to other processes on the same machine, for example in the output of the `ps` command. If the CI system publicly exposes the output of `ps`, for example by logging the output, then the GitHub access token can be exposed beyond the scope intended. Users of the CodeQL runner on 3rd-party systems, who are passing a GitHub token via the `--github-auth` flag, are affected. This applies to both GitHub.com and GitHub Enterprise users. Users of the CodeQL Action on GitHub Actions are not affected. The `--github-auth` flag is now considered insecure and deprecated. The undocumented `--external-repository-token` flag has been removed. To securely provide a GitHub access token to the CodeQL runner, users should **do one of the following instead**: Use the `--github-auth-stdin` flag and pass the token on the command line via standard input OR set the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable to contain the token, then call the command without passing in the token. The old flag remains present for backwards compatibility with existing workflows. If the user tries to specify an access token using the `--github-auth` flag, there is a deprecation warning printed to the terminal that directs the user to one of the above options. All CodeQL runner releases codeql-bundle-20210304 onwards contain the patches. We recommend updating to a recent version of the CodeQL runner, storing a token in your CI system's secret storage mechanism, and passing the token to the CodeQL runner using `--github-auth-stdin` or the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable. If still using the old flag, ensure that process output, such as from `ps`, is not persisted in CI logs.\n\n- CVE-2022-31238: Dell PowerScale OneFS, versions 9.0.0 up to and including 9.1.0.19, 9.2.1.12, 9.3.0.6, and 9.4.0.2, contain a process invoked with sensitive information vulnerability. A CLI user may potentially exploit this vulnerability, leading to information disclosure.\n\n- CVE-2022-30586: Gradle Enterprise through 2022.2.2 has Incorrect Access Control that leads to code execution.\n\n- CVE-2022-0235: node-fetch is vulnerable to Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n\n- CVE-2022-0851: There is a flaw in convert2rhel. When the --activationkey option is used with convert2rhel, the activation key is subsequently passed to subscription-manager via the command line, which could allow unauthorized users locally on the machine to view the activation key via the process command line via e.g. htop or ps. The specific impact varies upon the subscription, but generally this would allow an attacker to register systems purchased by the victim until discovered; a form of fraud. This could occur regardless of how the activation key is supplied to convert2rhel because it involves how convert2rhel provides it to subscription-manager.\n\n- CVE-2022-1662: In convert2rhel, there's an ansible playbook named ansible/run-convert2rhel.yml which passes the Red Hat Subscription Manager user password via the CLI to convert2rhel. This could allow unauthorized local users to view the password via the process list while convert2rhel is running. However, this ansible playbook is only an example in the upstream repository and it is not shipped in officially supported versions of convert2rhel.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-497 (ChildOf)",

A malicious user can modify the contents of a `confirmation_token` input during the two-factor authentication process to reference a cache value not associated with the login attempt. In rare cases this can allow a malicious actor to authenticate as a random user in the Panel. The malicious user must target an account with two-factor authentication enabled, and then must provide a correct two-factor authentication token before being authenticated as that user. Due to a validation flaw in the logic handling user authentication during the two-factor authentication process a malicious user can trick the system into loading credentials for an arbitrary user by modifying the token sent to the server. This authentication flaw is present in the `LoginCheckpointController@__invoke` method which handles two-factor authentication for a user. This controller looks for a request input parameter called `confirmation_token` which is expected to be a 64 character random alpha-numeric string that references a value within the Panel's cache containing a `user_id` value. This value is then used to fetch the user that attempted to login, and lookup their two-factor authentication token. Due to the design of this system, any element in the cache that contains only digits could be referenced by a malicious user, and whatever value is stored at that position would be used as the `user_id`. There are a few different areas of the Panel that store values into the cache that are integers, and a user who determines what those cache keys are could pass one of those keys which would cause this code pathway to reference an arbitrary user. At its heart this is a high-risk login bypass vulnerability. However, there are a few additional conditions that must be met in order for this to be successfully executed, notably: 1.) The account referenced by the malicious cache key must have two-factor authentication enabled. An account without two-factor authentication would cause an exception to be triggered by the authentication logic, thusly exiting this authentication flow. 2.) Even if the malicious user is able to reference a valid cache key that references a valid user account with two-factor authentication, they must provide a valid two-factor authentication token. However, due to the design of this endpoint once a valid user account is found with two-factor authentication enabled there is no rate-limiting present, thusly allowing an attacker to brute force combinations until successful. This leads to a third condition that must be met: 3.) For the duration of this attack sequence the cache key being referenced must continue to exist with a valid `user_id` value. Depending on the specific key being used for this attack, this value may disappear quickly, or be changed by other random user interactions on the Panel, outside the control of the attacker. In order to mitigate this vulnerability the underlying authentication logic was changed to use an encrypted session store that the user is therefore unable to control the value of. This completely removed the use of a user-controlled value being used. In addition, the code was audited to ensure this type of vulnerability is not present elsewhere.\n\n- CVE-2021-42338: 4MOSAn GCB Doctor\u2019s login page has improper validation of Cookie, which allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to bypass authentication by code injection in cookie, and arbitrarily manipulate the system or interrupt services by upload and execution of arbitrary files.\n\n- CVE-2021-1541: Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business 220 Series Smart Switches could allow an attacker to do the following: Hijack a user session Execute arbitrary commands as a root user on the underlying operating system Conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack Conduct an HTML injection attack For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2021-41317: XSS Hunter Express before 2021-09-17 does not properly enforce authentication requirements for paths.\n\n- CVE-2021-29012: DMA Softlab Radius Manager 4.4.0 assigns the same session cookie to every admin session.

This affects users of spnego-http-auth-nginx-module that have enabled basic authentication. This is fixed in version 1.1.1 of spnego-http-auth-nginx-module. As a workaround, one may disable basic authentication.\n\n- CVE-2021-21378: Envoy is a cloud-native high-performance edge/middle/service proxy. In Envoy version 1.17.0 an attacker can bypass authentication by presenting a JWT token with an issuer that is not in the provider list when Envoy's JWT Authentication filter is configured with the `allow_missing` requirement under `requires_any` due to a mistake in implementation. Envoy's JWT Authentication filter can be configured with the `allow_missing` requirement that will be satisfied if JWT is missing (JwtMissed error) and fail if JWT is presented or invalid. Due to a mistake in implementation, a JwtUnknownIssuer error was mistakenly converted to JwtMissed when `requires_any` was configured. So if `allow_missing` was configured under `requires_any`, an attacker can bypass authentication by presenting a JWT token with an issuer that is not in the provider list. Integrity may be impacted depending on configuration if the JWT token is used to protect against writes or modifications. This regression was introduced on 2020/11/12 in PR 13839 which fixed handling `allow_missing` under RequiresAny in a JwtRequirement (see issue 13458). The AnyVerifier aggregates the children verifiers' results into a final status where JwtMissing is the default error. However, a JwtUnknownIssuer was mistakenly treated the same as a JwtMissing error and the resulting final aggregation was the default JwtMissing. As a result, `allow_missing` would allow a JWT token with an unknown issuer status. This is fixed in version 1.17.1 by PR 15194. The fix works by preferring JwtUnknownIssuer over a JwtMissing error, fixing the accidental conversion and bypass with `allow_missing`. A user could detect whether a bypass occurred if they have Envoy logs enabled with debug verbosity. Users can enable component level debug logs for JWT. The JWT filter logs will indicate that there is a request with a JWT token and a failure that the JWT token is missing.\n\n- CVE-2021-21513: Dell EMC OpenManage Server Administrator (OMSA) version 9.5 Microsoft Windows installations with Distributed Web Server (DWS) enabled configuration contains an authentication bypass vulnerability.

A potential attacker might use this ambiguity in usernames to get access to a different account - however, credentials must be known to the adversary. This issue is patched in versions 8.7.49 ELTS, 9.5.38 ELTS, 10.4.33, 11.5.20, 12.1.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-23600: fleet is an open source device management, built on osquery. Versions prior to 4.9.1 expose a limited ability to spoof SAML authentication with missing audience verification. This impacts deployments using SAML SSO in two specific cases: 1. A malicious or compromised Service Provider (SP) could reuse the SAML response to log into Fleet as a user -- only if the user has an account with the same email in Fleet, _and_ the user signs into the malicious SP via SAML SSO from the same Identity Provider (IdP) configured with Fleet. 2. A user with an account in Fleet could reuse a SAML response intended for another SP to log into Fleet. This is only a concern if the user is blocked from Fleet in the IdP, but continues to have an account in Fleet. If the user is blocked from the IdP entirely, this cannot be exploited. Fleet 4.9.1 resolves this issue. Users unable to upgrade should: Reduce the length of sessions on your IdP to reduce the window for malicious re-use, Limit the amount of SAML Service Providers/Applications used by user accounts with access to Fleet, and When removing access to Fleet in the IdP, delete the Fleet user from Fleet as well.\n\n- CVE-2022-24259: An incorrect check in the component cdr.php of Voipmonitor GUI before v24.96 allows unauthenticated attackers to escalate privileges via a crafted request.\n\n- CVE-2022-24883: FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).

In versions prior to 2.4.3, when using Portable Authentication Modules (PAM) for user authentication, if a user presented valid credentials but the account is disabled or otherwise not allowed to access the host (such as an expired password), it would still be accepted for access to Arvados. Other authentication methods (LDAP, OpenID Connect) supported by Arvados are not affected by this flaw. This issue is patched in version 2.4.3. Workaround for this issue is to migrate to a different authentication method supported by Arvados, such as LDAP.\n\n- CVE-2022-39263: `@next-auth/upstash-redis-adapter` is the Upstash Redis adapter for NextAuth.js, which provides authentication for Next.js. Applications that use `next-auth` Email Provider and `@next-auth/upstash-redis-adapter` before v3.0.2 are affected by this vulnerability. The Upstash Redis adapter implementation did not check for both the identifier (email) and the token, but only checking for the identifier when verifying the token in the email callback flow. An attacker who knows about the victim's email could easily sign in as the victim, given the attacker also knows about the verification token's expired duration. The vulnerability is patched in v3.0.2. A workaround is available. Using Advanced Initialization, developers can check the requests and compare the query's token and identifier before proceeding.\n\n- CVE-2022-39355: Discourse Patreon enables syncronization between Discourse Groups and Patreon rewards.

This allows an attacker to use one AK, EK pair from a real TPM to pass EK validation and give the verifier an AK of a software TPM. A successful attack breaks the entire chain of trust because a not validated AK is used by the verifier. This issue is worse if the validation happens first and then the agent gets added to the verifier because the timing is easier and the verifier does not validate the regcount entry being equal to 1,\n\n- CVE-2022-45124: An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the User authentication functionality of WellinTech KingHistorian 35.01.00.05. A specially crafted network packet can lead to a disclosure of sensitive information.

It is distinct from \"AuthN\" (or, sometimes, \"AuthC\") which is an abbreviation of \"authentication.\" The use of \"Auth\" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.\n\nDescription:\n\nThe product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n\nExtended Details:\n\n\n\nAssuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.\n\n\nWhen access control checks are not applied consistently - or not at all - users are able to access data or perform actions that they should not be allowed to perform. This can lead to a wide range of problems, including information exposures, denial of service, and arbitrary code execution.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-24730: Go-based continuous deployment product does not check that a user has certain privileges to update or create an app, allowing adversaries to read sensitive repository information\n\n- CVE-2009-3168: Web application does not restrict access to admin scripts, allowing authenticated users to reset administrative passwords.\n\n- CVE-2009-2960: Web application does not restrict access to admin scripts, allowing authenticated users to modify passwords of other users.\n\n- CVE-2009-3597: Web application stores database file under the web root with insufficient access control (CWE-219), allowing direct request.\n\n- CVE-2009-2282: Terminal server does not check authorization for guest access.\n\n- CVE-2009-3230: Database server does not use appropriate privileges for certain sensitive operations.\n\n- CVE-2009-2213: Gateway uses default \"Allow\" configuration for its authorization settings.\n\n- CVE-2009-0034: Chain: product does not properly interpret a configuration option for a system group, allowing users to gain privileges.\n\n- CVE-2008-6123: Chain: SNMP product does not properly parse a configuration option for which hosts are allowed to connect, allowing unauthorized IP addresses to connect.\n\n- CVE-2008-5027: System monitoring software allows users to bypass authorization by creating custom forms.\n\n- CVE-2008-7109: Chain: reliance on client-side security (CWE-602) allows attackers to bypass authorization using a custom client.\n\n- CVE-2008-3424: Chain: product does not properly handle wildcards in an authorization policy list, allowing unintended access.\n\n- CVE-2009-3781: Content management system does not check access permissions for private files, allowing others to view those files.\n\n- CVE-2008-4577: ACL-based protection mechanism treats negative access rights as if they are positive, allowing bypass of intended restrictions.\n\n- CVE-2008-6548: Product does not check the ACL of a page accessed using an \"include\" directive, allowing attackers to read unauthorized files.\n\n- CVE-2007-2925: Default ACL list for a DNS server does not set certain ACLs, allowing unauthorized DNS queries.\n\n- CVE-2006-6679: Product relies on the X-Forwarded-For HTTP header for authorization, allowing unintended access by spoofing the header.\n\n- CVE-2005-3623: OS kernel does not check for a certain privilege before setting ACLs for files.\n\n- CVE-2005-2801: Chain: file-system code performs an incorrect comparison (CWE-697), preventing default ACLs from being properly applied.\n\n- CVE-2001-1155: Chain: product does not properly check the result of a reverse DNS lookup because of operator precedence (CWE-783), allowing bypass of DNS-based access restrictions.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-24583: The Timetable and Event Schedule WordPress plugin before 2.4.2 does not have proper access control when deleting a timeslot, allowing any user with the edit_posts capability (contributor+) to delete arbitrary timeslot from any events.

Tower runs a memcached, which is accessed via TCP. An attacker can take advantage of writing a playbook polluting this cache, causing a denial of service attack. This attack would not completely stop the service, but in the worst-case scenario, it can reduce the Tower performance, for which memcached is designed. Theoretically, more sophisticated attacks can be performed by manipulating and crafting the cache, as Tower relies on memcached as a place to pull out setting values. Confidential and sensitive data stored in memcached should not be pulled, as this information is encrypted. This flaw affects Ansible Tower versions before 3.6.4, Ansible Tower versions before 3.5.6 and Ansible Tower versions before 3.4.6.\n\n- CVE-2021-1839: The issue was addressed with improved permissions logic.

This is fairly common when using key-based access to resources in a multi-user context.\n\nDescription:\n\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\nExtended Details:\n\n\n\nRetrieval of a user record occurs in the system based on some key value that is under user control. The key would typically identify a user-related record stored in the system and would be used to lookup that record for presentation to the user. It is likely that an attacker would have to be an authenticated user in the system. However, the authorization process would not properly check the data access operation to ensure that the authenticated user performing the operation has sufficient entitlements to perform the requested data access, hence bypassing any other authorization checks present in the system.\n\n\nFor example, attackers can look at places where user specific data is retrieved (e.g. search screens) and determine whether the key for the item being looked up is controllable externally. The key may be a hidden field in the HTML form field, might be passed as a URL parameter or as an unencrypted cookie variable, then in each of these cases it will be possible to tamper with the key value.\n\n\nOne manifestation of this weakness is when a system uses sequential or otherwise easily-guessable session IDs that would allow one user to easily switch to another user's session and read/modify their data.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-36539: An educational application does not appropriately restrict file IDs to a particular user. The attacker can brute-force guess IDs, indicating IDOR.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-26679: vFairs 3.3 is affected by Insecure Permissions.

Several APIs on the web system display, without authorization, sensitive information such as health statements, previous bills in a specific restaurant, alcohol consumption and smoking habits. Each of the described API\u2019s, has in its URL one or more MongoDB ID which is not so simple to enumerate. However, they each receive a \u2018tiny URL\u2019 in Tabit\u2019s domain, in the form of https://tbit.be/{suffix} with suffix being a 5 characters long string containing numbers, lower- and upper-case letters. It is not so simple to enumerate them all, but really easy to find some that work and lead to a personal endpoint. This is both an example of OWASP: API4 - rate limiting and OWASP: API1 - Broken object level authorization. Furthermore, the redirect URL disclosed the MongoDB IDs discussed above, and we could use them to query other endpoints disclosing more personal information. For example: The URL https://tabitisrael.co.il/online-reservations/health-statement?orgId={org_id}&healthStatementId={health_statement_id} is used to invite friends to fill a health statement before attending the restaurant. We can use the health_statement_id to access the https://tgm-api.tabit.cloud/health-statement/{health_statement_id} API which disclose medical information as well as id number.\n\n- CVE-2022-36202: Doctor's Appointment System1.0 is vulnerable to Incorrect Access Control via edoc/patient/settings.php.

A sync token is used in Seafile file syncing protocol to authorize access to library data. To improve performance, the token is cached in memory in seaf-server. Upon receiving a token from sync client or SeaDrive client, the server checks whether the token exist in the cache. However, if the token exists in cache, the server doesn't check whether it's associated with the specific library in the URL. This vulnerability makes it possible to use any valid sync token to access data from any **known** library. Note that the attacker has to first find out the ID of a library which it has no access to. The library ID is a random UUID, which is not possible to be guessed. There are no workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-1949: An access control bypass vulnerability found in 389-ds-base. That mishandling of the filter that would yield incorrect results, but as that has progressed, can be determined that it actually is an access control bypass.

Due to a bug in ASF code `POST /Api/ASF` ASF API endpoint responsible for updating global ASF config incorrectly removed `IPCPassword` from the resulting config when the caller did not specify it explicitly. Due to the above, it was possible for the user to accidentally remove `IPCPassword` security measure from his IPC interface when updating global ASF config, which exists as part of global config update functionality in ASF-ui. Removal of `IPCPassword` possesses a security risk, as unauthorized users may in result access the IPC interface after such modification. The issue is patched in ASF V5.1.2.4 and future versions. We recommend to manually verify that `IPCPassword` is specified after update, and if not, set it accordingly. In default settings, ASF is configured to allow IPC access from `localhost` only and should not affect majority of users.\n\n- CVE-2021-3282: HashiCorp Vault Enterprise 1.6.0 & 1.6.1 allowed the `remove-peer` raft operator command to be executed against DR secondaries without authentication. Fixed in 1.6.2.\n\n- CVE-2021-34675: Basix NEX-Forms through 7.8.7 allows authentication bypass for stored PDF reports.\n\n- CVE-2021-34676: Basix NEX-Forms through 7.8.7 allows authentication bypass for Excel report generation.\n\n- CVE-2021-35941: Western Digital WD My Book Live (2.x and later) and WD My Book Live Duo (all versions) have an administrator API that can perform a system factory restore without authentication, as exploited in the wild in June 2021, a different vulnerability than CVE-2018-18472.\n\n- CVE-2021-37415: Zoho ManageEngine ServiceDesk Plus before 11302 is vulnerable to authentication bypass that allows a few REST-API URLs without authentication.\n\n- CVE-2021-37420: Zoho ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus before 6112 is vulnerable to mail spoofing.\n\n- CVE-2021-37624: FreeSWITCH is a Software Defined Telecom Stack enabling the digital transformation from proprietary telecom switches to a software implementation that runs on any commodity hardware. Prior to version 1.10.7, FreeSWITCH does not authenticate SIP MESSAGE requests, leading to spam and message spoofing. By default, SIP requests of the type MESSAGE (RFC 3428) are not authenticated in the affected versions of FreeSWITCH. MESSAGE requests are relayed to SIP user agents registered with the FreeSWITCH server without requiring any authentication. Although this behaviour can be changed by setting the `auth-messages` parameter to `true`, it is not the default setting. Abuse of this security issue allows attackers to send SIP MESSAGE messages to any SIP user agent that is registered with the server without requiring authentication. Additionally, since no authentication is required, chat messages can be spoofed to appear to come from trusted entities. Therefore, abuse can lead to spam and enable social engineering, phishing and similar attacks. This issue is patched in version 1.10.7. Maintainers recommend that this SIP message type is authenticated by default so that FreeSWITCH administrators do not need to be explicitly set the `auth-messages` parameter. When following such a recommendation, a new parameter can be introduced to explicitly disable authentication.\n\n- CVE-2021-38412: Properly formatted POST requests to multiple resources on the HTTP and HTTPS web servers of the Digi PortServer TS 16 Rack device do not require authentication or authentication tokens. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to enable the SNMP service and manipulate the community strings to achieve further control in.\n\n- CVE-2021-41157: FreeSWITCH is a Software Defined Telecom Stack enabling the digital transformation from proprietary telecom switches to a software implementation that runs on any commodity hardware. By default, SIP requests of the type SUBSCRIBE are not authenticated in the affected versions of FreeSWITCH. Abuse of this security issue allows attackers to subscribe to user agent event notifications without the need to authenticate. This abuse poses privacy concerns and might lead to social engineering or similar attacks. For example, attackers may be able to monitor the status of target SIP extensions. Although this issue was fixed in version v1.10.6, installations upgraded to the fixed version of FreeSWITCH from an older version, may still be vulnerable if the configuration is not updated accordingly. Software upgrades do not update the configuration by default. SIP SUBSCRIBE messages should be authenticated by default so that FreeSWITCH administrators do not need to explicitly set the `auth-subscriptions` parameter. When following such a recommendation, a new parameter can be introduced to explicitly disable authentication.\n\n- CVE-2020-25566: In SapphireIMS 5.0, it is possible to take over an account by sending a request to the Save_Password form as shown in POC. Notice that we do not require a JSESSIONID in this request and can reset any user\u2019s password by changing the username to that user and password to base64(desired password).\n\n- CVE-2021-30167: The manage users profile services of the network camera device allows an authenticated.

Remote attackers can use the vulnerability to view and modify arbitrary content of books without permission.\n\n- CVE-2020-17517: The S3 buckets and keys in a secure Apache Ozone Cluster must be inaccessible to anonymous access by default. The current security vulnerability allows access to keys and buckets through a curl command or an unauthenticated HTTP request. This enables unauthorized access to buckets and keys thereby exposing data to anonymous clients or users. This affected Apache Ozone prior to the 1.1.0 release.\n\n- CVE-2020-4669: IBM Planning Analytics Local 2.0 connects to a MongoDB server. MongoDB, a document-oriented database system, is listening on the remote port, and it is configured to allow connections without password authentication. A remote attacker can gain unauthorized access to the database. IBM X-Force ID: 184600.\n\n- CVE-2021-33924: Confluent Ansible (cp-ansible) version 5.5.0, 5.5.1, 5.5.2 and 6.0.0 is vulnerable to Incorrect Access Control via its auxiliary component that allows remote attackers to access sensitive information.\n\n- CVE-2021-35936: If remote logging is not used, the worker (in the case of CeleryExecutor) or the scheduler (in the case of LocalExecutor) runs a Flask logging server and is listening on a specific port and also binds on 0.0.0.0 by default.

The device sends unnecessary information to the cloud controller server. Although this information is sent encrypted and has low risk in isolation, it decreases the privacy of the end user. The information sent includes the local IP address being used and the SSID of the Wi-Fi network the device is connected to. (Various resources such as wigle.net can be use for mapping of SSIDs to physical locations.)\n\n- CVE-2021-24170: The REST API endpoint get_users in the User Profile Picture WordPress plugin before 2.5.0 returned more information than was required for its functionality to users with the upload_files capability. This included password hashes, hashed user activation keys, usernames, emails, and other less sensitive information.\n\n- CVE-2021-24585: The Timetable and Event Schedule WordPress plugin before 2.4.0 outputs the Hashed Password, Username and Email Address (along other less sensitive data) of the user related to the Even Head of the Timeslot in the response when requesting the event Timeslot data with a user with the edit_posts capability. Combined with the other Unauthorised Event Timeslot Modification issue (https://wpscan.com/reports/submissions/4699/) where an arbitrary user ID can be set, this could allow low privilege users with the edit_posts capability (such as author) to retrieve sensitive User data by iterating over the user_id\n\n- CVE-2021-26566: Insertion of sensitive information into sent data vulnerability in synorelayd in Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM) before 6.2.3-25426-3 allows man-in-the-middle attackers to execute arbitrary commands via inbound QuickConnect traffic.\n\n- CVE-2021-22172: Improper authorization in GitLab 12.8+ allows a guest user in a private project to view tag data that should be inaccessible on the releases page\n\n- CVE-2021-26923: An issue was discovered in Argo CD before 1.8.4.

A compromised pod with sufficient privilege is able to reconfigure the node\u2019s IPv6 interface due to the node accepting route advertisement by default, allowing the attacker to redirect full or partial network traffic from the node to the compromised pod.\n\n- CVE-2020-14371: A credential leak vulnerability was found in Red Hat Satellite. This flaw exposes the compute resources credentials through VMs that are running on these resources in Satellite.\n\n- CVE-2021-20228: A flaw was found in the Ansible Engine 2.9.18, where sensitive info is not masked by default and is not protected by the no_log feature when using the sub-option feature of the basic.py module. This flaw allows an attacker to obtain sensitive information. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality.\n\n- CVE-2021-20331:  Specific versions of the MongoDB C# Driver may erroneously publish events containing authentication-related data to a command listener configured by an application. The published events may contain security-sensitive data when commands such as \"saslStart\", \"saslContinue\", \"isMaster\", \"createUser\", and \"updateUser\" are executed. Without due care, an application may inadvertently expose this authenticated-related information, e.g., by writing it to a log file. This issue only arises if an application enables the command listener feature (this is not enabled by default). This issue affects the MongoDB C# Driver v2.12 versions prior to and including 2.12.1. \n\n- CVE-2021-26593: In Directus 8.x through 8.8.1, an attacker can see all users in the CMS using the API /users/{id}. For each call, they get in response a lot of information about the user (such as email address, first name, and last name) but also the secret for 2FA if one exists. This secret can be regenerated. NOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer\n\n- CVE-2021-28133: Zoom through 5.5.4 sometimes allows attackers to read private information on a participant's screen, even though the participant never attempted to share the private part of their screen. When a user shares a specific application window via the Share Screen functionality, other meeting participants can briefly see contents of other application windows that were explicitly not shared. The contents of these other windows can (for instance) be seen for a short period of time when they overlay the shared window and get into focus. (An attacker can, of course, use a separate screen-recorder application, unsupported by Zoom, to save all such contents for later replays and analysis.) Depending on the unintentionally shared data, this short exposure of screen contents may be a more or less severe security issue.\n\n- CVE-2021-29483: ManageWiki is an extension to the MediaWiki project. The 'wikiconfig' API leaked the value of private configuration variables set through the ManageWiki variable to all users. This has been patched by https://github.com/miraheze/ManageWiki/compare/99f3b2c8af18...befb83c66f5b.patch. If you are unable to patch set `$wgAPIListModules['wikiconfig'] = 'ApiQueryDisabled';` or remove private config as a workaround.\n\n- CVE-2021-31545: An issue was discovered in the AbuseFilter extension for MediaWiki through 1.35.2.

The Special:AbuseFilter/examine form allowed for the disclosure of suppressed MediaWiki usernames to unprivileged users.\n\n- CVE-2021-32747: Icinga Web 2 is an open source monitoring web interface, framework, and command-line interface. A vulnerability in which custom variables are exposed to unauthorized users exists between versions 2.0.0 and 2.8.2. Custom variables are user-defined keys and values on configuration objects in Icinga 2. These are commonly used to reference secrets in other configurations such as check commands to be able to authenticate with a service being checked. Icinga Web 2 displays these custom variables to logged in users with access to said hosts or services. In order to protect the secrets from being visible to anyone, it's possible to setup protection rules and blacklists in a user's role. Protection rules result in `***` being shown instead of the original value, the key will remain. Backlists will hide a custom variable entirely from the user. Besides using the UI, custom variables can also be accessed differently by using an undocumented URL parameter. By adding a parameter to the affected routes, Icinga Web 2 will show these columns additionally in the respective list. This parameter is also respected when exporting to JSON or CSV. Protection rules and blacklists however have no effect in this case. Custom variables are shown as-is in the result. The issue has been fixed in the 2.9.0, 2.8.3, and 2.7.5 releases. As a workaround, one may set up a restriction to hide hosts and services with the custom variable in question.\n\n- CVE-2020-27831: A flaw was found in Red Hat Quay, where it does not properly protect the authorization token when authorizing email addresses for repository email notifications. This flaw allows an attacker to add email addresses they do not own to repository notifications.\n\n- CVE-2021-21396: wire-server is an open-source back end for Wire, a secure collaboration platform. In wire-server from version 2021-02-16 and before version 2021-03-02, the client metadata of all users was exposed in the `GET /users/list-clients` endpoint. The endpoint could be used by any logged in user who could request client details of any other user (no connection required) as far as they can find their User ID. The exposed metadata included id, class, type, location, time, and cookie. A user on a Wire backend could use this endpoint to find registration time and location for each device for a given list of users. As a workaround, remove `/list-clients` from nginx config. This has been fixed in version 2021-03-02.\n\n- CVE-2021-21400: wire-webapp is an open-source front end for Wire, a secure collaboration platform. In wire-webapp before version 2021-03-15-production.0, when being prompted to enter the app-lock passphrase, the typed passphrase will be sent into the most recently used chat when the user does not actively give focus to the input field. Input element focus is enforced programatically in version 2021-03-15-production.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-21621: Jenkins Support Core Plugin 2.72 and earlier provides the serialized user authentication as part of the \"About user (basic authentication details only)\" information, which can include the session ID of the user creating the support bundle in some configurations.\n\n- CVE-2021-21733: The management system of ZXCDN is impacted by the information leak vulnerability. Attackers can make further analysis according to the information returned by the program, and then obtain some sensitive information.

A specially crafted series of network requests can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information.\n\n- CVE-2021-22905: Nextcloud Android App (com.nextcloud.client) before v3.16.0 is vulnerable to information disclosure due to searches for sharees being performed by default on the lookup server instead of only using the local Nextcloud server unless a global search has been explicitly chosen by the user.\n\n- CVE-2021-22912: Nextcloud iOS before 3.4.2 suffers from an information disclosure vulnerability when searches for sharees utilize the lookup server by default instead of only on the local Nextcloud server unless a global search has been explicitly chosen by the user.\n\n- CVE-2021-22913: Nextcloud Deck before 1.2.7, 1.4.1 suffers from an information disclosure vulnerability when searches for sharees utilize the lookup server by default instead of only the local Nextcloud server unless a global search has been explicitly chosen by the user.\n\n- CVE-2021-41109: Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to version 4.10.4, for regular (non-LiveQuery) queries, the session token is removed from the response, but for LiveQuery payloads it is currently not. If a user has a LiveQuery subscription on the `Parse.User` class, all session tokens created during user sign-ups will be broadcast as part of the LiveQuery payload. A patch in version 4.10.4 removes session tokens from the LiveQuery payload. As a workaround, set `user.acl(new Parse.ACL())` in a beforeSave trigger to make the user private already on sign-up.\n\n- CVE-2021-41125: Scrapy is a high-level web crawling and scraping framework for Python. If you use `HttpAuthMiddleware` (i.e. the `http_user` and `http_pass` spider attributes) for HTTP authentication, all requests will expose your credentials to the request target. This includes requests generated by Scrapy components, such as `robots.txt` requests sent by Scrapy when the `ROBOTSTXT_OBEY` setting is set to `True`, or as requests reached through redirects. Upgrade to Scrapy 2.5.1 and use the new `http_auth_domain` spider attribute to control which domains are allowed to receive the configured HTTP authentication credentials. If you are using Scrapy 1.8 or a lower version, and upgrading to Scrapy 2.5.1 is not an option, you may upgrade to Scrapy 1.8.1 instead. If you cannot upgrade, set your HTTP authentication credentials on a per-request basis, using for example the `w3lib.http.basic_auth_header` function to convert your credentials into a value that you can assign to the `Authorization` header of your request, instead of defining your credentials globally using `HttpAuthMiddleware`.\n\n- CVE-2021-42089: An issue was discovered in Zammad before 4.1.1.

When the scs-library-client is used to pull a container image, with authentication, the HTTP Authorization header sent by the client to the library service may be incorrectly leaked to an S3 backing storage provider. This occurs in a specific flow, where the library service redirects the client to a backing S3 storage server, to perform a multi-part concurrent download. Depending on site configuration, the S3 service may be provided by a third party. An attacker with access to the S3 service may be able to extract user credentials, allowing them to impersonate the user. The vulnerable multi-part concurrent download flow, with redirect to S3, is only used when communicating with a Singularity Enterprise 1.x installation, or third party server implementing this flow. Interaction with Singularity Enterprise 2.x, and Singularity Container Services (cloud.sylabs.io), does not trigger the vulnerable flow. We encourage all users to update.

There are currently no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-31069: NestJS Proxy is a NestJS module to decorate and proxy calls. Prior to version 0.7.0, the nestjs-proxy library did not have a way to control when Authorization headers should should be forwarded for specific backend services configured by the application developer. This could have resulted in sensitive information such as OAuth bearer access tokens being inadvertently exposed to such services that should not see them. A new feature has been introduced in the patched version of nestjs-proxy that allows application developers to opt out of forwarding the Authorization headers on a per service basis using the `forwardToken` config setting. Developers are advised to review the README for this library on Github or NPM for further details on how this configuration can be applied. This issue has been fixed in version 0.7.0 of `@finastra/nestjs-proxy`. Users of `@ffdc/nestjs-proxy` are advised that this package has been deprecated and is no longer being maintained or receiving updates. Such users should update their package.json file to use `@finastra/nestjs-proxy` instead.\n\n- CVE-2022-31070: NestJS Proxy is a NestJS module to decorate and proxy calls. Prior to version 0.7.0, the nestjs-proxy library did not have a way to block sensitive cookies (e.g. session cookies) from being forwarded to backend services configured by the application developer. This could have led to sensitive cookies being inadvertently exposed to such services that should not see them. The patched version now blocks cookies from being forwarded by default. However developers can configure an allow-list of cookie names by using the `allowedCookies` config setting. This issue has been fixed in version 0.7.0 of `@finastra/nestjs-proxy`. Users of `@ffdc/nestjs-proxy` are advised that this package has been deprecated and is no longer being maintained or receiving updates. Such users should update their package.json file to use `@finastra/nestjs-proxy` instead.\n\n- CVE-2022-3348: Just like in the previous report, an attacker could steal the account of different users. But in this case, it's a little bit more specific, because it is needed to be an editor in the same app as the victim.\n\n- CVE-2022-38113: This vulnerability discloses build and services versions in the server response header. \n\n- CVE-2022-46150: Discourse is an open-source discussion platform.

This will allow an attacker to send a NEWSCAN request to a listening agent on the network as well as receive the agent's HTTP request verifying its authtoken. In AEAgent.cpp, the agent responding back over HTTP is vulnerable to a Heap Overflow if the POST payload response is too large. The POST payload response is converted to Unicode using vswprintf. This is written to a buffer only 0x2000 bytes big. If POST payload is larger, then heap overflow will occur.\n\n- CVE-2021-20110: Due to Manage Engine Asset Explorer Agent 1.0.34 not validating HTTPS certificates, an attacker on the network can statically configure their IP address to match the Asset Explorer's Server IP address. This will allow an attacker to send a NEWSCAN request to a listening agent on the network as well as receive the agent's HTTP request verifying its authtoken. In httphandler.cpp, the agent reaching out over HTTP is vulnerable to an Integer Overflow, which can be turned into a Heap Overflow allowing for remote code execution as NT AUTHORITY/SYSTEM on the agent machine. The Integer Overflow occurs when receiving POST response from the Manage Engine server, and the agent calling \"HttpQueryInfoW\" in order to get the \"Content-Length\" size from the incoming POST request. This size is taken, but multiplied to a larger amount. If an attacker specifies a Content-Length size of 1073741823 or larger, this integer arithmetic will wrap the value back around to smaller integer, then calls \"calloc\" with this size to allocate memory. The following API \"InternetReadFile\" will copy the POST data into this buffer, which will be too small for the contents, and cause heap overflow.\n\n- CVE-2021-32728: The Nextcloud Desktop Client is a tool to synchronize files from Nextcloud Server with a computer. Clients using the Nextcloud end-to-end encryption feature download the public and private key via an API endpoint. In versions prior to 3.3.0, the Nextcloud Desktop client fails to check if a private key belongs to previously downloaded public certificate. If the Nextcloud instance serves a malicious public key, the data would be encrypted for this key and thus could be accessible to a malicious actor. This issue is fixed in Nextcloud Desktop Client version 3.3.0. There are no known workarounds aside from upgrading.\n\n- CVE-2021-20327: A specific version of the Node.js mongodb-client-encryption module does not perform correct validation of the KMS server\u2019s certificate. This vulnerability in combination with a privileged network position active MITM attack could result in interception of traffic between the Node.js driver and the KMS service rendering client-side field level encryption (CSFLE) ineffective. This issue was discovered during internal testing and affects mongodb-client-encryption module version 1.2.0, which was available from 2021-Jan-29 and deprecated in the NPM Registry on 2021-Feb-04. This vulnerability does not impact driver traffic payloads with CSFLE-supported key services from applications residing inside the AWS, GCP, and Azure nework fabrics due to compensating controls in these environments. This issue does not impact driver workloads that don\u2019t use Field Level Encryption. This issue affect MongoDB Node.js Driver mongodb-client-encryption module version 1.2.0 \n\n- CVE-2021-20732: The ATOM (ATOM - Smart life App for Android versions prior to 1.8.1 and ATOM - Smart life App for iOS versions prior to 1.8.2) does not verify server certificate properly, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to eavesdrop on encrypted communication via a crafted certificate.\n\n- CVE-2021-20833: The SNKRDUNK Market Place App for iOS versions prior to 2.2.0 does not verify server certificate properly, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to eavesdrop on and/or alter encrypted communication via a crafted certificate.\n\n- CVE-2021-21559: Dell EMC NetWorker, versions 18.x, 19.1.x, 19.2.x 19.3.x, 19.4, and 19.4.0.1 contain an Improper Certificate Validation vulnerability in the client (NetWorker Management Console) components which uses SSL encrypted connection in order to communicate with the application server.

Clients using the Nextcloud end-to-end encryption feature download the public and private key via an API endpoint. In versions prior to 3.16.1, the Nextcloud Android client skipped a step that involved the client checking if a private key belonged to a previously downloaded public certificate. If the Nextcloud instance served a malicious public key, the data would be encrypted for this key and thus could be accessible to a malicious actor. The vulnerability is patched in version 3.16.1. As a workaround, do not add additional end-to-end encrypted devices to a user account.\n\n- CVE-2021-3547: OpenVPN 3 Core Library version 3.6 and 3.6.1 allows a man-in-the-middle attacker to bypass the certificate authentication by issuing an unrelated server certificate using the same hostname found in the verify-x509-name option in a client configuration.\n\n- CVE-2021-20989: Fibaro Home Center 2 and Lite devices with firmware version 4.600 and older initiate SSH connections to the Fibaro cloud to provide remote access and remote support capabilities.

NOTE: the vendor does not consider this a vulnerability because the report is only about use of certificates at the application layer (not the transport layer) and \"Certificates are exchanged in a controlled fashion between entities within a trust relationship. This is why self-signed certificates may be used and why validating certificates isn\u2019t as important as doing so for the transport layer certificates.\"\n\n- CVE-2022-29908: The folioupdate service in Fabasoft Cloud Enterprise Client 22.4.0043 allows Local Privilege Escalation.\n\n- CVE-2021-45035: Velneo vClient on its 28.1.3 version, does not correctly check the certificate of authenticity by default. This could allow an attacker that has access to the network to perform a MITM attack in order to obtain the user\u00b4s credentials.\n\n- CVE-2022-25640: In wolfSSL before 5.2.0, a TLS 1.3 server cannot properly enforce a requirement for mutual authentication. A client can simply omit the certificate_verify message from the handshake, and never present a certificate.\n\n- CVE-2022-31083: Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 4.10.11 and 5.2.2, the certificate in the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter not validated. As a result, authentication could potentially be bypassed by making a fake certificate accessible via certain Apple domains and providing the URL to that certificate in an authData object. Versions 4.0.11 and 5.2.2 prevent this by introducing a new `rootCertificateUrl` property to the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter which takes the URL to the root certificate of Apple's Game Center authentication certificate. If no value is set, the `rootCertificateUrl` property defaults to the URL of the current root certificate as of May 27, 2022. Keep in mind that the root certificate can change at any time and that it is the developer's responsibility to keep the root certificate URL up-to-date when using the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter. There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-287 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-287 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-322 (PeerOf)",

For example, a program may intend that private files can only be provided to a specific user. This effectively defines a control sphere that is intended to prevent attackers from accessing these private files. If the file permissions are insecure, then parties other than the user will be able to access those files.\n\n\nA separate control sphere might effectively require that the user can only access the private files, but not any other files on the system. If the program does not ensure that the user is only requesting private files, then the user might be able to access other files on the system.\n\n\nIn either case, the end result is that a resource has been exposed to the wrong party.\n\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-16247: Philips Clinical Collaboration Platform, Versions 12.2.1 and prior. The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n- CVE-2020-15824: In JetBrains Kotlin from 1.4-M1 to 1.4-RC (as Kotlin 1.3.7x is not affected by the issue. Fixed version is 1.4.0) there is a script-cache privilege escalation vulnerability due to kotlin-main-kts cached scripts in the system temp directory, which is shared by all users by default.\n\n- CVE-2021-22118: In Spring Framework, versions 5.2.x prior to 5.2.15 and versions 5.3.x prior to 5.3.7, a WebFlux application is vulnerable to a privilege escalation: by (re)creating the temporary storage directory, a locally authenticated malicious user can read or modify files that have been uploaded to the WebFlux application, or overwrite arbitrary files with multipart request data.\n\n- CVE-2021-21334: In containerd (an industry-standard container runtime) before versions 1.3.10 and 1.4.4, containers launched through containerd's CRI implementation (through Kubernetes, crictl, or any other pod/container client that uses the containerd CRI service) that share the same image may receive incorrect environment variables, including values that are defined for other containers. If the affected containers have different security contexts, this may allow sensitive information to be unintentionally shared. If you are not using containerd's CRI implementation (through one of the mechanisms described above), you are not vulnerable to this issue. If you are not launching multiple containers or Kubernetes pods from the same image which have different environment variables, you are not vulnerable to this issue. If you are not launching multiple containers or Kubernetes pods from the same image in rapid succession, you have reduced likelihood of being vulnerable to this issue This vulnerability has been fixed in containerd 1.3.10 and containerd 1.4.4. Users should update to these versions.\n\n- CVE-2021-22047: In Spring Data REST versions 3.4.0 - 3.4.13, 3.5.0 - 3.5.5, and older unsupported versions, HTTP resources implemented by custom controllers using a configured base API path and a controller type-level request mapping are additionally exposed under URIs that can potentially be exposed for unauthorized access depending on the Spring Security configuration.\n\n- CVE-2021-22550: An attacker can modify the pointers in enclave memory to overwrite arbitrary memory addresses within the secure enclave. It is recommended to update past 0.6.3 or git commit https://github.com/google/asylo/commit/a47ef55db2337d29de19c50cd29b0deb2871d31c\n\n- CVE-2021-38712: OneNav 0.9.12 allows Information Disclosure of the onenav.db3 contents.

This vulnerability is normally exposed over the network and successful exploitation can lead to exposure of data like system details.\n\n- CVE-2021-40497: SAP BusinessObjects Analysis (edition for OLAP) - versions 420, 430, allows an attacker to exploit certain application endpoints to read sensitive data. These endpoints are normally exposed over the network and successful exploitation could lead to exposure of some system specific data like its version.\n\n- CVE-2021-22044: In Spring Cloud OpenFeign 3.0.0 to 3.0.4, 2.2.0.RELEASE to 2.2.9.RELEASE, and older unsupported versions, applications using type-level `@RequestMapping`annotations over Feign client interfaces, can be involuntarily exposing endpoints corresponding to `@RequestMapping`-annotated interface methods.\n\n- CVE-2021-24001: A compromised content process could have performed session history manipulations it should not have been able to due to testing infrastructure that was not restricted to testing-only configurations. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 88.\n\n- CVE-2021-34723: A vulnerability in a specific CLI command that is run on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to overwrite arbitrary files in the configuration database of an affected device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of specific CLI command parameters. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by issuing that command with specific parameters. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite the content of the configuration database and gain root-level access to an affected device.\n\n- CVE-2021-37704: PhpFastCache is a high-performance backend cache system (packagist package phpfastcache/phpfastcache). In versions before 6.1.5, 7.1.2, and 8.0.7 the `phpinfo()` can be exposed if the `/vendor` is not protected from public access. This is a rare situation today since the vendor directory is often located outside the web directory or protected via server rule (.htaccess, etc). Only the v6, v7 and v8 will be patched respectively in 8.0.7, 7.1.2, 6.1.5. Older versions such as v5, v4 are not longer supported and will **NOT** be patched. As a workaround, protect the `/vendor` directory from public access.\n\n- CVE-2020-36319: Insecure configuration of default ObjectMapper in com.vaadin:flow-server versions 3.0.0 through 3.0.5 (Vaadin 15.0.0 through 15.0.4) may expose sensitive data if the application also uses e.g. @RestController\n\n- CVE-2021-28488: Ericsson Network Manager (ENM) before 21.2 has incorrect access-control behavior (that only affects the level of access available to persons who were already granted a highly privileged role).

Affected applications insufficiently limit the access to the internal user authentication service. This could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to trigger several actions on behalf of valid user accounts.\n\n- CVE-2021-4180: An information exposure flaw in openstack-tripleo-heat-templates allows an external user to discover the internal IP or hostname. An attacker could exploit this by checking the www_authenticate_uri parameter (which is visible to all end users) in configuration files. This would give sensitive information which may aid in additional system exploitation. This flaw affects openstack-tripleo-heat-templates versions prior to 11.6.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-0815: Improper access control vulnerability in McAfee WebAdvisor Chrome and Edge browser extensions up to 8.1.0.1895 allows a remote attacker to gain access to McAfee WebAdvisor settings and other details about the user\u2019s system. This could lead to unexpected behaviors including; settings being changed, fingerprinting of the system leading to targeted scams, and not triggering the malicious software if McAfee software is detected.\n\n- CVE-2021-36710: ToaruOS 1.99.2 is affected by incorrect access control via the kernel. Improper MMU management and having a low GDT address allows it to be mapped in userland. A call gate can then be written to escalate to CPL 0.\n\n- CVE-2021-38505: Microsoft introduced a new feature in Windows 10 known as Cloud Clipboard which, if enabled, will record data copied to the clipboard to the cloud, and make it available on other computers in certain scenarios. Applications that wish to prevent copied data from being recorded in Cloud History must use specific clipboard formats; and Firefox before versions 94 and ESR 91.3 did not implement them. This could have caused sensitive data to be recorded to a user's Microsoft account. *This bug only affects Firefox for Windows 10+ with Cloud Clipboard enabled. Other operating systems are unaffected.*. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 94, Thunderbird < 91.3, and Firefox ESR < 91.3.\n\n- CVE-2021-44522: A vulnerability has been identified in SiPass integrated V2.76 (All versions), SiPass integrated V2.80 (All versions), SiPass integrated V2.85 (All versions), Siveillance Identity V1.5 (All versions), Siveillance Identity V1.6 (All versions < V1.6.284.0).

No authentication is performed by the Server itself on `client` tokens. Authentication & authorization is instead delegated to the k8s API server. However, the Workflow Archive does not interact with k8s, and so any token that looks valid will be considered authenticated, even if it is not a k8s token or even if the token has no RBAC for Argo. To handle the lack of pass-through k8s authN/authZ, the Workflow Archive specifically does the equivalent of a `kubectl auth can-i` check for respective methods.

    "enhanced_query": "## Vulnerability Description\nArgo Workflows is an open source container-native workflow engine for orchestrating parallel jobs on Kubernetes. When using `--auth-mode=client`, Archived Workflows can be retrieved with a fake or spoofed token via the GET Workflow endpoint `/api/v1/workflows/{namespace}/{name}` or when using `--auth-mode=sso`, all Archived Workflows can be retrieved with a valid token via the GET Workflow endpoint `/api/v1/workflows/{namespace}/{name}`. No authentication is performed by the Server itself on `client` tokens. Authentication & authorization is instead delegated to the k8s API server. However, the Workflow Archive does not interact with k8s, and so any token that looks valid will be considered authenticated, even if it is not a k8s token or even if the token has no RBAC for Argo. To handle the lack of pass-through k8s authN/authZ, the Workflow Archive specifically does the equivalent of a `kubectl auth can-i` check for respective methods. In 3.5.7 and 3.5.8, the **auth check was accidentally removed** on the GET Workflow endpoints fallback to archived workflows on these lines, allowing archived workflows to be retrieved with a fake token. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.6.2 and 3.5.13.\n\n### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **rootcause:** **auth check was accidentally removed**\n- **impact:** retrieve archived workflows with fake token\n- **product:** Argo Workflows\n- **version:** 3.5.7 and 3.5.8\n- **component:** GET Workflow endpoints\n\n## CVE Reference Links Content Summary\n```\n{\n  \"Root cause of vulnerability\": \"The vulnerability is due to the accidental removal of the authentication check on the GET Workflow endpoint's fallback to archived workflows. This occurred in pull requests #12736 and #13021, specifically when the code was modified to use a sqlite-based memory store for live workflows. The Workflow Archive does not interact with the k8s API server for authentication, and any token that appears valid is considered authenticated, even if it does not have the correct RBAC permissions for Argo.\",\n  \"Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present\": [\n    \"Inadequate authentication and authorization on the GET Workflow endpoint for archived workflows.\",\n    \"The system relies on token validation rather than proper authentication against the k8s API server when accessing archived workflows in `client` mode.\",\n    \"In `sso` mode, all archived workflows are accessible to users with a valid token regardless of prior access rights.\",\n        \"Accidental removal of auth check in the code\"\n\n  ],\n  \"Impact of exploitation\": \"An attacker can retrieve archived workflows using a fake or spoofed token in `client` mode. In `sso` mode, users can access all archived workflows with a valid token, even if they did not have access before archiving. This leads to unauthorized information disclosure of workflow data.\",\n  \"Attack vectors\": \"The vulnerability can be exploited through network access by sending a GET request to the `/api/v1/workflows/{namespace}/{name}` endpoint with an invalid or spoofed authorization token.\",\n  \"Required attacker capabilities/position\": \"The attacker needs network access to the Argo Workflows server. No prior privileges are required. The attacker can exploit this vulnerability from a remote location with knowledge of the API endpoint. In `client` mode the attacker needs to be able to send requests with a fake token. In `sso` mode the attacker needs to have a valid token.\"\n}\n```\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 863 | Incorrect Authorization | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 1.156 |\n| 2 | 214 | Invocation of Process Using Visible Sensitive Information | Base | Allowed | sparse | 1.137 |\n| 3 | 287 | Improper Authentication | Class | Discouraged | sparse | 1.064 |\n| 4 | 1390 | Weak Authentication | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 1.057 |\n| 5 | 285 | Improper Authorization | Class | Discouraged | sparse | 1.045 |\n| 6 | 502 | Deserialization of Untrusted Data | Base | Allowed | dense | 0.386 |\n| 7 | 613 | Insufficient Session Expiration | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.002 |\n| 8 | 639 | Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key | Base | Allowed | sparse | 1.033 |\n| 9 | 306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | Base | Allowed | sparse | 1.029 |\n| 10 | 201 | Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data | Base | Allowed | sparse | 1.022 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nAuthZ: \"AuthZ\" is typically used as an abbreviation of \"authorization\" within the web application security community. It is distinct from \"AuthN\" (or, sometimes, \"AuthC\") which is an abbreviation of \"authentication.\" The use of \"Auth\" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-285\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Terminology]** \n\nAssuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-39155:** Chain: A microservice integration and management platform compares the hostname in the HTTP Host header in a case-sensitive way (CWE-178, CWE-1289), allowing bypass of the authorization policy (CWE-863) using a hostname with mixed case or other variations.\n- **CVE-2019-15900:** Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).\n- **CVE-2009-2213:** Gateway uses default \"Allow\" configuration for its authorization settings.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-214: Invocation of Process Using Visible Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nA process is invoked with sensitive command-line arguments, environment variables, or other elements that can be seen by other processes on the operating system.\n\n### Extended Description\nMany operating systems allow a user to list information about processes that are owned by other users. Other users could see information such as command line arguments or environment variable settings. When this data contains sensitive information such as credentials, it might allow other users to launch an attack against the product or related resources.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-497\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

These draft mappings were performed by members of the \"Mapping CWE to 62443\" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-35248:** Chat application skips validation when Central Authentication Service (CAS) is enabled, effectively removing the second factor from two-factor authentication\n- **CVE-2022-36436:** Python-based authentication proxy does not enforce password authentication during the initial handshake, allowing the client to bypass authentication by specifying a 'None' authentication type.\n- **CVE-2022-30034:** Chain: Web UI for a Python RPC framework does not use regex anchors to validate user login emails (CWE-777), potentially allowing bypass of OAuth (CWE-1390).\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nAttackers may be able to bypass weak authentication faster and/or with less effort than expected.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-287\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-30034:** Chain: Web UI for a Python RPC framework does not use regex anchors to validate user login emails (CWE-777), potentially allowing bypass of OAuth (CWE-1390).\n- **CVE-2022-35248:** Chat application skips validation when Central Authentication Service (CAS) is enabled, effectively removing the second factor from two-factor authentication\n- **CVE-2021-3116:** Chain: Python-based HTTP Proxy server uses the wrong boolean operators (CWE-480) causing an incorrect comparison (CWE-697) that identifies an authN failure if all three conditions are met instead of only one, allowing bypass of the proxy authentication (CWE-1390)\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-285: Improper Authorization\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nAssuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.\n\n\nWhen access control checks are not applied consistently - or not at all - users are able to access data or perform actions that they should not be allowed to perform. This can lead to a wide range of problems, including information exposures, denial of service, and arbitrary code execution.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nAuthZ: \"AuthZ\" is typically used as an abbreviation of \"authorization\" within the web application security community. It is distinct from \"AuthN\" (or, sometimes, \"AuthC\") which is an abbreviation of \"authentication.\" The use of \"Auth\" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-284\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** CWE-285 is high-level and lower-level CWEs can frequently be used instead. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).\n**Comments:** Look at CWE-285's children and consider mapping to CWEs such as CWE-862: Missing Authorization, CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization, CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource, or others.\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n**Suggested Alternatives:**\n- CWE-862: Missing Authorization\n- CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\n- CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-24730:** Go-based continuous deployment product does not check that a user has certain privileges to update or create an app, allowing adversaries to read sensitive repository information\n- **CVE-2009-3168:** Web application does not restrict access to admin scripts, allowing authenticated users to reset administrative passwords.\n- **CVE-2009-2960:** Web application does not restrict access to admin scripts, allowing authenticated users to modify passwords of other users.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently ensuring that the resulting data will be valid.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nMarshaling, Unmarshaling: Marshaling and unmarshaling are effectively synonyms for serialization and deserialization, respectively.\nPickling, Unpickling: In Python, the \"pickle\" functionality is used to perform serialization and deserialization.\nPHP Object Injection: Some PHP application researchers use this term when attacking unsafe use of the unserialize() function; but it is also used for CWE-915.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-913\nChildOf -> CWE-913\nPeerOf -> CWE-915\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** The relationships between CWE-502 and CWE-915 need further exploration. CWE-915 is more narrowly scoped to object modification, and is not necessarily used for deserialization.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2019-12799:** chain: bypass of untrusted deserialization issue (CWE-502) by using an assumed-trusted class (CWE-183)\n- **CVE-2015-8103:** Deserialization issue in commonly-used Java library allows remote execution.\n- **CVE-2015-4852:** Deserialization issue in commonly-used Java library allows remote execution.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nAccording to WASC, \"Insufficient Session Expiration is when a web site permits an attacker to reuse old session credentials or session IDs for authorization.\"\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-672\nChildOf -> CWE-672\nCanPrecede -> CWE-287\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Other]** The lack of proper session expiration may improve the likely success of certain attacks. For example, an attacker may intercept a session ID, possibly via a network sniffer or Cross-site Scripting attack. Although short session expiration times do not help if a stolen token is immediately used, they will protect against ongoing replaying of the session ID. In another scenario, a user might access a web site from a shared computer (such as at a library, Internet cafe, or open work environment). Insufficient Session Expiration could allow an attacker to use the browser's back button to access web pages previously accessed by the victim.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nRetrieval of a user record occurs in the system based on some key value that is under user control. The key would typically identify a user-related record stored in the system and would be used to lookup that record for presentation to the user. It is likely that an attacker would have to be an authenticated user in the system. However, the authorization process would not properly check the data access operation to ensure that the authenticated user performing the operation has sufficient entitlements to perform the requested data access, hence bypassing any other authorization checks present in the system.\n\n\nFor example, attackers can look at places where user specific data is retrieved (e.g. search screens) and determine whether the key for the item being looked up is controllable externally. The key may be a hidden field in the HTML form field, might be passed as a URL parameter or as an unencrypted cookie variable, then in each of these cases it will be possible to tamper with the key value.\n\n\nOne manifestation of this weakness is when a system uses sequential or otherwise easily-guessable session IDs that would allow one user to easily switch to another user's session and read/modify their data.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nInsecure Direct Object Reference / IDOR: The \"Insecure Direct Object Reference\" term, as described in the OWASP Top Ten, is broader than this CWE because it also covers path traversal (CWE-22). Within the context of vulnerability theory, there is a similarity between the OWASP concept and CWE-706: Use of Incorrectly-Resolved Name or Reference.\nBroken Object Level Authorization / BOLA: BOLA is used in the 2019 OWASP API Security Top 10 and is said to be the same as IDOR.\nHorizontal Authorization: \"Horizontal Authorization\" is used to describe situations in which two users have the same privilege level, but must be prevented from accessing each other's resources. This is fairly common when using key-based access to resources in a multi-user context.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-863\nChildOf -> CWE-863\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

An authenticated attacker can impersonate the foreman-proxy if product enable the Puppet Certificate authority (CA) to sign certificate requests that have subject alternative names (SANs). Foreman do not enable SANs by default and `allow-authorization-extensions` is set to `false` unless user change `/etc/puppetlabs/puppetserver/conf.d/ca.conf` configuration explicitly.\n\n- CVE-2021-25410: Improper access control of a component in CallBGProvider prior to SMR JUN-2021 Release 1 allows local attackers to access arbitrary files with an escalated privilege.\n\n- CVE-2021-22176: An issue has been discovered in GitLab affecting all versions starting with 3.0.1. Improper access control allows demoted project members to access details on authored merge requests\n\n- CVE-2021-39904: An Improper Access Control vulnerability in the GraphQL API in all versions of GitLab CE/EE starting from 13.1 before 14.2.6, all versions starting from 14.3 before 14.3.4, and all versions starting from 14.4 before 14.4.1 allows a Merge Request creator to resolve discussions and apply suggestions after a project owner has locked the Merge Request\n\n- CVE-2021-0571: In ActivityTaskManagerService.startActivity() and AppTaskImpl.startActivity() of ActivityTaskManagerService.java and AppTaskImpl.java, there is possible access to restricted activities due to a permissions bypass. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-11Android ID: A-137395936\n\n- CVE-2021-22490: There is a Permission verification vulnerability in Huawei Smartphone.Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may affect the device performance.\n\n- CVE-2021-38137: Corero SecureWatch Managed Services 9.7.2.0020 does not correctly check swa-monitor and cns-monitor user\u2019s privileges, allowing a user to perform actions not belonging to his role.\n\n- CVE-2021-39119: Affected versions of Atlassian Jira Server and Data Center allow users who have watched an issue to continue receiving updates on the issue even after their Jira account is revoked, via a Broken Access Control vulnerability in the issue notification feature. The affected versions are before version 8.19.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-39138: Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Developers can use the REST API to signup users and also allow users to login anonymously. Prior to version 4.5.1, when an anonymous user is first signed up using REST, the server creates session incorrectly. Particularly, the `authProvider` field in `_Session` class under `createdWith` shows the user logged in creating a password. If a developer later depends on the `createdWith` field to provide a different level of access between a password user and anonymous user, the server incorrectly classified the session type as being created with a `password`. The server does not currently use `createdWith` to make decisions about internal functions, so if a developer is not using `createdWith` directly, they are not affected. The vulnerability only affects users who depend on `createdWith` by using it directly. The issue is patched in Parse Server version 4.5.1. As a workaround, do not use the `createdWith` Session field to make decisions if one allows anonymous login.\n\n- CVE-2021-40654: An information disclosure issue exist in D-LINK-DIR-615 B2 2.01mt. An attacker can obtain a user name and password by forging a post request to the / getcfg.php page\n\n- CVE-2021-40655: An informtion disclosure issue exists in D-LINK-DIR-605 B2 Firmware Version : 2.01MT. An attacker can obtain a user name and password by forging a post request to the / getcfg.php page\n\n- CVE-2020-25564: In SapphireIMS 5.0, it is possible to create local administrator on any client with credentials of a non-privileged user by directly accessing RemoteMgmtTaskSave (Automation Tasks) feature.\n\n- CVE-2021-43998: HashiCorp Vault and Vault Enterprise 0.11.0 up to 1.7.5 and 1.8.4 templated ACL policies would always match the first-created entity alias if multiple entity aliases exist for a specified entity and mount combination, potentially resulting in incorrect policy enforcement. Fixed in Vault and Vault Enterprise 1.7.6, 1.8.5, and 1.9.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-24842: The Bulk Datetime Change WordPress plugin before 1.12 does not enforce capability checks which allows users with Contributor roles to 1) list private post titles of other users and 2) change the posted date of other users' posts.\n\n- CVE-2021-31921: Istio before 1.8.6 and 1.9.x before 1.9.5 contains a remotely exploitable vulnerability where an external client can access unexpected services in the cluster, bypassing authorization checks, when a gateway is configured with AUTO_PASSTHROUGH routing configuration.\n\n- CVE-2021-43781: Invenio-Drafts-Resources is a submission/deposit module for Invenio, a software framework for research data management. Invenio-Drafts-Resources prior to versions 0.13.7 and 0.14.6 does not properly check permissions when a record is published. The vulnerability is exploitable in a default installation of InvenioRDM. An authenticated a user is able via REST API calls to publish draft records of other users if they know the record identifier and the draft validates (e.g. all require fields filled out). An attacker is not able to modify the data in the record, and thus e.g. *cannot* change a record from restricted to public. The problem is patched in Invenio-Drafts-Resources v0.13.7 and 0.14.6, which is part of InvenioRDM v6.0.1 and InvenioRDM v7.0 respectively.\n\n- CVE-2020-11628: An issue was discovered in EJBCA before 6.15.2.6 and 7.x before 7.3.1.2. It is intended to support restriction of available remote protocols (CMP, ACME, REST, etc.) through the system configuration. These restrictions can be bypassed by modifying the URI string from a client. (EJBCA's internal access control restrictions are still in place, and each respective protocol must be configured to allow for enrollment.)\n\n- CVE-2020-13263: An authorization issue relating to project maintainer impersonation was identified in GitLab EE 9.5 and later through 13.0.1 that could allow unauthorized users to impersonate as a maintainer to perform limited actions.\n\n- CVE-2020-15126: In parser-server from version 3.5.0 and before 4.3.0, an authenticated user using the viewer GraphQL query can by pass all read security on his User object and can also by pass all objects linked via relation or Pointer on his User object.\n\n- CVE-2020-1725: A flaw was found in keycloak before version 13.0.0. In some scenarios a user still has access to a resource after changing the role mappings in Keycloak and after expiration of the previous access token.\n\n- CVE-2020-1729: A flaw was found in SmallRye's API through version 1.6.1. The API can allow other code running within the application server to potentially obtain the ClassLoader, bypassing any permissions checks that should have been applied. The largest threat from this vulnerability is a threat to data confidentiality. This is fixed in SmallRye 1.6.2\n\n- CVE-2020-25701: If the upload course tool in Moodle was used to delete an enrollment method which did not exist or was not already enabled, the tool would erroneously enable that enrollment method. This could lead to unintended users gaining access to the course. Versions affected: 3.9 to 3.9.2, 3.8 to 3.8.5, 3.7 to 3.7.8, 3.5 to 3.5.14 and earlier unsupported versions. This is fixed in moodle 3.9.3, 3.8.6, 3.7.9, 3.5.15, and 3.10.\n\n- CVE-2020-28397: A vulnerability has been identified in SIMATIC Drive Controller family (All versions < V2.9.2), SIMATIC ET 200SP Open Controller CPU 1515SP PC2 (incl. SIPLUS variants) (All versions < V21.9), SIMATIC S7 PLCSIM Advanced (All versions > V2 < V4), SIMATIC S7-1200 CPU family (incl. SIPLUS variants) (Version V4.4), SIMATIC S7-1500 CPU family (incl. related ET200 CPUs and SIPLUS variants) (All versions > V2.5 < V2.9.2), SIMATIC S7-1500 Software Controller (All versions > V2.5 < V21.9), TIM 1531 IRC (incl. SIPLUS NET variants) (Version V2.1). Due to an incorrect authorization check in the affected component, an attacker could extract information about access protected PLC program variables over port 102/tcp from an affected device when reading multiple attributes at once.\n\n- CVE-2020-28872: An authorization bypass vulnerability in Monitorr v1.7.6m in Monitorr/assets/config/_installation/_register.php allows an unauthorized person to create valid credentials.\n\n- CVE-2020-29605: An issue was discovered in MantisBT before 2.24.4. Due to insufficient access-level checks, any logged-in user allowed to perform Group Actions can get access to the Summary fields of private Issues via bug_arr[]= in a crafted bug_actiongroup_page.php URL. (The target Issues can have Private view status, or belong to a private Project.)\n\n- CVE-2021-1144: A vulnerability in Cisco Connected Mobile Experiences (CMX) could allow a remote, authenticated attacker without administrative privileges to alter the password of any user on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of authorization checks for changing a password. An authenticated attacker without administrative privileges could exploit this vulnerability by sending a modified HTTP request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to alter the passwords of any user on the system, including an administrative user, and then impersonate that user.\n\n- CVE-2021-1539: Multiple vulnerabilities in the authorization process of Cisco ASR 5000 Series Software (StarOS) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to bypass authorization and execute a subset of CLI commands on an affected device. For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2021-1540: Multiple vulnerabilities in the authorization process of Cisco ASR 5000 Series Software (StarOS) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to bypass authorization and execute a subset of CLI commands on an affected device. For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2021-20179: A flaw was found in pki-core. An attacker who has successfully compromised a key could use this flaw to renew the corresponding certificate over and over again, as long as it is not explicitly revoked. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity.\n\n- CVE-2021-20188: A flaw was found in podman before 1.7.0. File permissions for non-root users running in a privileged container are not correctly checked. This flaw can be abused by a low-privileged user inside the container to access any other file in the container, even if owned by the root user inside the container. It does not allow to directly escape the container, though being a privileged container means that a lot of security features are disabled when running the container. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.\n\n- CVE-2021-20229: A flaw was found in PostgreSQL in versions before 13.2. This flaw allows a user with SELECT privilege on one column to craft a special query that returns all columns of the table. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality.\n\n- CVE-2021-20282: When creating a user account, it was possible to verify the account without having access to the verification email link/secret in moodle before 3.10.2, 3.9.5, 3.8.8, 3.5.17.\n\n- CVE-2021-21182: Insufficient policy enforcement in navigations in Google Chrome prior to 89.0.4389.72 allowed a remote attacker who had compromised the renderer process to bypass navigation restrictions via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-21228: Insufficient policy enforcement in extensions in Google Chrome prior to 90.0.4430.93 allowed an attacker who convinced a user to install a malicious extension to bypass navigation restrictions via a crafted Chrome Extension.\n\n- CVE-2021-21318: Opencast is a free, open-source platform to support the management of educational audio and video content. In Opencast before version 9.2 there is a vulnerability in which publishing an episode with strict access rules will overwrite the currently set series access. This allows for an easy denial of access for all users without superuser privileges, effectively hiding the series. Access to series and series metadata on the search service (shown in media module and player) depends on the events published which are part of the series. Publishing an event will automatically publish a series and update access to it. Removing an event or republishing the event should do the same. Affected versions of Opencast may not update the series access or remove a published series if an event is being removed. On removal of an episode, this may lead to an access control list for series metadata with broader access rules than the merged access rules of all remaining events, or the series metadata still being available although all episodes of that series have been removed. This problem is fixed in Opencast 9.2.\n\n- CVE-2021-21367: Switchboard Bluetooth Plug for elementary OS from version 2.3.0 and before version version 2.3.5 has an incorrect authorization vulnerability. When the Bluetooth plug is running (in discoverable mode), Bluetooth service requests and pairing requests are automatically accepted, allowing physically proximate attackers to pair with a device running an affected version of switchboard-plug-bluetooth without the active consent of the user. By default, elementary OS doesn't expose any services via Bluetooth that allow information to be extracted by paired Bluetooth devices. However, if such services (i.e. contact list sharing software) have been installed, it's possible that attackers have been able to extract data from such services without authorization. If no such services have been installed, attackers are only able to pair with a device running an affected version without authorization and then play audio out of the device or possibly present a HID device (keyboard, mouse, etc...) to control the device. As such, users should check the list of trusted/paired devices and remove any that are not 100% confirmed to be genuine. This is fixed in version 2.3.5. To reduce the likelihood of this vulnerability on an unpatched version, only open the Bluetooth plug for short intervals when absolutely necessary and preferably not in crowded public areas. To mitigate the risk entirely with unpatched versions, do not open the Bluetooth plug within switchboard at all, and use a different method for pairing devices if necessary (e.g. `bluetoothctl` CLI).\n\n- CVE-2021-21389: BuddyPress is an open source WordPress plugin to build a community site. In releases of BuddyPress from 5.0.0 before 7.2.1 it's possible for a non-privileged, regular user to obtain administrator rights by exploiting an issue in the REST API members endpoint. The vulnerability has been fixed in BuddyPress 7.2.1. Existing installations of the plugin should be updated to this version to mitigate the issue.\n\n- CVE-2021-21411: OAuth2-Proxy is an open source reverse proxy that provides authentication with Google, Github or other providers. The `--gitlab-group` flag for group-based authorization in the GitLab provider stopped working in the v7.0.0 release. Regardless of the flag settings, authorization wasn't restricted. Additionally, any authenticated users had whichever groups were set in `--gitlab-group` added to the new `X-Forwarded-Groups` header to the upstream application. While adding GitLab project based authorization support in #630, a bug was introduced where the user session's groups field was populated with the `--gitlab-group` config entries instead of pulling the individual user's group membership from the GitLab Userinfo endpoint. When the session groups where compared against the allowed groups for authorization, they matched improperly (since both lists were populated with the same data) so authorization was allowed. This impacts GitLab Provider users who relies on group membership for authorization restrictions. Any authenticated users in your GitLab environment can access your applications regardless of `--gitlab-group` membership restrictions. This is patched in v7.1.0. There is no workaround for the Group membership bug. But `--gitlab-project` can be set to use Project membership as the authorization checks instead of groups; it is not broken.\n\n- CVE-2021-21609: Jenkins 2.274 and earlier, LTS 2.263.1 and earlier does not correctly match requested URLs to the list of always accessible paths, allowing attackers without Overall/Read permission to access some URLs as if they did have Overall/Read permission.\n\n- CVE-2021-21643: Jenkins Config File Provider Plugin 3.7.0 and earlier does not correctly perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints, allowing attackers with global Job/Configure permission to enumerate system-scoped credentials IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins.\n\n- CVE-2021-21670: Jenkins 2.299 and earlier, LTS 2.289.1 and earlier allows users to cancel queue items and abort builds of jobs for which they have Item/Cancel permission even when they do not have Item/Read permission.\n\n- CVE-2021-21692: FilePath#renameTo and FilePath#moveAllChildrenTo in Jenkins 2.318 and earlier, LTS 2.303.2 and earlier only check 'read' agent-to-controller access permission on the source path, instead of 'delete'.\n\n- CVE-2021-22251: Improper validation of invited users' email address in GitLab EE affecting all versions since 12.2 allowed projects to add members with email address domain that should be blocked by group settings\n\n- CVE-2021-22389: There is a Permission Control Vulnerability in Huawei Smartphone.Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may cause certain codes to be executed.\n\n- CVE-2021-24244: An AJAX action registered by the WPBakery Page Builder (Visual Composer) Clipboard WordPress plugin before 4.5.8 did not have capability checks, allowing low privilege users, such as subscribers, to update the license options (key, email).\n\n- CVE-2021-24278: In the Redirection for Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin before 2.3.4, unauthenticated users can use the wpcf7r_get_nonce AJAX action to retrieve a valid nonce for any WordPress action/function.\n\n- CVE-2021-24279: In the Redirection for Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin before 2.3.4, low level users, such as subscribers, could use the import_from_debug AJAX action to install any plugin from the WordPress repository.\n\n- CVE-2021-24281: In the Redirection for Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin before 2.3.4, any authenticated user, such as a subscriber, could use the delete_action_post AJAX action to delete any post on a target site.\n\n- CVE-2021-24282: In the Redirection for Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin before 2.3.4, any authenticated user, such as a subscriber, could use the various AJAX actions in the plugin to do a variety of things. For example, an attacker could use wpcf7r_reset_settings to reset the plugin\u2019s settings, wpcf7r_add_action to add actions to a form, and more.\n\n- CVE-2021-24379: The Comments Like Dislike WordPress plugin before 1.1.4 allows users to like/dislike posted comments, however does not prevent them from replaying the AJAX request to add a like. This allows any user (even unauthenticated) to add unlimited like/dislike to any comment. The plugin appears to have some Restriction modes, such as Cookie Restriction, IP Restrictions, Logged In User Restriction, however, they do not prevent such attack as they only check client side\n\n- CVE-2021-24652: The PostX \u2013 Gutenberg Blocks for Post Grid WordPress plugin before 2.4.10 performs incorrect checks before allowing any logged in user to perform some ajax based requests, allowing any user to modify, delete or add ultp_options values.\n\n- CVE-2021-24717: The AutomatorWP WordPress plugin before 1.7.6 does not perform capability checks which allows users with Subscriber roles to enumerate automations, disclose title of private posts or user emails, call functions, or perform privilege escalation via Ajax actions.\n\n- CVE-2021-24742: The Logo Slider and Showcase WordPress plugin before 1.3.37 allows Editor users to update the plugin's settings via the rtWLSSettings AJAX action because it uses a nonce for authorisation instead of a capability check.\n\n- CVE-2021-24757: The Stylish Price List WordPress plugin before 6.9.0 does not perform capability checks in its spl_upload_ser_img AJAX action (available to both unauthenticated and authenticated users), which could allow unauthenticated users to upload images.\n\n- CVE-2021-24770: The Stylish Price List WordPress plugin before 6.9.1 does not perform capability checks in its spl_upload_ser_img AJAX action (available to authenticated users), which could allow any authenticated users, such as subscriber, to upload arbitrary images.\n\n- CVE-2021-25777: In JetBrains TeamCity before 2020.2.1, permissions during token removal were checked improperly.\n\n- CVE-2021-25954: In \u201cDolibarr\u201d application, 2.8.1 to 13.0.4 don\u2019t restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor. A low privileged attacker can modify the Private Note which only an administrator has rights to do, the affected field is at \u201c/adherents/note.php?id=1\u201d endpoint.\n\n- CVE-2021-26040: An issue was discovered in Joomla! 4.0.0. The media manager does not correctly check the user's permissions before executing a file deletion command.\n\n- CVE-2021-26563: Incorrect authorization vulnerability in synoagentregisterd in Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM) before 6.2.4-25553 allows local users to execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors.\n\n- CVE-2021-28661: Default SilverStripe GraphQL Server (aka silverstripe/graphql) 3.x through 3.4.1 permission checker not inherited by query subclass.\n\n- CVE-2021-28696: IOMMU page mapping issues on x86 T[his CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Both AMD and Intel allow ACPI tables to specify regions of memory which should be left untranslated, which typically means these addresses should pass the translation phase unaltered. While these are typically device specific ACPI properties, they can also be specified to apply to a range of devices, or even all devices. On all systems with such regions Xen failed to prevent guests from undoing/replacing such mappings (CVE-2021-28694). On AMD systems, where a discontinuous range is specified by firmware, the supposedly-excluded middle range will also be identity-mapped (CVE-2021-28695). Further, on AMD systems, upon de-assigment of a physical device from a guest, the identity mappings would be left in place, allowing a guest continued access to ranges of memory which it shouldn't have access to anymore (CVE-2021-28696).\n\n- CVE-2021-29439: The Grav admin plugin prior to version 1.10.11 does not correctly verify caller's privileges. As a consequence, users with the permission `admin.login` can install third-party plugins and their dependencies. By installing the right plugin, an attacker can obtain an arbitrary code execution primitive and elevate their privileges on the instance. The vulnerability has been addressed in version 1.10.11. As a mitigation blocking access to the `/admin` path from untrusted sources will reduce the probability of exploitation. \n\n- CVE-2021-29943: When using ConfigurableInternodeAuthHadoopPlugin for authentication, Apache Solr versions prior to 8.8.2 would forward/proxy distributed requests using server credentials instead of original client credentials. This would result in incorrect authorization resolution on the receiving hosts.\n\n- CVE-2021-30533: Insufficient policy enforcement in PopupBlocker in Google Chrome prior to 91.0.4472.77 allowed a remote attacker to bypass navigation restrictions via a crafted iframe.\n\n- CVE-2021-30534: Insufficient policy enforcement in iFrameSandbox in Google Chrome prior to 91.0.4472.77 allowed a remote attacker to bypass navigation restrictions via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-31158: In the Query Engine in Couchbase Server 6.5.x and 6.6.x through 6.6.1, Common Table Expression queries were not correctly checking the user's permissions, allowing read-access to resources beyond what those users were explicitly allowed to access.\n\n- CVE-2021-31926: AMP Application Deployment Service in CubeCoders AMP 2.1.x before 2.1.1.2 allows a remote, authenticated user to open ports in the local system firewall by crafting an HTTP(S) request directly to the applicable API endpoint (despite not having permission to make changes to the system's network configuration).\n\n- CVE-2021-33718: A vulnerability has been identified in Mendix Applications using Mendix 7 (All versions < V7.23.22), Mendix Applications using Mendix 8 (All versions < V8.18.7), Mendix Applications using Mendix 9 (All versions < V9.3.0). Write access checks of attributes of an object could be bypassed, if user has a write permissions to the first attribute of this object.\n\n- CVE-2021-34434: In Eclipse Mosquitto versions 2.0 to 2.0.11, when using the dynamic security plugin, if the ability for a client to make subscriptions on a topic is revoked when a durable client is offline, then existing subscriptions for that client are not revoked.\n\n- CVE-2021-35949: The shareinfo controller in the ownCloud Server before 10.8.0 allows an attacker to bypass the permission checks for upload only shares and list metadata about the share.\n\n- CVE-2021-36132: An issue was discovered in the FileImporter extension in MediaWiki through 1.36. For certain relaxed configurations of the $wgFileImporterRequiredRight variable, it might not validate all appropriate user rights, thus allowing a user with insufficient rights to perform operations (specifically file uploads) that they should not be allowed to perform.\n\n- CVE-2021-36230: HashiCorp Terraform Enterprise releases up to v202106-1 did not properly perform authorization checks on a subset of API requests executed using the run token, allowing privilege escalation to organization owner. Fixed in v202107-1.\n\n- CVE-2021-38312: The Gutenberg Template Library & Redux Framework plugin <= 4.2.11 for WordPress used an incorrect authorization check in the REST API endpoints registered under the \u201credux/v1/templates/\u201d REST Route in \u201credux-templates/classes/class-api.php\u201d. The `permissions_callback` used in this file only checked for the `edit_posts` capability which is granted to lower-privileged users such as contributors, allowing such users to install arbitrary plugins from the WordPress repository and edit arbitrary posts.\n\n- CVE-2021-38345: The Brizy Page Builder plugin <= 2.3.11 for WordPress used an incorrect authorization check that allowed any logged-in user accessing any endpoint in the wp-admin directory to modify the content of any existing post or page created with the Brizy editor. An identical issue was found by another researcher in Brizy <= 1.0.125 and fixed in version 1.0.126, but the vulnerability was reintroduced in version 1.0.127.\n\n- CVE-2021-39321: Version 3.3.23 of the Sassy Social Share WordPress plugin is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection via the wp_ajax_heateor_sss_import_config AJAX action due to deserialization of unvalidated user supplied inputs via the import_config function found in the ~/admin/class-sassy-social-share-admin.php file. This can be exploited by underprivileged authenticated users due to a missing capability check on the import_config function.\n\n- CVE-2021-39902: Incorrect Authorization in GitLab CE/EE 13.4 or above allows a user with guest membership in a project to modify the severity of an incident.\n\n- CVE-2021-41082: Discourse is a platform for community discussion. In affected versions any private message that includes a group had its title and participating user exposed to users that do not have access to the private messages. However, access control for the private messages was not compromised as users were not able to view the posts in the leaked private message despite seeing it in their inbox. The problematic commit was reverted around 32 minutes after it was made. Users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest commit if they are running Discourse against the `tests-passed` branch.\n\n- CVE-2021-41189: DSpace is an open source turnkey repository application. In version 7.0, any community or collection administrator can escalate their permission up to become system administrator. This vulnerability only exists in 7.0 and does not impact 6.x or below. This issue is patched in version 7.1. As a workaround, users of 7.0 may temporarily disable the ability for community or collection administrators to manage permissions or workflows settings.\n\n- CVE-2021-41230: Pomerium is an open source identity-aware access proxy. In affected versions changes to the OIDC claims of a user after initial login are not reflected in policy evaluation when using `allowed_idp_claims` as part of policy. If using `allowed_idp_claims` and a user's claims are changed, Pomerium can make incorrect authorization decisions. This issue has been resolved in v0.15.6. For users unable to upgrade clear data on `databroker` service by clearing redis or restarting the in-memory databroker to force claims to be updated.\n\n- CVE-2021-42025: A vulnerability has been identified in Mendix Applications using Mendix 8 (All versions < V8.18.13), Mendix Applications using Mendix 9 (All versions < V9.6.2). Applications built with affected versions of Mendix Studio Pro do not properly control write access for certain client actions. This could allow authenticated attackers to manipulate the content of System.FileDocument objects in some cases, regardless whether they have write access to it.\n\n- CVE-2021-42026: A vulnerability has been identified in Mendix Applications using Mendix 8 (All versions < V8.18.13), Mendix Applications using Mendix 9 (All versions < V9.6.2). Applications built with affected versions of Mendix Studio Pro do not properly control read access for certain client actions. This could allow authenticated attackers to retrieve the changedDate attribute of arbitrary objects, even when they don't have read access to them.\n\n- CVE-2021-43553: PI Vision could disclose information to a user with insufficient privileges for an AF attribute that is the child of another attribute and is configured as a Limits property.\n\n- CVE-2021-29959: When a user has already allowed a website to access microphone and camera, disabling camera sharing would not fully prevent the website from re-enabling it without an additional prompt. This was only possible if the website kept recording with the microphone until re-enabling the camera. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 89.\n\n- CVE-2021-32701: ORY Oathkeeper is an Identity & Access Proxy (IAP) and Access Control Decision API that authorizes HTTP requests based on sets of Access Rules. When you make a request to an endpoint that requires the scope `foo` using an access token granted with that `foo` scope, introspection will be valid and that token will be cached. The problem comes when a second requests to an endpoint that requires the scope `bar` is made before the cache has expired. Whether the token is granted or not to the `bar` scope, introspection will be valid. A patch will be released with `v0.38.12-beta.1`. Per default, caching is disabled for the `oauth2_introspection` authenticator. When caching is disabled, this vulnerability does not exist. The cache is checked in [`func (a *AuthenticatorOAuth2Introspection) Authenticate(...)`](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/blob/6a31df1c3779425e05db1c2a381166b087cb29a4/pipeline/authn/authenticator_oauth2_introspection.go#L152). From [`tokenFromCache()`](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/blob/6a31df1c3779425e05db1c2a381166b087cb29a4/pipeline/authn/authenticator_oauth2_introspection.go#L97) it seems that it only validates the token expiration date, but ignores whether the token has or not the proper scopes. The vulnerability was introduced in PR #424. During review, we failed to require appropriate test coverage by the submitter which is the primary reason that the vulnerability passed the review process.\n\n- CVE-2021-20538: IBM Cloud Pak for Security (CP4S) 1.5.0.0 and 1.5.0.1 could allow a user to obtain sensitive information or perform actions they should not have access to due to incorrect authorization mechanisms.

Affected versions of ZStack REST API are vulnerable to post-authentication Remote Code Execution (RCE) via bypass of the Groovy shell sandbox. The REST API exposes the GET zstack/v1/batch-queries?script endpoint which is backed up by the BatchQueryAction class. Messages are represented by the APIBatchQueryMsg, dispatched to the QueryFacadeImpl facade and handled by the BatchQuery class. The HTTP request parameter script is mapped to the APIBatchQueryMsg.script property and evaluated as a Groovy script in BatchQuery.query the evaluation of the user-controlled Groovy script is sandboxed by SandboxTransformer which will apply the restrictions defined in the registered (sandbox.register()) GroovyInterceptor. Even though the sandbox heavily restricts the receiver types to a small set of allowed types, the sandbox is non effective at controlling any code placed in Java annotations and therefore vulnerable to meta-programming escapes. This issue leads to post-authenticated remote code execution. For more details see the referenced GHSL-2021-065. This issue is patched in versions 3.8.21, 3.10.8, and 4.1.0.\n\n- CVE-2020-9381: controllers/admin.js in Total.js CMS 13 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a POST to the /admin/api/widgets/ URI.

However, the HTTP InputSource allows authenticated users to read data from other sources than intended, such as the local file system, with the privileges of the Druid server process. This is not an elevation of privilege when users access Druid directly, since Druid also provides the Local InputSource, which allows the same level of access. But it is problematic when users interact with Druid indirectly through an application that allows users to specify the HTTP InputSource, but not the Local InputSource. In this case, users could bypass the application-level restriction by passing a file URL to the HTTP InputSource.

In versions 1.41.0 and prior, unauthorised users can access the name, avatar, topic and number of members of a room if they know the ID of the room. This vulnerability is limited to homeservers where the vulnerable homeserver is in the room and untrusted users are permitted to create groups (communities). By default, only homeserver administrators can create groups. However, homeserver administrators can already access this information in the database or using the admin API. As a result, only homeservers where the configuration setting `enable_group_creation` has been set to `true` are impacted. Server administrators should upgrade to 1.41.1 or higher to patch the vulnerability. There are two potential workarounds. Server administrators can set `enable_group_creation` to `false` in their homeserver configuration (this is the default value) to prevent creation of groups by non-administrators. Administrators that are using a reverse proxy could, with partial loss of group functionality, block the endpoints `/_matrix/client/r0/groups/{group_id}/rooms` and `/_matrix/client/unstable/groups/{group_id}/rooms`.\n\n- CVE-2021-39164: Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and Voice over IP. In versions 1.41.0 and prior, unauthorised users can access the membership (list of members, with their display names) of a room if they know the ID of the room. The vulnerability is limited to rooms with `shared` history visibility. Furthermore, the unauthorised user must be using an account on a vulnerable homeserver that is in the room. Server administrators should upgrade to 1.41.1 or later in order to receive the patch. One workaround is available. Administrators of servers that use a reverse proxy could, with potentially unacceptable loss of functionality, block the endpoints: `/_matrix/client/r0/rooms/{room_id}/members` with `at` query parameter, and `/_matrix/client/unstable/rooms/{room_id}/members` with `at` query parameter.\n\n- CVE-2021-0472: In shouldLockKeyguard of LockTaskController.java, there is a possible way to exit App Pinning without a PIN due to a permissions bypass.

Starting with OneFuzz 2.12.0 or greater, an incomplete authorization check allows an authenticated user from any Azure Active Directory tenant to make authorized API calls to a vulnerable OneFuzz instance. To be vulnerable, a OneFuzz deployment must be both version 2.12.0 or greater and deployed with the non-default --multi_tenant_domain option. This can result in read/write access to private data such as software vulnerability and crash information, security testing tools and proprietary code and symbols. Via authorized API calls, this also enables tampering with existing data and unauthorized code execution on Azure compute resources. This issue is resolved starting in release 2.31.0, via the addition of application-level check of the bearer token's `issuer` against an administrator-configured allowlist. As a workaround users can restrict access to the tenant of a deployed OneFuzz instance < 2.31.0 by redeploying in the default configuration, which omits the `--multi_tenant_domain` option.\n\n- CVE-2021-39341: The OptinMonster WordPress plugin is vulnerable to sensitive information disclosure and unauthorized setting updates due to insufficient authorization validation via the logged_in_or_has_api_key function in the ~/OMAPI/RestApi.php file that can used to exploit inject malicious web scripts on sites with the plugin installed.

PAM auth fails to reject locked accounts, which allows a previously authorized user whose account is locked still run Salt commands when their account is locked. This affects both local shell accounts with an active session and salt-api users that authenticate via PAM eauth.\n\n- CVE-2022-23822: In this physical attack, an attacker may potentially exploit the Zynq-7000 SoC First Stage Boot Loader (FSBL) by bypassing authentication and loading a malicious image onto the device. This in turn may further allow the attacker to perform additional attacks such as such as using the device as a decryption oracle. An anticipated mitigation via a 2022.1 patch will resolve the issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-24778: The imgcrypt library provides API exensions for containerd to support encrypted container images and implements the ctd-decoder command line tool for use by containerd to decrypt encrypted container images. The imgcrypt function `CheckAuthorization` is supposed to check whether the current used is authorized to access an encrypted image and prevent the user from running an image that another user previously decrypted on the same system. In versions prior to 1.1.4, a failure occurs when an image with a ManifestList is used and the architecture of the local host is not the first one in the ManifestList. Only the first architecture in the list was tested, which may not have its layers available locally since it could not be run on the host architecture. Therefore, the verdict on unavailable layers was that the image could be run anticipating that image run failure would occur later due to the layers not being available. However, this verdict to allow the image to run enabled other architectures in the ManifestList to run an image without providing keys if that image had previously been decrypted. A patch has been applied to imgcrypt 1.1.4. Workarounds may include usage of different namespaces for each remote user.\n\n- CVE-2022-33174: Power Distribution Units running on Powertek firmware (multiple brands) before 3.30.30 allows remote authorization bypass in the web interface. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker must send an HTTP packet to the data retrieval interface (/cgi/get_param.cgi) with the tmpToken cookie set to an empty string followed by a semicolon. This bypasses an active session authorization check. This can be then used to fetch the values of protected sys.passwd and sys.su.name fields that contain the username and password in cleartext.\n\n- CVE-2021-22240: Improper access control in GitLab EE versions 13.11.6, 13.12.6, and 14.0.2 allows users to be created via single sign on despite user cap being enabled\n\n- CVE-2021-35112: A user with user level permission can access graphics protected region due to improper access control in register configuration in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Mobile, Snapdragon Voice & Music, Snapdragon Wearables\n\n- CVE-2021-37409: Improper access control for some Intel(R) PROSet/Wireless WiFi and Killer(TM) WiFi products may allow a privileged user to potentially enable escalation of privilege via local access.\n\n- CVE-2022-0574: Improper Access Control in GitHub repository publify/publify prior to 9.2.8.\n\n- CVE-2022-1944: When the feature is configured, improper authorization in the Interactive Web Terminal in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions from 11.3 prior to 14.9.5, 14.10 prior to 14.10.4, and 15.0 prior to 15.0.1 allows users with the Developer role to open terminals on other Developers' running jobs\n\n- CVE-2022-2095: An improper access control check in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions starting from 13.7 before 15.0.5, all versions starting from 15.1 before 15.1.4, all versions starting from 15.2 before 15.2.1 allows a malicious authenticated user to view a public project's Deploy Key's public fingerprint and name when that key has write permission. Note that GitLab never asks for nor stores the private key.\n\n- CVE-2022-23488: BigBlueButton is an open source web conferencing system. Versions prior to 2.4-rc-6 are vulnerable to Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data. The moderators-only webcams lock setting is not enforced on the backend, which allows an attacker to subscribe to viewers' webcams, even when the lock setting is applied. (The required streamId was being sent to all users even with lock setting applied). This issue is fixed in version 2.4-rc-6. There are no workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-0406: Improper Authorization in GitHub repository janeczku/calibre-web prior to 0.6.16.\n\n- CVE-2022-35921: fof/byobu is a private discussions extension for Flarum forum. Affected versions were found to not respect private discussion disablement by users. Users of Byobu should update the extension to version 1.1.7, where this has been patched. Users of Byobu with Flarum 1.0 or 1.1 should upgrade to Flarum 1.2 or later, or evaluate the impact this issue has on your forum's users and choose to disable the extension if needed. There are no workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-41923: Grails Spring Security Core plugin is vulnerable to privilege escalation. The vulnerability allows an attacker access to one endpoint (i.e. the targeted endpoint) using the authorization requirements of a different endpoint (i.e. the donor endpoint). In some Grails framework applications, access to the targeted endpoint will be granted based on meeting the authorization requirements of the donor endpoint, which can result in a privilege escalation attack. This vulnerability has been patched in grails-spring-security-core versions 3.3.2, 4.0.5 and 5.1.1. Impacted Applications: Grails Spring Security Core plugin versions: 1.x 2.x >=3.0.0 <3.3.2 >=4.0.0 <4.0.5 >=5.0.0 <5.1.1 We strongly suggest that all Grails framework applications using the Grails Spring Security Core plugin be updated to a patched release of the plugin. Workarounds: Users should create a subclass extending one of the following classes from the `grails.plugin.springsecurity.web.access.intercept` package, depending on their security configuration: * `AnnotationFilterInvocationDefinition` * `InterceptUrlMapFilterInvocationDefinition` * `RequestmapFilterInvocationDefinition` In each case, the subclass should override the `calculateUri` method like so: ``` @Override protected String calculateUri(HttpServletRequest request) { UrlPathHelper.defaultInstance.getRequestUri(request) } ``` This should be considered a temporary measure, as the patched versions of grails-spring-security-core deprecates the `calculateUri` method. Once upgraded to a patched version of the plugin, this workaround is no longer needed. The workaround is especially important for version 2.x, as no patch is available version 2.x of the GSSC plugin.\n\n- CVE-2022-0580: Incorrect Authorization in Packagist librenms/librenms prior to 22.2.0. \n\n- CVE-2022-1223: Incorrect Authorization in GitHub repository phpipam/phpipam prior to 1.4.6. \n\n- CVE-2022-0117: Policy bypass in Blink in Google Chrome prior to 97.0.4692.71 allowed a remote attacker to leak cross-origin data via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2022-0334: A flaw was found in Moodle in versions 3.11 to 3.11.4, 3.10 to 3.10.8, 3.9 to 3.9.11 and earlier unsupported versions.

IBM X-Force ID: 231360.\n\n- CVE-2022-2408: The Guest account feature in Mattermost version 6.7.0 and earlier fails to properly restrict the permissions, which allows a guest user to fetch a list of all public channels in the team, in spite of not being part of those channels.\n\n- CVE-2022-0985: Insufficient capability checks could allow users with the moodle/site:uploadusers capability to delete users, without having the necessary moodle/user:delete capability.\n\n- CVE-2022-1460: An issue has been discovered in GitLab affecting all versions starting from 9.2 before 14.8.6, all versions starting from 14.9 before 14.9.4, all versions starting from 14.10 before 14.10.1. GitLab was not performing correct authorizations on scheduled pipelines allowing a malicious user to run a pipeline in the context of another user.\n\n- CVE-2022-24748: Shopware is an open commerce platform based on the Symfony php Framework and the Vue javascript framework. In versions prior to 6.4.8.2 it is possible to modify customers and to create orders without App Permission. This issue is a result of improper api route checking. Users are advised to upgrade to version 6.4.8.2. There are no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-25335: RigoBlock Dragos through 2022-02-17 lacks the onlyOwner modifier for setMultipleAllowances. This enables token manipulation, as exploited in the wild in February 2022. NOTE: although 2022-02-17 is the vendor's vulnerability announcement date, the vulnerability will not be remediated until a major protocol upgrade occurs.\n\n- CVE-2022-36103: Talos Linux is a Linux distribution built for Kubernetes deployments. Talos worker nodes use a join token to get accepted into the Talos cluster. Due to improper validation of the request while signing a worker node CSR (certificate signing request) Talos control plane node might issue Talos API certificate which allows full access to Talos API on a control plane node. Accessing Talos API with full level access on a control plane node might reveal sensitive information which allows full level access to the cluster (Kubernetes and Talos PKI, etc.). Talos API join token is stored in the machine configuration on the worker node. When configured correctly, Kubernetes workloads don't have access to the machine configuration, but due to a misconfiguration workload might access the machine configuration and reveal the join token. This problem has been fixed in Talos 1.2.2. Enabling the Pod Security Standards mitigates the vulnerability by denying hostPath mounts and host networking by default in the baseline policy. Clusters that don't run untrusted workloads are not affected. Clusters with correct Pod Security configurations which don't allow hostPath mounts, and secure access to cloud metadata server (or machine configuration is not supplied via cloud metadata server) are not affected.\n\n- CVE-2022-46792: Hasura GraphQL Engine before 2.15.2 mishandles row-level authorization in the Update Many API for Postgres backends. The fixed versions are 2.10.2, 2.11.3, 2.12.1, 2.13.2, 2.14.1, and 2.15.2. (Versions before 2.10.0 are unaffected.)\n\n- CVE-2022-3048: Inappropriate implementation in Chrome OS lockscreen in Google Chrome on Chrome OS prior to 105.0.5195.52 allowed a local attacker to bypass lockscreen navigation restrictions via physical access to the device.\n\n- CVE-2021-30538: Insufficient policy enforcement in content security policy in Google Chrome prior to 91.0.4472.77 allowed a remote attacker to bypass content security policy via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-30539: Insufficient policy enforcement in content security policy in Google Chrome prior to 91.0.4472.77 allowed a remote attacker to bypass content security policy via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-31876: Bitcoin Core 0.12.0 through 0.21.1 does not properly implement the replacement policy specified in BIP125, which makes it easier for attackers to trigger a loss of funds, or a denial of service attack against downstream projects such as Lightning network nodes. An unconfirmed child transaction with nSequence = 0xff_ff_ff_ff, spending an unconfirmed parent with nSequence <= 0xff_ff_ff_fd, should be replaceable because there is inherited signaling by the child transaction. However, the actual PreChecks implementation does not enforce this. Instead, mempool rejects the replacement attempt of the unconfirmed child transaction.\n\n- CVE-2021-3763: A flaw was found in the Red Hat AMQ Broker management console in version 7.8 where an existing user is able to access some limited information even when the role the user is assigned to should not be allow access to the management console. The main impact is to confidentiality as this flaw means some role bindings are incorrectly checked, some privileged meta information such as queue names and configuration details are disclosed but the impact is limited as not all information is accessible and there is no affect to integrity.\n\n- CVE-2021-39206: Pomerium is an open source identity-aware access proxy. Envoy, which Pomerium is based on, contains two authorization related vulnerabilities CVE-2021-32777 and CVE-2021-32779. This may lead to incorrect routing or authorization policy decisions. With specially crafted requests, incorrect authorization or routing decisions may be made by Pomerium. Pomerium v0.14.8 and v0.15.1 contain an upgraded envoy binary with these vulnerabilities patched. This issue can only be triggered when using path prefix based policy. Removing any such policies should provide mitigation.\n\n- CVE-2022-0333: A flaw was found in Moodle in versions 3.11 to 3.11.4, 3.10 to 3.10.8, 3.9 to 3.9.11 and earlier unsupported versions. The calendar:manageentries capability allowed managers to access or modify any calendar event, but should have been restricted from accessing user level events.\n\n- CVE-2022-0633: The UpdraftPlus WordPress plugin Free before 1.22.3 and Premium before 2.22.3 do not properly validate a user has the required privileges to access a backup's nonce identifier, which may allow any users with an account on the site (such as subscriber) to download the most recent site & database backup.\n\n- CVE-2022-0740: Incorrect authorization in the Asana integration's branch restriction feature in all versions of GitLab CE/EE starting from version 7.8.0 before 14.7.7, all versions starting from 14.8 before 14.8.5, all versions starting from 14.9 before 14.9.2 makes it possible to close Asana tasks from unrestricted branches.\n\n- CVE-2022-0825: The Amelia WordPress plugin before 1.0.49 does not have proper authorisation when managing appointments, allowing any customer to update other's booking status, as well as retrieve sensitive information about the bookings, such as the full name and phone number of the person who booked it.\n\n- CVE-2022-1935: Incorrect authorization in GitLab EE affecting all versions from 12.0 before 14.9.5, all versions starting from 14.10 before 14.10.4, all versions starting from 15.0 before 15.0.1 allowed an attacker already in possession of a valid Project Trigger Token to misuse it from any location even when IP address restrictions were configured\n\n- CVE-2022-1936: Incorrect authorization in GitLab EE affecting all versions from 12.0 before 14.9.5, all versions starting from 14.10 before 14.10.4, all versions starting from 15.0 before 15.0.1 allowed an attacker already in possession of a valid Project Deploy Token to misuse it from any location even when IP address restrictions were configured\n\n- CVE-2022-1981: An issue has been discovered in GitLab EE affecting all versions starting from 12.2 prior to 14.10.5, 15.0 prior to 15.0.4, and 15.1 prior to 15.1.1. In GitLab, if a group enables the setting to restrict access to users belonging to specific domains, that allow-list may be bypassed if a Maintainer uses the 'Invite a group' feature to invite a group that has members that don't comply with domain allow-list.\n\n- CVE-2022-21701: Istio is an open platform to connect, manage, and secure microservices. In versions 1.12.0 and 1.12.1 Istio is vulnerable to a privilege escalation attack. Users who have `CREATE` permission for `gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io` objects can escalate this privilege to create other resources that they may not have access to, such as `Pod`. This vulnerability impacts only an Alpha level feature, the Kubernetes Gateway API. This is not the same as the Istio Gateway type (gateways.networking.istio.io), which is not vulnerable. Users are advised to upgrade to resolve this issue. Users unable to upgrade should implement any of the following which will prevent this vulnerability: Remove the gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io CustomResourceDefinition, set PILOT_ENABLE_GATEWAY_API_DEPLOYMENT_CONTROLLER=true environment variable in Istiod, or remove CREATE permissions for gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io objects from untrusted users.\n\n- CVE-2022-22326: IBM Datapower Gateway 10.0.2.0 through 10.0.4.0, 10.0.1.0 through 10.0.1.5, and 2018.4.1.0 through 2018.4.1.18 could allow unauthorized viewing of logs and files due to insufficient authorization checks. IBM X-Force ID: 218856.\n\n- CVE-2022-23490: BigBlueButton is an open source web conferencing system. Versions prior to 2.4.0 expose sensitive information to Unauthorized Actors. This issue affects meetings with polls, where the attacker is a meeting participant. Subscribing to the current-poll collection does not update the client UI, but does give the attacker access to the contents of the collection, which include the individual poll responses. This issue is patched in version 2.4.0. There are no workarounds. \n\n- CVE-2022-23615: XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. In affected versions any user with SCRIPT right can save a document with the right of the current user which allow accessing API requiring programming right if the current user has programming right. This has been patched in XWiki 13.0. Users are advised to update to resolve this issue. The only known workaround is to limit SCRIPT access.\n\n- CVE-2022-23627: ArchiSteamFarm (ASF) is a C# application with primary purpose of idling Steam cards from multiple accounts simultaneously. Due to a bug in ASF code, introduced in version V5.2.2.2, the program didn't adequately verify effective access of the user sending proxy (i.e. `[Bots]`) commands. In particular, a proxy-like command sent to bot `A` targeting bot `B` has incorrectly verified user's access against bot `A` - instead of bot `B`, to which the command was originally designated. This in result allowed access to resources beyond those configured, being a security threat affecting confidentiality of other bot instances. A successful attack exploiting this bug requires a significant access granted explicitly by original owner of the ASF process prior to that, as attacker has to control at least a single bot in the process to make use of this inadequate access verification loophole. The issue is patched in ASF V5.2.2.5, V5.2.3.2 and future versions. Users are advised to update as soon as possible.\n\n- CVE-2022-23739: An incorrect authorization vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server, allowing for escalation of privileges in GraphQL API requests from GitHub Apps. This vulnerability allowed an app installed on an organization to gain access to and modify most organization-level resources that are not tied to a repository regardless of granted permissions, such as users and organization-wide projects. Resources associated with repositories were not impacted, such as repository file content, repository-specific projects, issues, or pull requests. This vulnerability affected all versions of GitHub Enterprise Server prior to 3.7.1 and was fixed in versions 3.3.16, 3.4.11, 3.5.8, 3.6.4, 3.7.1.

Installations of Icinga 2 with the IDO writer enabled are affected. If you use service custom variables in role restrictions, and you regularly decommission service objects, users with said roles may still have access to a collection of content. Note that this only applies if a role has implicitly permitted access to hosts, due to permitted access to at least one of their services. If access to a host is permitted by other means, no sensible information has been disclosed to unauthorized users. This issue has been resolved in versions 2.8.6, 2.9.6 and 2.10 of Icinga Web 2.\n\n- CVE-2022-24721: CometD is a scalable comet implementation for web messaging. In any version prior to 5.0.11, 6.0.6, and 7.0.6, internal usage of Oort and Seti channels is improperly authorized, so any remote user could subscribe and publish to those channels. By subscribing to those channels, a remote user may be able to watch cluster-internal traffic that contains other users' (possibly sensitive) data. By publishing to those channels, a remote user may be able to create/modify/delete other user's data and modify the cluster structure. A fix is available in versions 5.0.11, 6.0.6, and 7.0.6. As a workaround, install a custom `SecurityPolicy` that forbids subscription and publishing to remote, non-Oort, sessions on Oort and Seti channels.\n\n- CVE-2022-2597: The Visual Portfolio, Photo Gallery & Post Grid WordPress plugin before 2.19.0 does not have proper authorisation checks in some of its REST endpoints, allowing users with a role as low as contributor to call them and inject arbitrary CSS in arbitrary saved layouts\n\n- CVE-2022-26767: The issue was addressed with additional permissions checks.

In versions 5.3 until 9.0.3, 8.5.9, 8.4.10, and 8.3.10, it is possible for a malicious user who has authorization to log into a Grafana instance via a configured OAuth IdP which provides a login name to take over the account of another user in that Grafana instance. This can occur when the malicious user is authorized to log in to Grafana via OAuth, the malicious user's external user id is not already associated with an account in Grafana, the malicious user's email address is not already associated with an account in Grafana, and the malicious user knows the Grafana username of the target user. If these conditions are met, the malicious user can set their username in the OAuth provider to that of the target user, then go through the OAuth flow to log in to Grafana. Due to the way that external and internal user accounts are linked together during login, if the conditions above are all met then the malicious user will be able to log in to the target user's Grafana account. Versions 9.0.3, 8.5.9, 8.4.10, and 8.3.10 contain a patch for this issue. As a workaround, concerned users can disable OAuth login to their Grafana instance, or ensure that all users authorized to log in via OAuth have a corresponding user account in Grafana linked to their email address.\n\n- CVE-2022-31155: Sourcegraph is an opensource code search and navigation engine.

JDPI incorrectly classifies out-of-state asymmetric TCP flows as the dynamic-application INCONCLUSIVE instead of UNKNOWN, which is more permissive, causing the firewall to allow traffic to be forwarded that should have been denied. This issue only occurs when 'set security flow tcp-session no-syn-check' is configured on the device. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series: 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R2-S9, 18.4R3-S9; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R2-S3, 19.1R3-S6; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S7, 19.2R3-S3; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R2-S6, 19.3R3-S2; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R2-S5, 19.4R3-S3; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R2-S2, 20.1R3; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R3-S1; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R3; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R2-S1, 20.4R3; 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R1-S1, 21.1R2.

While JDPI correctly classifies out-of-state asymmetric TCP flows as the dynamic-application UNKNOWN, this classification is not provided to the policy module properly and hence traffic continues to use the pre-id-default-policy, which is more permissive, causing the firewall to allow traffic to be forwarded that should have been denied. This issue only occurs when 'set security flow tcp-session no-syn-check' is configured on the device. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series: 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R2-S10, 18.4R3-S10; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R3-S8; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S8, 19.2R3-S4; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R3-S3; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R3-S5; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R3-S1; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R3-S2; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R3-S1; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R2-S2, 20.4R3; 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R2-S2, 21.1R3; 21.2 versions prior to 21.2R2.

Other users could see information such as command line arguments or environment variable settings. When this data contains sensitive information such as credentials, it might allow other users to launch an attack against the product or related resources.\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2005-1387: password passed on command line\n\n- CVE-2005-2291: password passed on command line\n\n- CVE-2001-1565: username/password on command line allows local users to view via \"ps\" or other process listing programs\n\n- CVE-2004-1948: Username/password on command line allows local users to view via \"ps\" or other process listing programs.\n\n- CVE-1999-1270: PGP passphrase provided as command line argument.\n\n- CVE-2004-1058: Kernel race condition allows reading of environment variables of a process that is still spawning.\n\n- CVE-2021-32638: Code analysis product passes access tokens as a command-line parameter or through an environment variable, making them visible to other processes via the ps command.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-1753: A security flaw was found in Ansible Engine, all Ansible 2.7.x versions prior to 2.7.17, all Ansible 2.8.x versions prior to 2.8.11 and all Ansible 2.9.x versions prior to 2.9.7, when managing kubernetes using the k8s module. Sensitive parameters such as passwords and tokens are passed to kubectl from the command line, not using an environment variable or an input configuration file. This will disclose passwords and tokens from process list and no_log directive from debug module would not have any effect making these secrets being disclosed on stdout and log files.\n\n- CVE-2021-32638: Github's CodeQL action is provided to run CodeQL-based code scanning on non-GitHub CI/CD systems and requires a GitHub access token to connect to a GitHub repository. The runner and its documentation previously suggested passing the GitHub token as a command-line parameter to the process instead of reading it from a file, standard input, or an environment variable. This approach made the token visible to other processes on the same machine, for example in the output of the `ps` command. If the CI system publicly exposes the output of `ps`, for example by logging the output, then the GitHub access token can be exposed beyond the scope intended. Users of the CodeQL runner on 3rd-party systems, who are passing a GitHub token via the `--github-auth` flag, are affected. This applies to both GitHub.com and GitHub Enterprise users. Users of the CodeQL Action on GitHub Actions are not affected. The `--github-auth` flag is now considered insecure and deprecated. The undocumented `--external-repository-token` flag has been removed. To securely provide a GitHub access token to the CodeQL runner, users should **do one of the following instead**: Use the `--github-auth-stdin` flag and pass the token on the command line via standard input OR set the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable to contain the token, then call the command without passing in the token. The old flag remains present for backwards compatibility with existing workflows. If the user tries to specify an access token using the `--github-auth` flag, there is a deprecation warning printed to the terminal that directs the user to one of the above options. All CodeQL runner releases codeql-bundle-20210304 onwards contain the patches. We recommend updating to a recent version of the CodeQL runner, storing a token in your CI system's secret storage mechanism, and passing the token to the CodeQL runner using `--github-auth-stdin` or the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable. If still using the old flag, ensure that process output, such as from `ps`, is not persisted in CI logs.\n\n- CVE-2022-31238: Dell PowerScale OneFS, versions 9.0.0 up to and including 9.1.0.19, 9.2.1.12, 9.3.0.6, and 9.4.0.2, contain a process invoked with sensitive information vulnerability. A CLI user may potentially exploit this vulnerability, leading to information disclosure.\n\n- CVE-2022-30586: Gradle Enterprise through 2022.2.2 has Incorrect Access Control that leads to code execution.\n\n- CVE-2022-0235: node-fetch is vulnerable to Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n\n- CVE-2022-0851: There is a flaw in convert2rhel. When the --activationkey option is used with convert2rhel, the activation key is subsequently passed to subscription-manager via the command line, which could allow unauthorized users locally on the machine to view the activation key via the process command line via e.g. htop or ps. The specific impact varies upon the subscription, but generally this would allow an attacker to register systems purchased by the victim until discovered; a form of fraud. This could occur regardless of how the activation key is supplied to convert2rhel because it involves how convert2rhel provides it to subscription-manager.\n\n- CVE-2022-1662: In convert2rhel, there's an ansible playbook named ansible/run-convert2rhel.yml which passes the Red Hat Subscription Manager user password via the CLI to convert2rhel. This could allow unauthorized local users to view the password via the process list while convert2rhel is running. However, this ansible playbook is only an example in the upstream repository and it is not shipped in officially supported versions of convert2rhel.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-497 (ChildOf)",

A malicious user can modify the contents of a `confirmation_token` input during the two-factor authentication process to reference a cache value not associated with the login attempt. In rare cases this can allow a malicious actor to authenticate as a random user in the Panel. The malicious user must target an account with two-factor authentication enabled, and then must provide a correct two-factor authentication token before being authenticated as that user. Due to a validation flaw in the logic handling user authentication during the two-factor authentication process a malicious user can trick the system into loading credentials for an arbitrary user by modifying the token sent to the server. This authentication flaw is present in the `LoginCheckpointController@__invoke` method which handles two-factor authentication for a user. This controller looks for a request input parameter called `confirmation_token` which is expected to be a 64 character random alpha-numeric string that references a value within the Panel's cache containing a `user_id` value. This value is then used to fetch the user that attempted to login, and lookup their two-factor authentication token. Due to the design of this system, any element in the cache that contains only digits could be referenced by a malicious user, and whatever value is stored at that position would be used as the `user_id`. There are a few different areas of the Panel that store values into the cache that are integers, and a user who determines what those cache keys are could pass one of those keys which would cause this code pathway to reference an arbitrary user. At its heart this is a high-risk login bypass vulnerability. However, there are a few additional conditions that must be met in order for this to be successfully executed, notably: 1.) The account referenced by the malicious cache key must have two-factor authentication enabled. An account without two-factor authentication would cause an exception to be triggered by the authentication logic, thusly exiting this authentication flow. 2.) Even if the malicious user is able to reference a valid cache key that references a valid user account with two-factor authentication, they must provide a valid two-factor authentication token. However, due to the design of this endpoint once a valid user account is found with two-factor authentication enabled there is no rate-limiting present, thusly allowing an attacker to brute force combinations until successful. This leads to a third condition that must be met: 3.) For the duration of this attack sequence the cache key being referenced must continue to exist with a valid `user_id` value. Depending on the specific key being used for this attack, this value may disappear quickly, or be changed by other random user interactions on the Panel, outside the control of the attacker. In order to mitigate this vulnerability the underlying authentication logic was changed to use an encrypted session store that the user is therefore unable to control the value of. This completely removed the use of a user-controlled value being used. In addition, the code was audited to ensure this type of vulnerability is not present elsewhere.\n\n- CVE-2021-42338: 4MOSAn GCB Doctor\u2019s login page has improper validation of Cookie, which allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to bypass authentication by code injection in cookie, and arbitrarily manipulate the system or interrupt services by upload and execution of arbitrary files.\n\n- CVE-2021-1541: Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business 220 Series Smart Switches could allow an attacker to do the following: Hijack a user session Execute arbitrary commands as a root user on the underlying operating system Conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack Conduct an HTML injection attack For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2021-41317: XSS Hunter Express before 2021-09-17 does not properly enforce authentication requirements for paths.\n\n- CVE-2021-29012: DMA Softlab Radius Manager 4.4.0 assigns the same session cookie to every admin session.

This affects users of spnego-http-auth-nginx-module that have enabled basic authentication. This is fixed in version 1.1.1 of spnego-http-auth-nginx-module. As a workaround, one may disable basic authentication.\n\n- CVE-2021-21378: Envoy is a cloud-native high-performance edge/middle/service proxy. In Envoy version 1.17.0 an attacker can bypass authentication by presenting a JWT token with an issuer that is not in the provider list when Envoy's JWT Authentication filter is configured with the `allow_missing` requirement under `requires_any` due to a mistake in implementation. Envoy's JWT Authentication filter can be configured with the `allow_missing` requirement that will be satisfied if JWT is missing (JwtMissed error) and fail if JWT is presented or invalid. Due to a mistake in implementation, a JwtUnknownIssuer error was mistakenly converted to JwtMissed when `requires_any` was configured. So if `allow_missing` was configured under `requires_any`, an attacker can bypass authentication by presenting a JWT token with an issuer that is not in the provider list. Integrity may be impacted depending on configuration if the JWT token is used to protect against writes or modifications. This regression was introduced on 2020/11/12 in PR 13839 which fixed handling `allow_missing` under RequiresAny in a JwtRequirement (see issue 13458). The AnyVerifier aggregates the children verifiers' results into a final status where JwtMissing is the default error. However, a JwtUnknownIssuer was mistakenly treated the same as a JwtMissing error and the resulting final aggregation was the default JwtMissing. As a result, `allow_missing` would allow a JWT token with an unknown issuer status. This is fixed in version 1.17.1 by PR 15194. The fix works by preferring JwtUnknownIssuer over a JwtMissing error, fixing the accidental conversion and bypass with `allow_missing`. A user could detect whether a bypass occurred if they have Envoy logs enabled with debug verbosity. Users can enable component level debug logs for JWT.

Versions prior to 4.9.1 expose a limited ability to spoof SAML authentication with missing audience verification. This impacts deployments using SAML SSO in two specific cases: 1. A malicious or compromised Service Provider (SP) could reuse the SAML response to log into Fleet as a user -- only if the user has an account with the same email in Fleet, _and_ the user signs into the malicious SP via SAML SSO from the same Identity Provider (IdP) configured with Fleet. 2. A user with an account in Fleet could reuse a SAML response intended for another SP to log into Fleet. This is only a concern if the user is blocked from Fleet in the IdP, but continues to have an account in Fleet. If the user is blocked from the IdP entirely, this cannot be exploited. Fleet 4.9.1 resolves this issue. Users unable to upgrade should: Reduce the length of sessions on your IdP to reduce the window for malicious re-use, Limit the amount of SAML Service Providers/Applications used by user accounts with access to Fleet, and When removing access to Fleet in the IdP, delete the Fleet user from Fleet as well.\n\n- CVE-2022-24259: An incorrect check in the component cdr.php of Voipmonitor GUI before v24.96 allows unauthenticated attackers to escalate privileges via a crafted request.\n\n- CVE-2022-24883: FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).

Other authentication methods (LDAP, OpenID Connect) supported by Arvados are not affected by this flaw. This issue is patched in version 2.4.3. Workaround for this issue is to migrate to a different authentication method supported by Arvados, such as LDAP.\n\n- CVE-2022-39263: `@next-auth/upstash-redis-adapter` is the Upstash Redis adapter for NextAuth.js, which provides authentication for Next.js. Applications that use `next-auth` Email Provider and `@next-auth/upstash-redis-adapter` before v3.0.2 are affected by this vulnerability. The Upstash Redis adapter implementation did not check for both the identifier (email) and the token, but only checking for the identifier when verifying the token in the email callback flow. An attacker who knows about the victim's email could easily sign in as the victim, given the attacker also knows about the verification token's expired duration. The vulnerability is patched in v3.0.2. A workaround is available. Using Advanced Initialization, developers can check the requests and compare the query's token and identifier before proceeding.\n\n- CVE-2022-39355: Discourse Patreon enables syncronization between Discourse Groups and Patreon rewards. On sites with Patreon login enabled, an improper authentication vulnerability could be used to take control of a victim's forum account. This vulnerability is patched in commit number 846d012151514b35ce42a1636c7d70f6dcee879e of the discourse-patreon plugin. Out of an abundance of caution, any Discourse accounts which have logged in with an unverified-email Patreon account will be logged out and asked to verify their email address on their next login. As a workaround, disable the patreon integration and log out all users with associated Patreon accounts.\n\n- CVE-2021-3632: A flaw was found in Keycloak. This vulnerability allows anyone to register a new security device or key when there is not a device already registered for any user by using the WebAuthn password-less login flow.\n\n- CVE-2022-46170: CodeIgniter is a PHP full-stack web framework. When an application uses (1) multiple session cookies (e.g., one for user pages and one for admin pages) and (2) a session handler is set to `DatabaseHandler`, `MemcachedHandler`, or `RedisHandler`, then if an attacker gets one session cookie (e.g., one for user pages), they may be able to access pages that require another session cookie (e.g., for admin pages). This issue has been patched, please upgrade to version 4.2.11 or later. As a workaround, use only one session cookie.\n\n- CVE-2022-46316: A thread security vulnerability exists in the authentication process. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may affect data integrity, confidentiality, and availability.\n\n- CVE-2022-30034: Flower, a web UI for the Celery Python RPC framework, all versions as of 05-02-2022 is vulnerable to an OAuth authentication bypass.

The use of an authentication protocol in the proc server is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks, which can be exploited for local privilege escalation to get full root access.\n\n- CVE-2022-21684: Discourse is an open source discussion platform. Versions prior to 2.7.13 in `stable`, 2.8.0.beta11 in `beta`, and 2.8.0.beta11 in `tests-passed` allow some users to log in to a community before they should be able to do so. A user invited via email to a forum with `must_approve_users` enabled is going to be automatically logged in, bypassing the check that does not allow unapproved users to sign in. They will be able to do everything an approved user can do. If they logout, they cannot log back in. This issue is patched in the `stable` version 2.7.13, `beta` version 2.8.0.beta11, and `tests-passed` version 2.8.0.beta11. One may disable invites as a workaround. Administrators can increase `min_trust_level_to_allow_invite` to reduce the attack surface to more trusted users.\n\n- CVE-2022-2303: An issue has been discovered in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions before 15.0.5, all versions starting from 15.1 before 15.1.4, all versions starting from 15.2 before 15.2.1.

This allows an attacker to use one AK, EK pair from a real TPM to pass EK validation and give the verifier an AK of a software TPM. A successful attack breaks the entire chain of trust because a not validated AK is used by the verifier. This issue is worse if the validation happens first and then the agent gets added to the verifier because the timing is easier and the verifier does not validate the regcount entry being equal to 1,\n\n- CVE-2022-45124: An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the User authentication functionality of WellinTech KingHistorian 35.01.00.05. A specially crafted network packet can lead to a disclosure of sensitive information.

Tower runs a memcached, which is accessed via TCP. An attacker can take advantage of writing a playbook polluting this cache, causing a denial of service attack. This attack would not completely stop the service, but in the worst-case scenario, it can reduce the Tower performance, for which memcached is designed. Theoretically, more sophisticated attacks can be performed by manipulating and crafting the cache, as Tower relies on memcached as a place to pull out setting values. Confidential and sensitive data stored in memcached should not be pulled, as this information is encrypted. This flaw affects Ansible Tower versions before 3.6.4, Ansible Tower versions before 3.5.6 and Ansible Tower versions before 3.4.6.\n\n- CVE-2021-1839: The issue was addressed with improved permissions logic.

Within the context of vulnerability theory, there is a similarity between the OWASP concept and CWE-706: Use of Incorrectly-Resolved Name or Reference.\nBroken Object Level Authorization / BOLA - BOLA is used in the 2019 OWASP API Security Top 10 and is said to be the same as IDOR.\nHorizontal Authorization - \"Horizontal Authorization\" is used to describe situations in which two users have the same privilege level, but must be prevented from accessing each other's resources. This is fairly common when using key-based access to resources in a multi-user context.\n\nDescription:\n\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\nExtended Details:\n\n\n\nRetrieval of a user record occurs in the system based on some key value that is under user control. The key would typically identify a user-related record stored in the system and would be used to lookup that record for presentation to the user. It is likely that an attacker would have to be an authenticated user in the system. However, the authorization process would not properly check the data access operation to ensure that the authenticated user performing the operation has sufficient entitlements to perform the requested data access, hence bypassing any other authorization checks present in the system.\n\n\nFor example, attackers can look at places where user specific data is retrieved (e.g. search screens) and determine whether the key for the item being looked up is controllable externally. The key may be a hidden field in the HTML form field, might be passed as a URL parameter or as an unencrypted cookie variable, then in each of these cases it will be possible to tamper with the key value.\n\n\nOne manifestation of this weakness is when a system uses sequential or otherwise easily-guessable session IDs that would allow one user to easily switch to another user's session and read/modify their data.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-36539: An educational application does not appropriately restrict file IDs to a particular user. The attacker can brute-force guess IDs, indicating IDOR.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-26679: vFairs 3.3 is affected by Insecure Permissions.

Several APIs on the web system display, without authorization, sensitive information such as health statements, previous bills in a specific restaurant, alcohol consumption and smoking habits. Each of the described API\u2019s, has in its URL one or more MongoDB ID which is not so simple to enumerate. However, they each receive a \u2018tiny URL\u2019 in Tabit\u2019s domain, in the form of https://tbit.be/{suffix} with suffix being a 5 characters long string containing numbers, lower- and upper-case letters. It is not so simple to enumerate them all, but really easy to find some that work and lead to a personal endpoint. This is both an example of OWASP: API4 - rate limiting and OWASP: API1 - Broken object level authorization. Furthermore, the redirect URL disclosed the MongoDB IDs discussed above, and we could use them to query other endpoints disclosing more personal information. For example: The URL https://tabitisrael.co.il/online-reservations/health-statement?orgId={org_id}&healthStatementId={health_statement_id} is used to invite friends to fill a health statement before attending the restaurant. We can use the health_statement_id to access the https://tgm-api.tabit.cloud/health-statement/{health_statement_id} API which disclose medical information as well as id number.\n\n- CVE-2022-36202: Doctor's Appointment System1.0 is vulnerable to Incorrect Access Control via edoc/patient/settings.php.

A sync token is used in Seafile file syncing protocol to authorize access to library data. To improve performance, the token is cached in memory in seaf-server. Upon receiving a token from sync client or SeaDrive client, the server checks whether the token exist in the cache. However, if the token exists in cache, the server doesn't check whether it's associated with the specific library in the URL. This vulnerability makes it possible to use any valid sync token to access data from any **known** library. Note that the attacker has to first find out the ID of a library which it has no access to. The library ID is a random UUID, which is not possible to be guessed. There are no workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-1949: An access control bypass vulnerability found in 389-ds-base.

Due to a bug in ASF code `POST /Api/ASF` ASF API endpoint responsible for updating global ASF config incorrectly removed `IPCPassword` from the resulting config when the caller did not specify it explicitly. Due to the above, it was possible for the user to accidentally remove `IPCPassword` security measure from his IPC interface when updating global ASF config, which exists as part of global config update functionality in ASF-ui. Removal of `IPCPassword` possesses a security risk, as unauthorized users may in result access the IPC interface after such modification. The issue is patched in ASF V5.1.2.4 and future versions. We recommend to manually verify that `IPCPassword` is specified after update, and if not, set it accordingly. In default settings, ASF is configured to allow IPC access from `localhost` only and should not affect majority of users.\n\n- CVE-2021-3282: HashiCorp Vault Enterprise 1.6.0 & 1.6.1 allowed the `remove-peer` raft operator command to be executed against DR secondaries without authentication. Fixed in 1.6.2.\n\n- CVE-2021-34675: Basix NEX-Forms through 7.8.7 allows authentication bypass for stored PDF reports.\n\n- CVE-2021-34676: Basix NEX-Forms through 7.8.7 allows authentication bypass for Excel report generation.\n\n- CVE-2021-35941: Western Digital WD My Book Live (2.x and later) and WD My Book Live Duo (all versions) have an administrator API that can perform a system factory restore without authentication, as exploited in the wild in June 2021, a different vulnerability than CVE-2018-18472.\n\n- CVE-2021-37415: Zoho ManageEngine ServiceDesk Plus before 11302 is vulnerable to authentication bypass that allows a few REST-API URLs without authentication.\n\n- CVE-2021-37420: Zoho ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus before 6112 is vulnerable to mail spoofing.\n\n- CVE-2021-37624: FreeSWITCH is a Software Defined Telecom Stack enabling the digital transformation from proprietary telecom switches to a software implementation that runs on any commodity hardware. Prior to version 1.10.7, FreeSWITCH does not authenticate SIP MESSAGE requests, leading to spam and message spoofing. By default, SIP requests of the type MESSAGE (RFC 3428) are not authenticated in the affected versions of FreeSWITCH. MESSAGE requests are relayed to SIP user agents registered with the FreeSWITCH server without requiring any authentication. Although this behaviour can be changed by setting the `auth-messages` parameter to `true`, it is not the default setting. Abuse of this security issue allows attackers to send SIP MESSAGE messages to any SIP user agent that is registered with the server without requiring authentication. Additionally, since no authentication is required, chat messages can be spoofed to appear to come from trusted entities. Therefore, abuse can lead to spam and enable social engineering, phishing and similar attacks. This issue is patched in version 1.10.7. Maintainers recommend that this SIP message type is authenticated by default so that FreeSWITCH administrators do not need to be explicitly set the `auth-messages` parameter. When following such a recommendation, a new parameter can be introduced to explicitly disable authentication.\n\n- CVE-2021-38412: Properly formatted POST requests to multiple resources on the HTTP and HTTPS web servers of the Digi PortServer TS 16 Rack device do not require authentication or authentication tokens. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to enable the SNMP service and manipulate the community strings to achieve further control in.\n\n- CVE-2021-41157: FreeSWITCH is a Software Defined Telecom Stack enabling the digital transformation from proprietary telecom switches to a software implementation that runs on any commodity hardware. By default, SIP requests of the type SUBSCRIBE are not authenticated in the affected versions of FreeSWITCH. Abuse of this security issue allows attackers to subscribe to user agent event notifications without the need to authenticate. This abuse poses privacy concerns and might lead to social engineering or similar attacks. For example, attackers may be able to monitor the status of target SIP extensions. Although this issue was fixed in version v1.10.6, installations upgraded to the fixed version of FreeSWITCH from an older version, may still be vulnerable if the configuration is not updated accordingly. Software upgrades do not update the configuration by default. SIP SUBSCRIBE messages should be authenticated by default so that FreeSWITCH administrators do not need to explicitly set the `auth-subscriptions` parameter. When following such a recommendation, a new parameter can be introduced to explicitly disable authentication.\n\n- CVE-2020-25566: In SapphireIMS 5.0, it is possible to take over an account by sending a request to the Save_Password form as shown in POC.

The device sends unnecessary information to the cloud controller server. Although this information is sent encrypted and has low risk in isolation, it decreases the privacy of the end user. The information sent includes the local IP address being used and the SSID of the Wi-Fi network the device is connected to. (Various resources such as wigle.net can be use for mapping of SSIDs to physical locations.)\n\n- CVE-2021-24170: The REST API endpoint get_users in the User Profile Picture WordPress plugin before 2.5.0 returned more information than was required for its functionality to users with the upload_files capability. This included password hashes, hashed user activation keys, usernames, emails, and other less sensitive information.\n\n- CVE-2021-24585: The Timetable and Event Schedule WordPress plugin before 2.4.0 outputs the Hashed Password, Username and Email Address (along other less sensitive data) of the user related to the Even Head of the Timeslot in the response when requesting the event Timeslot data with a user with the edit_posts capability. Combined with the other Unauthorised Event Timeslot Modification issue (https://wpscan.com/reports/submissions/4699/) where an arbitrary user ID can be set, this could allow low privilege users with the edit_posts capability (such as author) to retrieve sensitive User data by iterating over the user_id\n\n- CVE-2021-26566: Insertion of sensitive information into sent data vulnerability in synorelayd in Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM) before 6.2.3-25426-3 allows man-in-the-middle attackers to execute arbitrary commands via inbound QuickConnect traffic.\n\n- CVE-2021-22172: Improper authorization in GitLab 12.8+ allows a guest user in a private project to view tag data that should be inaccessible on the releases page\n\n- CVE-2021-26923: An issue was discovered in Argo CD before 1.8.4.

A compromised pod with sufficient privilege is able to reconfigure the node\u2019s IPv6 interface due to the node accepting route advertisement by default, allowing the attacker to redirect full or partial network traffic from the node to the compromised pod.\n\n- CVE-2020-14371: A credential leak vulnerability was found in Red Hat Satellite. This flaw exposes the compute resources credentials through VMs that are running on these resources in Satellite.\n\n- CVE-2021-20228: A flaw was found in the Ansible Engine 2.9.18, where sensitive info is not masked by default and is not protected by the no_log feature when using the sub-option feature of the basic.py module. This flaw allows an attacker to obtain sensitive information. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality.\n\n- CVE-2021-20331:  Specific versions of the MongoDB C# Driver may erroneously publish events containing authentication-related data to a command listener configured by an application. The published events may contain security-sensitive data when commands such as \"saslStart\", \"saslContinue\", \"isMaster\", \"createUser\", and \"updateUser\" are executed. Without due care, an application may inadvertently expose this authenticated-related information, e.g., by writing it to a log file. This issue only arises if an application enables the command listener feature (this is not enabled by default). This issue affects the MongoDB C# Driver v2.12 versions prior to and including 2.12.1. \n\n- CVE-2021-26593: In Directus 8.x through 8.8.1, an attacker can see all users in the CMS using the API /users/{id}. For each call, they get in response a lot of information about the user (such as email address, first name, and last name) but also the secret for 2FA if one exists. This secret can be regenerated. NOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer\n\n- CVE-2021-28133: Zoom through 5.5.4 sometimes allows attackers to read private information on a participant's screen, even though the participant never attempted to share the private part of their screen. When a user shares a specific application window via the Share Screen functionality, other meeting participants can briefly see contents of other application windows that were explicitly not shared. The contents of these other windows can (for instance) be seen for a short period of time when they overlay the shared window and get into focus. (An attacker can, of course, use a separate screen-recorder application, unsupported by Zoom, to save all such contents for later replays and analysis.) Depending on the unintentionally shared data, this short exposure of screen contents may be a more or less severe security issue.\n\n- CVE-2021-29483: ManageWiki is an extension to the MediaWiki project. The 'wikiconfig' API leaked the value of private configuration variables set through the ManageWiki variable to all users. This has been patched by https://github.com/miraheze/ManageWiki/compare/99f3b2c8af18...befb83c66f5b.patch. If you are unable to patch set `$wgAPIListModules['wikiconfig'] = 'ApiQueryDisabled';` or remove private config as a workaround.\n\n- CVE-2021-31545: An issue was discovered in the AbuseFilter extension for MediaWiki through 1.35.2.

The Special:AbuseFilter/examine form allowed for the disclosure of suppressed MediaWiki usernames to unprivileged users.\n\n- CVE-2021-32747: Icinga Web 2 is an open source monitoring web interface, framework, and command-line interface. A vulnerability in which custom variables are exposed to unauthorized users exists between versions 2.0.0 and 2.8.2. Custom variables are user-defined keys and values on configuration objects in Icinga 2. These are commonly used to reference secrets in other configurations such as check commands to be able to authenticate with a service being checked. Icinga Web 2 displays these custom variables to logged in users with access to said hosts or services. In order to protect the secrets from being visible to anyone, it's possible to setup protection rules and blacklists in a user's role. Protection rules result in `***` being shown instead of the original value, the key will remain. Backlists will hide a custom variable entirely from the user. Besides using the UI, custom variables can also be accessed differently by using an undocumented URL parameter. By adding a parameter to the affected routes, Icinga Web 2 will show these columns additionally in the respective list. This parameter is also respected when exporting to JSON or CSV. Protection rules and blacklists however have no effect in this case. Custom variables are shown as-is in the result. The issue has been fixed in the 2.9.0, 2.8.3, and 2.7.5 releases. As a workaround, one may set up a restriction to hide hosts and services with the custom variable in question.\n\n- CVE-2020-27831: A flaw was found in Red Hat Quay, where it does not properly protect the authorization token when authorizing email addresses for repository email notifications. This flaw allows an attacker to add email addresses they do not own to repository notifications.\n\n- CVE-2021-21396: wire-server is an open-source back end for Wire, a secure collaboration platform. In wire-server from version 2021-02-16 and before version 2021-03-02, the client metadata of all users was exposed in the `GET /users/list-clients` endpoint. The endpoint could be used by any logged in user who could request client details of any other user (no connection required) as far as they can find their User ID. The exposed metadata included id, class, type, location, time, and cookie. A user on a Wire backend could use this endpoint to find registration time and location for each device for a given list of users. As a workaround, remove `/list-clients` from nginx config. This has been fixed in version 2021-03-02.\n\n- CVE-2021-21400: wire-webapp is an open-source front end for Wire, a secure collaboration platform. In wire-webapp before version 2021-03-15-production.0, when being prompted to enter the app-lock passphrase, the typed passphrase will be sent into the most recently used chat when the user does not actively give focus to the input field. Input element focus is enforced programatically in version 2021-03-15-production.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-21621: Jenkins Support Core Plugin 2.72 and earlier provides the serialized user authentication as part of the \"About user (basic authentication details only)\" information, which can include the session ID of the user creating the support bundle in some configurations.\n\n- CVE-2021-21733: The management system of ZXCDN is impacted by the information leak vulnerability.

Prior to version 4.10.4, for regular (non-LiveQuery) queries, the session token is removed from the response, but for LiveQuery payloads it is currently not. If a user has a LiveQuery subscription on the `Parse.User` class, all session tokens created during user sign-ups will be broadcast as part of the LiveQuery payload. A patch in version 4.10.4 removes session tokens from the LiveQuery payload. As a workaround, set `user.acl(new Parse.ACL())` in a beforeSave trigger to make the user private already on sign-up.\n\n- CVE-2021-41125: Scrapy is a high-level web crawling and scraping framework for Python. If you use `HttpAuthMiddleware` (i.e. the `http_user` and `http_pass` spider attributes) for HTTP authentication, all requests will expose your credentials to the request target. This includes requests generated by Scrapy components, such as `robots.txt` requests sent by Scrapy when the `ROBOTSTXT_OBEY` setting is set to `True`, or as requests reached through redirects. Upgrade to Scrapy 2.5.1 and use the new `http_auth_domain` spider attribute to control which domains are allowed to receive the configured HTTP authentication credentials. If you are using Scrapy 1.8 or a lower version, and upgrading to Scrapy 2.5.1 is not an option, you may upgrade to Scrapy 1.8.1 instead. If you cannot upgrade, set your HTTP authentication credentials on a per-request basis, using for example the `w3lib.http.basic_auth_header` function to convert your credentials into a value that you can assign to the `Authorization` header of your request, instead of defining your credentials globally using `HttpAuthMiddleware`.\n\n- CVE-2021-42089: An issue was discovered in Zammad before 4.1.1. The REST API discloses sensitive information.\n\n- CVE-2021-0602: In onCreateOptionsMenu of WifiNetworkDetailsFragment.java, there is a possible way for guest users to view and modify Wi-Fi settings for all configured APs due to a permissions bypass.

When a node has been copied from a protected location, users with access to the copy can see the 'copyfrom' path of the original. This also reveals the fact that the node was copied. Only the 'copyfrom' path is revealed; not its contents. Both httpd and svnserve servers are vulnerable.\n\n- CVE-2021-45310: Sangoma Technologies Corporation Switchvox Version 102409 is affected by an information disclosure vulnerability due to an improper access restriction. Users information such as first name, last name, acount id, server uuid, email address, profile image, number, timestamps, etc can be extracted by sending an unauthenticated HTTP GET request to the https://Switchvox-IP/main?cmd=invalid_browser.\n\n- CVE-2021-25118: The Yoast SEO WordPress plugin (from versions 16.7 until 17.2) discloses the full internal path of featured images in posts via the wp/v2/posts REST endpoints which could help an attacker identify other vulnerabilities or help during the exploitation of other identified vulnerabilities.\n\n- CVE-2021-38956: IBM Security Verify 10.0.0, 10.0.1.0, and 10.0.2.0 could disclose sensitive version information in HTTP response headers that could aid in further attacks against the system.

When the scs-library-client is used to pull a container image, with authentication, the HTTP Authorization header sent by the client to the library service may be incorrectly leaked to an S3 backing storage provider. This occurs in a specific flow, where the library service redirects the client to a backing S3 storage server, to perform a multi-part concurrent download. Depending on site configuration, the S3 service may be provided by a third party. An attacker with access to the S3 service may be able to extract user credentials, allowing them to impersonate the user. The vulnerable multi-part concurrent download flow, with redirect to S3, is only used when communicating with a Singularity Enterprise 1.x installation, or third party server implementing this flow. Interaction with Singularity Enterprise 2.x, and Singularity Container Services (cloud.sylabs.io), does not trigger the vulnerable flow. We encourage all users to update. Users who interact with a Singularity Enterprise 1.x installation, using a 3rd party S3 storage service, are advised to revoke and recreate their authentication tokens within Singularity Enterprise. There is no workaround available at this time.\n\n- CVE-2022-31130: Grafana is an open source observability and data visualization platform.

Starting with version 2.2 and prior to versions 2.3.9 and 2.4-beta-1, an attacker can circumvent access controls to obtain the content of public chat messages from different meetings on the server. The attacker must be a participant in a meeting on the server. BigBlueButton versions 2.3.9 and 2.4-beta-1 contain a patch for this issue. There are currently no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-31069: NestJS Proxy is a NestJS module to decorate and proxy calls. Prior to version 0.7.0, the nestjs-proxy library did not have a way to control when Authorization headers should should be forwarded for specific backend services configured by the application developer. This could have resulted in sensitive information such as OAuth bearer access tokens being inadvertently exposed to such services that should not see them. A new feature has been introduced in the patched version of nestjs-proxy that allows application developers to opt out of forwarding the Authorization headers on a per service basis using the `forwardToken` config setting. Developers are advised to review the README for this library on Github or NPM for further details on how this configuration can be applied. This issue has been fixed in version 0.7.0 of `@finastra/nestjs-proxy`. Users of `@ffdc/nestjs-proxy` are advised that this package has been deprecated and is no longer being maintained or receiving updates. Such users should update their package.json file to use `@finastra/nestjs-proxy` instead.\n\n- CVE-2022-31070: NestJS Proxy is a NestJS module to decorate and proxy calls. Prior to version 0.7.0, the nestjs-proxy library did not have a way to block sensitive cookies (e.g. session cookies) from being forwarded to backend services configured by the application developer. This could have led to sensitive cookies being inadvertently exposed to such services that should not see them. The patched version now blocks cookies from being forwarded by default. However developers can configure an allow-list of cookie names by using the `allowedCookies` config setting. This issue has been fixed in version 0.7.0 of `@finastra/nestjs-proxy`. Users of `@ffdc/nestjs-proxy` are advised that this package has been deprecated and is no longer being maintained or receiving updates. Such users should update their package.json file to use `@finastra/nestjs-proxy` instead.\n\n- CVE-2022-3348: Just like in the previous report, an attacker could steal the account of different users. But in this case, it's a little bit more specific, because it is needed to be an editor in the same app as the victim.\n\n- CVE-2022-38113: This vulnerability discloses build and services versions in the server response header. \n\n- CVE-2022-46150: Discourse is an open-source discussion platform. Prior to version 2.8.13 of the `stable` branch and version 2.9.0.beta14 of the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches, unauthorized users may learn of the existence of hidden tags and that they have been applied to topics that they have access to. This issue is patched in version 2.8.13 of the `stable` branch and version 2.9.0.beta14 of the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches. As a workaround, use the `disable_email` site setting to disable all emails to non-staff users.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-200 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-209 (CanAlsoBe)\n\n- CWE-202 (CanAlsoBe)",

This will allow an attacker to send a NEWSCAN request to a listening agent on the network as well as receive the agent's HTTP request verifying its authtoken. In AEAgent.cpp, the agent responding back over HTTP is vulnerable to a Heap Overflow if the POST payload response is too large. The POST payload response is converted to Unicode using vswprintf. This is written to a buffer only 0x2000 bytes big. If POST payload is larger, then heap overflow will occur.\n\n- CVE-2021-20110: Due to Manage Engine Asset Explorer Agent 1.0.34 not validating HTTPS certificates, an attacker on the network can statically configure their IP address to match the Asset Explorer's Server IP address. This will allow an attacker to send a NEWSCAN request to a listening agent on the network as well as receive the agent's HTTP request verifying its authtoken. In httphandler.cpp, the agent reaching out over HTTP is vulnerable to an Integer Overflow, which can be turned into a Heap Overflow allowing for remote code execution as NT AUTHORITY/SYSTEM on the agent machine. The Integer Overflow occurs when receiving POST response from the Manage Engine server, and the agent calling \"HttpQueryInfoW\" in order to get the \"Content-Length\" size from the incoming POST request. This size is taken, but multiplied to a larger amount. If an attacker specifies a Content-Length size of 1073741823 or larger, this integer arithmetic will wrap the value back around to smaller integer, then calls \"calloc\" with this size to allocate memory. The following API \"InternetReadFile\" will copy the POST data into this buffer, which will be too small for the contents, and cause heap overflow.\n\n- CVE-2021-32728: The Nextcloud Desktop Client is a tool to synchronize files from Nextcloud Server with a computer. Clients using the Nextcloud end-to-end encryption feature download the public and private key via an API endpoint. In versions prior to 3.3.0, the Nextcloud Desktop client fails to check if a private key belongs to previously downloaded public certificate. If the Nextcloud instance serves a malicious public key, the data would be encrypted for this key and thus could be accessible to a malicious actor. This issue is fixed in Nextcloud Desktop Client version 3.3.0. There are no known workarounds aside from upgrading.\n\n- CVE-2021-20327: A specific version of the Node.js mongodb-client-encryption module does not perform correct validation of the KMS server\u2019s certificate. This vulnerability in combination with a privileged network position active MITM attack could result in interception of traffic between the Node.js driver and the KMS service rendering client-side field level encryption (CSFLE) ineffective. This issue was discovered during internal testing and affects mongodb-client-encryption module version 1.2.0, which was available from 2021-Jan-29 and deprecated in the NPM Registry on 2021-Feb-04. This vulnerability does not impact driver traffic payloads with CSFLE-supported key services from applications residing inside the AWS, GCP, and Azure nework fabrics due to compensating controls in these environments. This issue does not impact driver workloads that don\u2019t use Field Level Encryption. This issue affect MongoDB Node.js Driver mongodb-client-encryption module version 1.2.0 \n\n- CVE-2021-20732: The ATOM (ATOM - Smart life App for Android versions prior to 1.8.1 and ATOM - Smart life App for iOS versions prior to 1.8.2) does not verify server certificate properly, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to eavesdrop on encrypted communication via a crafted certificate.\n\n- CVE-2021-20833: The SNKRDUNK Market Place App for iOS versions prior to 2.2.0 does not verify server certificate properly, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to eavesdrop on and/or alter encrypted communication via a crafted certificate.\n\n- CVE-2021-21559: Dell EMC NetWorker, versions 18.x, 19.1.x, 19.2.x 19.3.x, 19.4, and 19.4.0.1 contain an Improper Certificate Validation vulnerability in the client (NetWorker Management Console) components which uses SSL encrypted connection in order to communicate with the application server. An unauthenticated attacker in the same network collision domain as the NetWorker Management Console client could potentially exploit this vulnerability to perform man-in-the-middle attacks to intercept and tamper the traffic between the client and the application server.\n\n- CVE-2021-32727: Nextcloud Android Client is the Android client for Nextcloud. Clients using the Nextcloud end-to-end encryption feature download the public and private key via an API endpoint. In versions prior to 3.16.1, the Nextcloud Android client skipped a step that involved the client checking if a private key belonged to a previously downloaded public certificate. If the Nextcloud instance served a malicious public key, the data would be encrypted for this key and thus could be accessible to a malicious actor. The vulnerability is patched in version 3.16.1. As a workaround, do not add additional end-to-end encrypted devices to a user account.\n\n- CVE-2021-3547: OpenVPN 3 Core Library version 3.6 and 3.6.1 allows a man-in-the-middle attacker to bypass the certificate authentication by issuing an unrelated server certificate using the same hostname found in the verify-x509-name option in a client configuration.\n\n- CVE-2021-20989: Fibaro Home Center 2 and Lite devices with firmware version 4.600 and older initiate SSH connections to the Fibaro cloud to provide remote access and remote support capabilities. This connection can be intercepted using DNS spoofing attack and a device initiated remote port-forward channel can be used to connect to the web management interface.

This flaw allows an attacker to exploit an invalid certificate, resulting in a loss of confidentiality.\n\n- CVE-2022-29482: 'Mobaoku-Auction&Flea Market' App for iOS versions prior to 5.5.16 improperly verifies server certificates, which may allow an attacker to eavesdrop on an encrypted communication via a man-in-the-middle attack.\n\n- CVE-2022-34156: 'Hulu / ????' App for iOS versions prior to 3.0.81 improperly verifies server certificates, which may allow an attacker to eavesdrop on an encrypted communication via a man-in-the-middle attack.\n\n- CVE-2022-45597: ComponentSpace.Saml2 4.4.0 Missing SSL Certificate Validation. NOTE: the vendor does not consider this a vulnerability because the report is only about use of certificates at the application layer (not the transport layer) and \"Certificates are exchanged in a controlled fashion between entities within a trust relationship. This is why self-signed certificates may be used and why validating certificates isn\u2019t as important as doing so for the transport layer certificates.\"\n\n- CVE-2022-29908: The folioupdate service in Fabasoft Cloud Enterprise Client 22.4.0043 allows Local Privilege Escalation.\n\n- CVE-2021-45035: Velneo vClient on its 28.1.3 version, does not correctly check the certificate of authenticity by default. This could allow an attacker that has access to the network to perform a MITM attack in order to obtain the user\u00b4s credentials.\n\n- CVE-2022-25640: In wolfSSL before 5.2.0, a TLS 1.3 server cannot properly enforce a requirement for mutual authentication. A client can simply omit the certificate_verify message from the handshake, and never present a certificate.\n\n- CVE-2022-31083: Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 4.10.11 and 5.2.2, the certificate in the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter not validated. As a result, authentication could potentially be bypassed by making a fake certificate accessible via certain Apple domains and providing the URL to that certificate in an authData object. Versions 4.0.11 and 5.2.2 prevent this by introducing a new `rootCertificateUrl` property to the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter which takes the URL to the root certificate of Apple's Game Center authentication certificate. If no value is set, the `rootCertificateUrl` property defaults to the URL of the current root certificate as of May 27, 2022. Keep in mind that the root certificate can change at any time and that it is the developer's responsibility to keep the root certificate URL up-to-date when using the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter. There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-287 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-287 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-322 (PeerOf)",

Fixed version is 1.4.0) there is a script-cache privilege escalation vulnerability due to kotlin-main-kts cached scripts in the system temp directory, which is shared by all users by default.\n\n- CVE-2021-22118: In Spring Framework, versions 5.2.x prior to 5.2.15 and versions 5.3.x prior to 5.3.7, a WebFlux application is vulnerable to a privilege escalation: by (re)creating the temporary storage directory, a locally authenticated malicious user can read or modify files that have been uploaded to the WebFlux application, or overwrite arbitrary files with multipart request data.\n\n- CVE-2021-21334: In containerd (an industry-standard container runtime) before versions 1.3.10 and 1.4.4, containers launched through containerd's CRI implementation (through Kubernetes, crictl, or any other pod/container client that uses the containerd CRI service) that share the same image may receive incorrect environment variables, including values that are defined for other containers. If the affected containers have different security contexts, this may allow sensitive information to be unintentionally shared. If you are not using containerd's CRI implementation (through one of the mechanisms described above), you are not vulnerable to this issue. If you are not launching multiple containers or Kubernetes pods from the same image which have different environment variables, you are not vulnerable to this issue. If you are not launching multiple containers or Kubernetes pods from the same image in rapid succession, you have reduced likelihood of being vulnerable to this issue This vulnerability has been fixed in containerd 1.3.10 and containerd 1.4.4. Users should update to these versions.\n\n- CVE-2021-22047: In Spring Data REST versions 3.4.0 - 3.4.13, 3.5.0 - 3.5.5, and older unsupported versions, HTTP resources implemented by custom controllers using a configured base API path and a controller type-level request mapping are additionally exposed under URIs that can potentially be exposed for unauthorized access depending on the Spring Security configuration.\n\n- CVE-2021-22550: An attacker can modify the pointers in enclave memory to overwrite arbitrary memory addresses within the secure enclave. It is recommended to update past 0.6.3 or git commit https://github.com/google/asylo/commit/a47ef55db2337d29de19c50cd29b0deb2871d31c\n\n- CVE-2021-38712: OneNav 0.9.12 allows Information Disclosure of the onenav.db3 contents. NOTE: the vendor's recommended solution is to block the access via an NGINX configuration file.\n\n- CVE-2021-40496: SAP Internet Communication framework (ICM) - versions 700, 701, 702, 730, 731, 740, 750, 751, 752, 753, 754, 755, 756, 785, allows an attacker with logon functionality, to exploit the authentication function by using POST and form field to repeat executions of the initial command by a GET request and exposing sensitive data. This vulnerability is normally exposed over the network and successful exploitation can lead to exposure of data like system details.\n\n- CVE-2021-40497: SAP BusinessObjects Analysis (edition for OLAP) - versions 420, 430, allows an attacker to exploit certain application endpoints to read sensitive data. These endpoints are normally exposed over the network and successful exploitation could lead to exposure of some system specific data like its version.\n\n- CVE-2021-22044: In Spring Cloud OpenFeign 3.0.0 to 3.0.4, 2.2.0.RELEASE to 2.2.9.RELEASE, and older unsupported versions, applications using type-level `@RequestMapping`annotations over Feign client interfaces, can be involuntarily exposing endpoints corresponding to `@RequestMapping`-annotated interface methods.\n\n- CVE-2021-24001: A compromised content process could have performed session history manipulations it should not have been able to due to testing infrastructure that was not restricted to testing-only configurations. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 88.\n\n- CVE-2021-34723: A vulnerability in a specific CLI command that is run on Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to overwrite arbitrary files in the configuration database of an affected device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of specific CLI command parameters. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by issuing that command with specific parameters. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite the content of the configuration database and gain root-level access to an affected device.\n\n- CVE-2021-37704: PhpFastCache is a high-performance backend cache system (packagist package phpfastcache/phpfastcache). In versions before 6.1.5, 7.1.2, and 8.0.7 the `phpinfo()` can be exposed if the `/vendor` is not protected from public access. This is a rare situation today since the vendor directory is often located outside the web directory or protected via server rule (.htaccess, etc). Only the v6, v7 and v8 will be patched respectively in 8.0.7, 7.1.2, 6.1.5. Older versions such as v5, v4 are not longer supported and will **NOT** be patched. As a workaround, protect the `/vendor` directory from public access.\n\n- CVE-2020-36319: Insecure configuration of default ObjectMapper in com.vaadin:flow-server versions 3.0.0 through 3.0.5 (Vaadin 15.0.0 through 15.0.4) may expose sensitive data if the application also uses e.g. @RestController\n\n- CVE-2021-28488: Ericsson Network Manager (ENM) before 21.2 has incorrect access-control behavior (that only affects the level of access available to persons who were already granted a highly privileged role).

Affected applications insufficiently limit the access to the internal user authentication service. This could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to trigger several actions on behalf of valid user accounts.\n\n- CVE-2021-4180: An information exposure flaw in openstack-tripleo-heat-templates allows an external user to discover the internal IP or hostname. An attacker could exploit this by checking the www_authenticate_uri parameter (which is visible to all end users) in configuration files. This would give sensitive information which may aid in additional system exploitation. This flaw affects openstack-tripleo-heat-templates versions prior to 11.6.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-0815: Improper access control vulnerability in McAfee WebAdvisor Chrome and Edge browser extensions up to 8.1.0.1895 allows a remote attacker to gain access to McAfee WebAdvisor settings and other details about the user\u2019s system. This could lead to unexpected behaviors including; settings being changed, fingerprinting of the system leading to targeted scams, and not triggering the malicious software if McAfee software is detected.\n\n- CVE-2021-36710: ToaruOS 1.99.2 is affected by incorrect access control via the kernel. Improper MMU management and having a low GDT address allows it to be mapped in userland. A call gate can then be written to escalate to CPL 0.\n\n- CVE-2021-38505: Microsoft introduced a new feature in Windows 10 known as Cloud Clipboard which, if enabled, will record data copied to the clipboard to the cloud, and make it available on other computers in certain scenarios. Applications that wish to prevent copied data from being recorded in Cloud History must use specific clipboard formats; and Firefox before versions 94 and ESR 91.3 did not implement them. This could have caused sensitive data to be recorded to a user's Microsoft account. *This bug only affects Firefox for Windows 10+ with Cloud Clipboard enabled. Other operating systems are unaffected.*. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 94, Thunderbird < 91.3, and Firefox ESR < 91.3.\n\n- CVE-2021-44522: A vulnerability has been identified in SiPass integrated V2.76 (All versions), SiPass integrated V2.80 (All versions), SiPass integrated V2.85 (All versions), Siveillance Identity V1.5 (All versions), Siveillance Identity V1.6 (All versions < V1.6.284.0). Affected applications insufficiently limit the access to the internal message broker system.
