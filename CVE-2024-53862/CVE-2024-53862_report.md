# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-53862

## Description

Argo Workflows is an open source container-native workflow engine for orchestrating parallel jobs on Kubernetes. When using `--auth-mode=client`, Archived Workflows can be retrieved with a fake or spoofed token via the GET Workflow endpoint `/api/v1/workflows/{namespace}/{name}` or when using `--auth-mode=sso`, all Archived Workflows can be retrieved with a valid token via the GET Workflow endpoint `/api/v1/workflows/{namespace}/{name}`. No authentication is performed by the Server itself on `client` tokens. Authentication & authorization is instead delegated to the k8s API server. However, the Workflow Archive does not interact with k8s, and so any token that looks valid will be considered authenticated, even if it is not a k8s token or even if the token has no RBAC for Argo. To handle the lack of pass-through k8s authN/authZ, the Workflow Archive specifically does the equivalent of a `kubectl auth can-i` check for respective methods. In 3.5.7 and 3.5.8, the **auth check was accidentally removed** on the GET Workflow endpoints fallback to archived workflows on these lines, allowing archived workflows to be retrieved with a fake token. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.6.2 and 3.5.13.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Rootcause:** auth check was accidentally removed
- **Impact:** retrieve archived workflows with fake token

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE: The **root cause** is the **missing authentication check**. |
| CWE-862 | Missing Authorization | 0.7 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary Candidate: There may be missing authorization checks for archived workflows after retrieval. |
| CWE-200 | Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Sent Data | 0.5 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate: The impact is the exposure of sensitive workflow data. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is CWE-306, Missing Authentication for Critical Function, because the **auth check was accidentally removed**. CWE-306 is a child of CWE-287 (Improper Authentication). CWE-862, Missing Authorization, is also considered, as there might be a lack of authorization checks after the missing authentication. CWE-200, Exposure of Sensitive Information, is a potential consequence of the missing authentication, where sensitive data is disclosed due to unauthorized access.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authentication check** (CWE-306). This leads to potential missing authorization checks (CWE-862) on archived workflows, ultimately resulting in the exposure of sensitive information (CWE-200). The root cause is the lack of authentication, which then bypasses authorization and leads to information disclosure.

## Summary of Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-306, Missing Authentication for Critical Function. This is supported by the evidence that the **auth check was accidentally removed**, allowing retrieval of archived workflows with a fake token. The retriever results also list CWE-306 as a candidate.

The relationship graph shows that CWE-306 is a child of CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) and can lead to CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) and CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information).

The selection of CWE-306 is at the optimal level of specificity because the vulnerability description clearly indicates the absence of an authentication check, rather than an incorrect authentication or authorization implementation.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
