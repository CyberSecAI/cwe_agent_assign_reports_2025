The root cause is storing credentials in plaintext. |\n| CWE-522 | Insufficiently Protected Credentials | 0.7 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary candidate. Credentials stored without encryption are insufficiently protected. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-312, which directly reflects the **plaintext storage of credentials**. CWE-522 is a broader class that encompasses various ways credentials can be insufficiently protected, including plaintext storage. Therefore, CWE-312 is a more specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    cwe312 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe312 primary\n    class cwe522 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain starts with the **root cause** of **plaintext storage of credentials** (CWE-312). This leads to the impact of information disclosure, where a local attacker can obtain sensitive information. The vulnerability lies in the **insufficient protection of credentials** (CWE-522), but the specific mechanism is the **cleartext storage**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment points to CWE-312 as the primary weakness because the vulnerability description and CVE reference explicitly mention the **plaintext storage of credentials**. The retriever results also list CWE-312 with a high similarity score. CWE-522 is considered as a secondary candidate because it represents the broader issue of insufficiently protected credentials, but CWE-312 provides a more precise description of the vulnerability's root cause.\n\nEvidence from the Vulnerability Description Key Phrases: \"**rootcause:** **plaintext storage of credentials**\"\nEvidence from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary: \"The Texas Instruments Fusion Digital Power Designer v.7.10.1 application stores credentials in plaintext within a configuration file.\"\n\nThe relationship graph shows that CWE-312 is a child of CWE-522, indicating that CWE-312 is a more specific type of insufficiently protected credentials.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-312 directly addresses the **root cause** (plaintext storage), while CWE-522 provides a broader context of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
