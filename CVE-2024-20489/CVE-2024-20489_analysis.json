  "description": "A vulnerability in the storage method of the PON Controller configuration file could allow an authenticated, local attacker with low privileges to obtain the MongoDB credentials. This vulnerability is due to improper storage of the unencrypted database credentials on the device that is running Cisco IOS XR Software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing the configuration files on an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view MongoDB credentials.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2024-20489:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n- The vulnerability stems from the insecure storage of the MongoDB credentials within the PON Controller configuration file. The credentials are stored in cleartext rather than being encrypted.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information:**  The primary vulnerability is the storage of the MongoDB database credentials in an unencrypted format within the configuration file. This exposes the credentials to unauthorized access.\n- **Improper access control:** An authenticated local attacker with low privileges can access the configuration file.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Exposure of Database Credentials:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to obtain the cleartext MongoDB credentials. This would then enable the attacker to gain access to the database and associated information.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Local Access:** The attack requires local access to the device running the affected Cisco IOS XR software.\n- **Configuration File Access:** The attacker needs to be able to access the PON Controller configuration files on the system.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Authenticated Local Access:** The attacker must have valid local user credentials on the system with low privileges\n- **File System Access:** The attacker must have the ability to browse the file system and read the config files.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The vulnerability is present in the Cisco Routed PON Controller Software.\n- The advisory indicates that there are no workarounds to fully remediate this vulnerability, but limiting access to the MongoDB database can be implemented.\n- The document suggests that a fix is included in software releases 24.1 and later and provides an example on how to change the `PonCntlInit.json` file in order to use a keyring instead of storing the password in cleartext.",

CWE-312 \"Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\" is a base CWE and accurately reflects the **improper storage of unencrypted database credentials**. Other considered CWEs like CWE-522 \"Insufficiently Protected Credentials\" are class-level and less specific. CWE-280 was chosen because it is also base-level and an attacker with low privileges was able to access the configuration file.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe280[\"CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n\n    cwe312\n    cwe280 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe312 primary\n    class cwe280 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper storage of unencrypted database credentials** (CWE-312). An attacker with low privileges (CWE-280) gains access to these credentials, leading to exposure of sensitive information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary vulnerability is the storage of MongoDB credentials in cleartext within a configuration file. This directly matches CWE-312 \"Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\". The vulnerability description key phrases state \"**improper storage of unencrypted database credentials**\" which directly supports this. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this by stating \"The primary vulnerability is the storage of the MongoDB database credentials in an unencrypted format within the configuration file.\"\n\nCWE-280 \"Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges\" is considered as a secondary weakness because the attacker requires low privileges to access the configuration file. This is supported by the vulnerability description stating \"An authenticated, local attacker with low privileges to obtain the MongoDB credentials\" and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary which mentions \"An authenticated local attacker with low privileges can access the configuration file.\"\n\nThe retriever results also support CWE-312 as a candidate.\n\nI am confident that CWE-312 is the primary CWE and CWE-280 is a secondary CWE based on the evidence provided. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity as they are base-level CWEs.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.

This hard-coded password is the same for each installation of the product, and it usually cannot be changed or disabled by system administrators without manually modifying the program, or otherwise patching the product. It can also be difficult for the administrator to detect.\n\n  - Outbound: the product connects to another system or component, and it contains hard-coded credentials for connecting to that component. This variant applies to front-end systems that authenticate with a back-end service. The back-end service may require a fixed password that can be easily discovered. The programmer may simply hard-code those back-end credentials into the front-end product.\n\n",
