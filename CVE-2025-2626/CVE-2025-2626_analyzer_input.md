## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The content relates to CVE-2025-2626.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The 49 line of the edit\_case.php file uses the PHP method to retrieve user input from the GET element. Then, the value of this element is passed to the code without proper cleaning or validation, and ultimately used for database queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
SQL injection

**Impact of exploitation:**
Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to gain database privileges, which can result in a large amount of data in the database. If the other party's database has DBA privileges, it may lead to server host privileges being obtained.

**Attack vectors:**
The "id" parameter in the "edit\_case.php" file is vulnerable.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be able to craft malicious SQL queries and send them through the "id" GET parameter.

**Mitigation or fix:**
The content does not provide a specific fix, but implies the need for proper cleaning or validation of user input before using it in database queries.

**Payload examples:**
- time-based blind injection: `id=1' AND (SELECT 5343 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))Cpga) AND 'drPq'='drPq`
- UNION query: `id=-9094' UNION ALL SELECT CONCAT(0x716a7a7671,0x456d6e516849716d636e6e786f666674756246584b76714f594d5243715053506e6e657042736378,0x7178787171),NULL,NULL-- -`
