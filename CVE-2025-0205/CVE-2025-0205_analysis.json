Specifically, the `$id` parameter obtained from the GET request is directly inserted into an SQL query without any validation or sanitization.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- SQL Injection vulnerability due to unsanitized user-controlled input (`$id` parameter).\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- Unauthorized access to the database.\n- Potential for Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server.\n- Data exfiltration, modification, or deletion.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- The attacker can manipulate the `id` parameter in the URL of `details2.php` to inject malicious SQL queries.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable `details2.php` endpoint.\n- No prior authentication is explicitly required.",
