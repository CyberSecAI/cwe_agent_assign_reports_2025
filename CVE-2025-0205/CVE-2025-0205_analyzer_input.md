## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content is related to CVE-2025-0205.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized access to the database.
- Potential for Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server.
- Data exfiltration, modification, or deletion.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker can manipulate the `id` parameter in the URL of `details2.php` to inject malicious SQL queries.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
