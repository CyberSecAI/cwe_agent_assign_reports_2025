# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-6333

## Vulnerability Description
Authenticated Remote Code Execution in Altalink, Versalink & WorkCentre Products.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** Remote Code Execution
- **attacker:** Authenticated
- **product:** Altalink and Versalink and WorkCentre Products

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2024-6333:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Insufficient input validation in the "Network Troubleshooting" menu of Xerox printers' web interface. Specifically, the IPv4 address field within the tcpdump configuration lacks proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** Attackers can inject operating system commands into the `tcpdump` command string by manipulating the IPv4 address field.
- **Authenticated RCE:** The vulnerability allows for Remote Code Execution (RCE).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Full System Compromise:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the printer's operating system with root privileges. This leads to complete control over the printer, potentially enabling attackers to steal data, disrupt operations, or use the printer as a foothold for further network attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The attack is launched through the web interface of the affected Xerox printers.
- **Network Troubleshooting:** Exploitation leverages the "Network Troubleshooting" feature, specifically the ability to configure tcpdump filters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Administrative Access:** The attacker must be authenticated as a user with administrative access to the printer's web interface.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware of the command injection vulnerability in the IPv4 address field.

**Additional Notes:**
- The advisory mentions that the character filter can be bypassed, and other payloads without the need for a command file in `/tmp/~cmd` exist.
- It also notes that an attacker may leverage a previously patched unauthenticated RCE (XRX23-020) to plant command execution payloads on vulnerable devices before exploiting this vulnerability.
- Affected products include:  AltaLink, VersaLink, WorkCentre, and EC80xx series printers, with specific vulnerable versions listed in the advisory.
