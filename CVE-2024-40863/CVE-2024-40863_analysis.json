The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that a **weakness/vulnerability present** allows an app to potentially leak sensitive user information, with the **impact of exploitation** being an attacker gaining access to sensitive user data.\n\nBased on this information, the most appropriate CWE is CWE-922 [CWE-922: Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information]. This is because the vulnerability allows an app to leak sensitive user information, indicating that the information is not being stored securely.\n\nThe retriever results also suggest CWE-497 [CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere]. This CWE is related, as it involves the exposure of sensitive system-level information to unauthorized actors. While CWE-922 [CWE-922: Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information] is the primary issue, CWE-497 [CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere] could be a secondary contributing factor.\n\nCWE-285 [CWE-285: Improper Authorization] was considered since it's related to security vulnerabilities, but it's not directly applicable here as the issue is related to data storage rather than authorization. Similarly, CWE-787 [CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write], CWE-665 [CWE-665: Improper Initialization], CWE-843 [CWE-843: Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')], CWE-20 [CWE-20: Improper Input Validation], CWE-415 [CWE-415: Double Free], and CWE-757 [CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation ('Algorithm Downgrade')] are less relevant because they focus on memory corruption, input validation, and algorithm negotiation, which are not the primary issues described in the vulnerability.\n\nThe selection of CWE-922 [CWE-922: Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information] is at the optimal level of specificity because the vulnerability description specifically mentions the leakage of sensitive user information, indicating that the information is not being stored securely. While a more specific child CWE of CWE-922 [CWE-922: Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information] might exist, there is not enough information provided to determine which one would be the most appropriate.",
