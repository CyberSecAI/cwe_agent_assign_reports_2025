This likely allows a remote attacker to access the BMC.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have network access to the BMC during the period when it is connected to a network but before its admin password is changed.",

Because of this, an attacker can gain administrative access to the BMC, potentially bypassing authentication (**CWE-306**).\nCWE-1393 -> CWE-306\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is the use of a **default password** in the OpenBMC firmware. This allows an attacker with network access to gain unauthorized administrative access. The evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE Reference Links Content Summary strongly supports this.\n\nThe **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases** include:\n- **rootcause:** **default password**\n- **weakness:** **default password and session management**\n\nThe **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** includes:\n- The primary vulnerability is the existence of a **default \"admin\" account without a pre-set password** in the BMC firmware.\n\nCWE-1393 **Use of Default Password** is the most accurate representation of the **root cause**. It is a **Base** level CWE, which is preferred. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions the **default password** as a key weakness.\nCWE-306 **Missing Authentication for Critical Function** is considered a secondary candidate because the existence of the **default password** effectively bypasses the authentication process.\n\nCWE-287 **Improper Authentication** was considered but not used because it is a **Class** level CWE and less specific than **CWE-1393**.\nCWE-798 **Use of Hard-coded Credentials** was considered but not used, because a **default password** is provided which the user is supposed to change. A **hard-coded credential** is not intended to be changed.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a
