The product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE selected is CWE-862, which is a Class-level CWE. Although it is generally preferred to select a Base or Variant level CWE, in this case, the description precisely matches the definition of CWE-862. The vulnerability description clearly states a **missing capability check**, which directly aligns with the concept of missing authorization. The retriever results also listed this as the top candidate. CWE-862 has child CWEs, such as CWE-285 (Improper Authorization), but those are not a fit.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe425[\"CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\"]\n\n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe862\n    cwe425 -->|CHILDOF| cwe862\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe285,cwe425 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **missing capability check** (CWE-862), leading to unauthorized access and the ability to export all avia settings, which include sensitive information.\n  - **Root Cause:** CWE-862 Missing Authorization\n  - **Impact:** Export of sensitive information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, specifically the vulnerability description stating a **missing capability check**. The retriever results support this by listing CWE-862 as the top candidate. The relationship analysis confirmed that CWE-862 is the most appropriate level of specificity, even though it is a Class-level CWE.\n\nThe vulnerability description clearly points to a **missing authorization** check, allowing unauthenticated attackers to export sensitive data. This perfectly aligns with the definition of CWE-862.\n\nOther CWEs Considered and Rejected:\n\n*   CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function): While authentication is related to authorization, the description explicitly mentions a **missing capability check**, indicating an authorization issue rather than a complete lack of authentication.\n*   CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key): This CWE is about bypassing authorization using a user-controlled key, which is not mentioned in the vulnerability description.\n*   CWE-425 (Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')): This CWE involves direct requests to restricted URLs without proper authorization. While it is related to missing authorization, the description does not specifically mention direct requests or forced browsing.\n*   CWE-352 (Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)): This is not relevant as it is about exploiting trust between a user and a website, and requires a forged request.\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as
