  "description": "WeGIA is an open source Web Manager for Institutions with a focus on Portuguese language users. A **Path Traversal vulnerability** was discovered in the WeGIA application, `exportar_dump.php` endpoint. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information stored in `config.php`. `config.php` contains information that could allow direct access to the database. This issue has been addressed in version 3.2.14 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",

It provides a detailed security advisory regarding a path traversal vulnerability in the WeGIA application. The information provided goes into more detail than the placeholder CVE description.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the extracted information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nImproper validation of the `file` parameter in the `exportar_dump.php` endpoint.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Path Traversal (CWE-22, CWE-284)\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   Unauthorized access to sensitive information, specifically the `config.php` file.\n*   Potential theft of database login credentials.\n*   Information disclosure (e.g., `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/hosts`, `/etc/os-release`, `win.ini`, SSH private keys).\n*   Potential for chain attacks leveraging the disclosed information.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Network-based exploitation via a POST request to `/html/configuracao/exportar_dump.php`.\n*   The `file` parameter is used to traverse the file system.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   No authentication required. The vulnerability can be exploited even without being logged in due to a flaw in session validation and code execution termination.\n*   Network access to the vulnerable endpoint.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   Upgrade to version 3.2.14 or later.\n\n**PoC (Proof of Concept):**\n\n```\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:8080/html/configuracao/exportar_dump.php --data \"file=../../../../../../../../../../../../../../var/www/html/config.php\"\n```\n\n**CVSS Score:**\n\n*   CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:H/SI:H/SA:H (Critical Severity)",

The impact of this vulnerability is the exposure of sensitive information, making CWE-200 a relevant secondary CWE. CWE-22 is a Base level CWE, while CWE-200 is a Class level CWE. We choose the base level for the root cause, and a class level for the impact.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information\"]\n    \n    cwe200 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe22\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe22 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with:\n1.  **Root Cause:** CWE-22 - Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') due to **improper validation of the `file` parameter**.\n2.  **Impact:** CWE-200 - Exposure of Sensitive Information, specifically the `config.php` file containing database credentials.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified a **path traversal vulnerability** in the WeGIA application. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the **root cause** is the **improper validation** of the `file` parameter in the `exportar_dump.php` endpoint, leading to CWE-22. The impact is unauthorized access to sensitive information, specifically the `config.php` file, which aligns with CWE-200.\n\nThe retriever results also highlight CWE-22 as the top match, further supporting this classification. The relationship analysis shows how CWE-22 can lead to information exposure (CWE-200), confirming the vulnerability chain.\n\nThe selection of CWE-22 is based on the evidence of a path traversal vulnerability due to **improper input validation**. The selection of CWE-200 is based on the impact of the vulnerability, which is the exposure of sensitive information.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n*   **CWE-22:** Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal'). The product uses external input to construct a pathname, but it does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.\n\n*   **CWE-200:** Exposure of Sensitive Information. The software exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have that information.\n\nHere's why other CWEs were not selected or were considered less suitable:\n\n*   CWE-23 (Relative Path Traversal): While related to path traversal, CWE-22 is a broader category that includes relative path traversal, making it a more suitable primary classification.\n*   CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key): The vulnerability doesn't primarily involve bypassing authorization through a user-controlled key.\n*   CWE-209 (Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information): The primary issue is not the generation of error messages with sensitive information, but the exposure of sensitive information due to path traversal.\n*   CWE-434 (Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type): This CWE is not relevant as the vulnerability does not involve unrestricted file uploads.\n*   CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function): While the attacker doesn't need to be authenticated, the primary weakness is the path traversal, not the missing authentication.\n*   CWE-94 (Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')): This is not code injection.",
