## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-26616 Content

This content **IS RELATED** to CVE-2025-26616. It provides a detailed security advisory regarding a path traversal vulnerability in the WeGIA application. The information provided goes into more detail than the placeholder CVE description.

Here's a breakdown of the extracted information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

Improper validation of the `file` parameter in the `exportar_dump.php` endpoint.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Path Traversal (CWE-22, CWE-284)

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Unauthorized access to sensitive information, specifically the `config.php` file.
*   Potential theft of database login credentials.
*   Information disclosure (e.g., `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/hosts`, `/etc/os-release`, `win.ini`, SSH private keys).
*   Potential for chain attacks leveraging the disclosed information.

**Attack vectors:**

*   Network-based exploitation via a POST request to `/html/configuracao/exportar_dump.php`.
*   The `file` parameter is used to traverse the file system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   No authentication required. The vulnerability can be exploited even without being logged in due to a flaw in session validation and code execution termination.
*   Network access to the vulnerable endpoint.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   Upgrade to version 3.2.14 or later.

**PoC (Proof of Concept):**

```
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/html/configuracao/exportar_dump.php --data "file=../../../../../../../../../../../../../../var/www/html/config.php"
```

**CVSS Score:**

*   CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:H/SI:H/SA:H (Critical Severity)
