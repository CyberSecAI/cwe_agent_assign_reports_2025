  "description": "A vulnerability was found in StarSea99 starsea-mall 1.0. It has been declared as critical. This vulnerability affects the function UploadController of the file src/main/java/com/siro/mall/controller/common/uploadController.java. The manipulation of the argument file leads to **unrestricted upload**. The attack can be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.",

  "reference_content": "## CVE-2025-0399 Analysis\n\nThe provided content is **RELEVANT** to a potential vulnerability. Here's an extraction of the information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe upload method in `src/main/java/com/siro/mall/controller/common/uploadController.java` does not restrict the types of files that can be uploaded.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Unrestricted file upload.\n*   Lack of input validation on uploaded files.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nAttackers can upload arbitrary files, specifically JSP and HTML files, potentially leading to remote code execution or other malicious activities.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Uploading a malicious JSP file that, when accessed, executes arbitrary code on the server.\n*   Uploading a malicious HTML file that could lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   An attacker needs to be able to access the upload functionality of the application.\n*   No authentication appears to be required to upload files.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   Implement strict file type validation on the server-side. Only allow uploads of expected and safe file types.\n*   Sanitize uploaded file names and content to prevent malicious code injection.\n*   Consider storing uploaded files outside of the webroot to prevent direct execution.\n*   Implement a content security policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS risks.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\nThe content includes a sample HTTP POST request demonstrating the upload of a JSP file. The provided JSP code snippet `<% out.println(\"test\"); %>` confirms the ability to execute server-side code. The issue report also provides example URLs and login credentials for testing, which should be treated with caution.\n\nThe content provides more detail than a typical CVE description, including a proof-of-concept (the HTTP request and JSP code).",

Several other CWEs were considered, but ultimately deemed secondary. CWE-497 and CWE-472 are included as secondary issues because the unrestricted file upload can lead to sensitive information exposure and external control. The abstraction levels of the selected CWEs are all Base, providing the most specific representation of the weaknesses.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe434[\"CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\"]\n    cwe497[\"CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\"]\n    cwe472[\"CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\"]\n    \n    cwe497 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe434\n    cwe472 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe434\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe434 primary\n    class cwe497,cwe472 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **unrestricted upload** (CWE-434), which then can lead to exposure of sensitive information (CWE-497) and external control (CWE-472).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is clearly the **unrestricted upload** functionality, which directly aligns with CWE-434. This assessment is based on the provided vulnerability description and the CVE reference link analysis, both of which emphasize the lack of file type validation. The secondary CWEs highlight potential consequences of this initial weakness.\n\nThe graph relationships show how the primary weakness (CWE-434) can lead to the secondary weaknesses.
