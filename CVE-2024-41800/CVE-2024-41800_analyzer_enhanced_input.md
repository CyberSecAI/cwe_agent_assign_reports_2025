## Vulnerability Description
Craft is a content management system (CMS). Craft CMS 5 allows **reuse of TOTP tokens multiple times** within the validity period. An attacker is able to re-submit a valid TOTP token to establish an authenticated session. This requires that the attacker has knowledge of the victims credentials. This has been patched in Craft 5.2.3.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **reuse of TOTP tokens multiple times**
- **impact:** establish authenticated session
- **vector:** re-submit valid TOTP token
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** Craft CMS
- **version:** 5

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper implementation of Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) authentication within Craft CMS. Specifically, the system failed to invalidate a TOTP token after its initial successful use, allowing for reuse within the validity period.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **TOTP Reuse:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to reuse a TOTP token multiple times for authentication, violating the one-time-use principle of TOTP.
- **Missing timestamp validation:** The system did not track when a TOTP was last used.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker who has obtained a valid TOTP token, along with the victim's credentials, can reuse the token within its validity period to gain unauthorized access to the victim's account. This allows session hijacking even if a valid token was used in an earlier session.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based.
- An attacker needs the victim's credentials and a valid TOTP token generated for their account, within its validity window.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have prior knowledge of a valid user's credentials (username/password).
- The attacker needs to obtain a valid TOTP token (either by observing the victim's entry, or through other means).
- The attacker needs to make the authentication attempt within the token's validity window which, in this case, is 2 minutes, according to the advisory.
- The attacker needs to send the TOTP token to the `/index.php?p=admin%2Factions%2Fauth%2Fverify-totp` endpoint.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is present in Craft CMS versions 5.0.0-beta.1 through 5.2.2.
- The issue has been fixed in version 5.2.3 by using the `verifyKeyNewer` function of the used Google2FA library which ensures that the token is only used once.
- The fix involved storing a timestamp indicating the last time a TOTP was used, and comparing subsequent attempts with this timestamp.
- The validity period of a TOTP token is 2 minutes, increasing the likelihood of a successful brute-force attack given multiple valid tokens.
- The CVSS score is 4.8 (Medium) with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N
