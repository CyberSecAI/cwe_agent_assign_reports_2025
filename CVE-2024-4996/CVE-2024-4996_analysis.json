  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-4996:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability stems from the use of hard-coded credentials within the Wapro ERP Desktop software. Specifically, a fixed password is used for a special database account across all installations of the software.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials:** The primary weakness is the presence of a hard-coded password for a database account. This is a significant security flaw as it provides a known access method for unauthorized users.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Data Breach:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain access to sensitive information stored in the database. Because the password is the same for all installations, a compromise on one system could enable an attacker to target other systems.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- The attack vector involves an attacker using the hard-coded password to gain access to the database. \n- The attacker would need to have network access to the database server or the ability to access it directly if the database is stored locally on the targeted machine.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- The attacker needs to know the hard-coded password, which, by the nature of the vulnerability, is static and available to anyone with this knowledge.\n- The attacker must have network connectivity to the database server or local access if the database is stored locally on the targeted machine.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n- The vulnerability affects all versions of Wapro ERP Desktop software up to 8.90.0.\n- The vulnerability was reported to CERT Polska, who coordinated the disclosure process.",
