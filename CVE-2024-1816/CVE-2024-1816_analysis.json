  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n\n*   The vulnerability stems from a poorly written regular expression (regex) used in `lib/gitlab/file_detector.rb` to identify specific file types, specifically OpenAPI/Swagger files.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n\n*   **Catastrophic Backtracking:** The regex `/[^/]*(openapi|swagger)[^/]*\\.(yaml|yml|json)\\z/` is vulnerable to catastrophic backtracking. This occurs when the regex engine tries numerous combinations of matches and backtracking, leading to excessive resource consumption and slow processing.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By crafting a malicious filename that triggers catastrophic backtracking, an attacker can make the GitLab server unresponsive.\n*   **Exhaustive Resource Consumption:** The attack causes high CPU usage, potentially impacting the performance of the entire GitLab instance.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Malicious Filenames:** The primary attack vector involves creating files with specific filenames designed to exploit the vulnerable regex.\n*   **GraphQL Queries:**  The attacker triggers the regex evaluation by making GraphQL queries that request information about files with malicious names.\n*   **Public Projects:** The attacker can potentially exploit this vulnerability without authentication on publicly accessible projects.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **GitLab User:** The attacker needs to be a GitLab user to create the malicious file within a project.\n*   **Project Access:** The attacker needs to have access to a project where they can create a file with a malicious filename. This could be a public project.\n*   **Ability to Send GraphQL Queries:** The attacker needs to be able to send GraphQL queries to the GitLab instance, as this is how the regex is triggered.",

CWE-1333 is a specific type of inefficient algorithmic complexity, focusing specifically on regular expressions. The vulnerability description clearly points to a poorly written regular expression as the root cause, making CWE-1333 the more specific and appropriate choice. CWE-400 represents the impact of the inefficient regex.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1333[\"CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe407[\"CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity\"]\n\n    cwe1333 -->|CHILDOF| cwe407\n    cwe1333 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe400\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1333 primary\n    class cwe400 secondary\n    class cwe407 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **inefficient regular expression (CWE-1333)** in the `lib/gitlab/file_detector.rb` file. This **weakness** leads to catastrophic backtracking when processing specially crafted filenames. The excessive computation consumes significant CPU resources, resulting in **uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400)** and ultimately causing a denial-of-service condition.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis strongly supports the selection of CWE-1333 as the primary CWE. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions a \"poorly written regular expression\" susceptible to \"catastrophic backtracking,\" which aligns perfectly with CWE-1333's definition.\nThe \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section highlights the root cause: \"The vulnerability stems from a poorly written regular expression (regex) used in `lib/gitlab/file_detector.rb`... vulnerable to catastrophic backtracking.\"\nThe retriever results also identify CWE-1333 as a relevant candidate.\n\nCWE-400 is included as a secondary CWE because it represents the direct consequence of the inefficient regex, as the excessive CPU consumption leads to a denial-of-service condition.\n\nThe choice of CWE-1333 is at the optimal level of specificity. While CWE-407 (Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity) is a parent of CWE-1333, the vulnerability specifically involves regular expressions, making CWE-1333 the more accurate and detailed classification.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1286: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input that is expected to be well-formed - i.e., to comply with a certain syntax - but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input complies with the syntax.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-88: Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs a string for a command to be executed by a separate component\nin another control sphere, but it does not properly delimit the\nintended arguments, options, or switches within that command string.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a regular expression with an inefficient, possibly exponential worst-case computational complexity that consumes excessive CPU cycles.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-285: Improper Authorization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-285 is high-level and lower-level CWEs can frequently be used instead.
