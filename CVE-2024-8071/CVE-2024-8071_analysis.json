This aligns directly with **CWE-266 - Incorrect Privilege Assignment**. The description states that the system **fails to restrict**, which is the root cause. The impact is that a user can become a System Admin. The retriever results also list CWE-266 with a good score.\n\nCWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) was considered, as authorization is related to privilege management.
