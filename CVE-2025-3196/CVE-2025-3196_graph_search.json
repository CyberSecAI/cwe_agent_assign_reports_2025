Affected is the function AssimpMD2ImporterInternReadFile in the library code/AssetLib/MD2/MD2Loader.cpp of the component Malformed File Handler. The manipulation of the argument Name leads to stack-based buffer overflow. The attack needs to be approached locally. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component. Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-121 CWE-119 CWE-79 CWE-126 CWE-89 CWE-190 CWE-125 CWE-122",
