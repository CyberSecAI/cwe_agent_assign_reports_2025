## Vulnerability Description
Retrieval-based-Voice-Conversion-WebUI is a voice changing framework based on VITS. Versions 2.2.231006 and prior are vulnerable to **command injection**. The variables exp_dir1, np7, trainset_dir4 and sr2 take user input and pass it to the preprocess_dataset function, which concatenates them into a command that is run on the server. This can lead to arbitrary command execution. As of time of publication, no known patches exist.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **command injection**
- **impact:** arbitrary command execution
- **product:** Retrieval-based-Voice-Conversion-WebUI
- **version:** 2.2.231006 and prior
