  "description": "Outline is an open source, collaborative document editor. A **type confusion issue** was found in ProseMirrors rendering process that leads to a Stored **Cross-Site Scripting** (XSS) vulnerability in Outline. An authenticated user can create a document containing a malicious JavaScript payload. When other users view this document, the malicious Javascript can execute in the origin of Outline. Outline includes CSP rules to prevent third-party code execution, however in the case of self-hosting and having your file storage on the same domain as Outline a malicious payload can be uploaded as a file attachment and bypass those CSP restrictions. This issue has been addressed in release version 0.77.3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",

  "reference_content": "- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A type confusion issue in ProseMirror's rendering process.\n- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-843: Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes)\n- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into a document. When other users view this document, the injected JavaScript can execute within the context of the Outline application. This could lead to unauthorized actions, data theft, or other malicious activities. Additionally, if the file storage is on the same domain as Outline, a malicious payload can be uploaded as a file attachment and bypass CSP restrictions, increasing the attack surface.\n- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack. The attacker creates a malicious document using the Outline editor. When other users view the document, the vulnerability is triggered. If self-hosted, the file storage being on the same domain allows for malicious file attachments bypassing CSP restrictions.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user capable of creating documents in Outline. The attacker does not need to be local to the system.\n\nThe provided content gives more details than the official CVE description by including specific details about the type confusion in the rendering process, the bypass of CSP restrictions via file attachments, and a link to a blog post that explains the vulnerability in more detail.",

This payload isn't properly neutralized, resulting in a **Cross-Site Scripting** (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79). Furthermore, the ability to upload files (CWE-434) allows bypassing CSP restrictions, escalating the impact.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-79 because it directly addresses the **weakness** of **Cross-Site Scripting**. The root cause, **type confusion**, is best represented by CWE-843. The bypass of CSP restrictions via file uploads is captured by CWE-434.\n\nThe vulnerability description clearly states the **type confusion** issue and the resulting Stored **Cross-Site Scripting** vulnerability.
