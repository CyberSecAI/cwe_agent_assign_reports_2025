  "description": "Discourse is an open-source discussion platform. Prior to version 3.2.3 on the `stable` branch and version 3.3.0.beta4 on the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches, moderators using the review queue to review users may see a users email address even when the Allow moderators to view email addresses setting is disabled. This issue is patched in version 3.2.3 on the `stable` branch and version 3.3.0.beta4 on the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches. As possible workarounds, either prevent moderators from accessing the review queue or disable the approve suspect users site setting and the must approve users site setting to prevent users from being added to the review queue.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-36122:\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe vulnerability stems from the `ReviewableUserSerializer` in Discourse not properly checking user scopes when including email addresses in the payload. Specifically, it fails to prevent moderators from viewing user email addresses in the review queue when the \"Allow moderators to view email addresses\" setting is disabled.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability exposes user email addresses to moderators who should not have access, violating the intended access control settings.\n- **Inadequate Scope Check:** The `ReviewableUserSerializer` does not correctly enforce permission checks based on the current user's scope in the context of the review queue. It was including the email regardless of the `moderators_view_emails` setting if the user was in a reviewable state.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- Unauthorized access to user email addresses by moderators. This could potentially lead to privacy violations.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- The attack vector is via the network (web application interface).\n- A moderator can access the review queue to view user data.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- The attacker must be a moderator within a Discourse instance.\n- The \"Allow moderators to view email addresses\" site setting must be disabled.\n- Users must be placed into the review queue (e.g. by the \"must approve users\" setting).\n- The attacker needs to access the review queue in order to view user data.\n\n**Additional details from the provided content:**\n- The vulnerability is present in Discourse versions `stable <= 3.2.2`, `beta <= 3.3.0.beta3`, and `tests-passed <= 3.3.0.beta3`.\n- Patched versions are `stable >= 3.2.3`, `beta >= 3.3.0.beta4`, and `tests-passed >= 3.3.0.beta4`.\n- The fix involves modifying the `ReviewableUserSerializer` to exclude email addresses based on user scope. A new method `include_email?` was added to check if the current scope has the ability to check emails, removing the email from the payload if not. This check is performed within the serializer's `attributes` method.\n\n**CVSS Score:**\n- CVSS v3 base score is 2.4/10, classified as Low severity.\n- CVSS vector string is `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N`\n\nIn summary, this vulnerability is an information disclosure issue where moderators are able to see user emails under specific conditions even if they should not be able to. The fix ensures that the email is only included when the moderator is allowed to view emails.",

  "analysis": "# Summary\n| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| CWE-201 | Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data | 0.9 | Base | Primary CWE | Allowed |\n| CWE-863 | Incorrect Authorization | 0.6 | Class | Secondary Candidate | Allowed-with-Review |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-201, which directly addresses the **insertion of sensitive information**. While CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) is considered, it's a class-level CWE and less specific than CWE-201. There isn't a strong \"chain\" relationship, as the vulnerability primarily involves the **failure** to prevent the inclusion of email addresses, rather than a sequence of actions. The abstraction levels were considered, favoring the base-level CWE-201 for its specific nature.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe201 -->|CANALSOBE| cwe863\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe201 primary\n    class cwe863 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is as follows:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Improper** handling of user scopes within the `ReviewableUserSerializer`, leading to the **unintentional** inclusion of sensitive email information.\n2.  **Weakness:** The system **fails** to properly check and enforce permissions, leading to the **exposure** of sensitive information.\n3.  **Impact:** Moderators can view user email addresses even when the \"Allow moderators to view email addresses\" setting is disabled.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is primarily based on the provided vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary. The evidence clearly points to an **information disclosure** issue, where user email addresses are being exposed to unauthorized moderators. The `ReviewableUserSerializer` is **incorrectly** including email addresses in the payload, **failing** to respect the configured permissions.\n\nThe retriever results also support this conclusion, with CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data) being a top candidate. The graph relationships show a potential connection to authorization issues, but the primary problem lies in the **unintentional** transmission of sensitive data. The selection of CWE-201 is optimal because it specifically addresses the type of information being disclosed (email addresses) and the mechanism by which it is being disclosed (sent data). While CWE-863 is a valid secondary concern, the root cause is the **insertion of sensitive information**, not necessarily a flawed authorization process *per se*. The fix implemented in the patched versions directly targets the serializer's behavior, preventing the inclusion of email addresses when the moderator lacks the necessary permissions. This reinforces the selection of CWE-201 as the primary weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-359: Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent a person's private, personal information from being accessed by actors who either (1) are not explicitly authorized to access the information or (2) do not have the implicit consent of the person about whom the information is collected.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-610: Externally Controlled Reference to a Resource in Another Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an externally controlled name or reference that resolves to a resource that is outside of the intended control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
