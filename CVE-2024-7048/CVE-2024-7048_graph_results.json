  "query": "In version v0.3.8 of open-webui, an improper privilege management vulnerability exists in the API endpoints GET /api/v1/documents/ and POST /rag/api/v1/doc. This vulnerability allows a lower-privileged user to access and overwrite files managed by a higher-privileged admin. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can view metadata of files uploaded by an admin and overwrite these files, compromising the integrity and availability of the RAG models.",
