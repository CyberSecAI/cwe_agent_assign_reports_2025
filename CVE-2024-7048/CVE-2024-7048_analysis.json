  "description": "In version v0.3.8 of open-webui, an **improper privilege management** vulnerability exists in the API endpoints GET /api/v1/documents/ and POST /rag/api/v1/doc. This vulnerability allows a lower-privileged user to access and overwrite files managed by a higher-privileged admin. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can view metadata of files uploaded by an admin and overwrite these files, compromising the integrity and availability of the RAG models.",

While CWE-269 is a Class-level CWE and generally discouraged, in this specific case, the description focuses on the broad concept of privilege management rather than a specific authorization or permission issue. Secondary CWEs like CWE-863 and CWE-668 are considered because they represent potential ways in which **improper privilege management** can manifest.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe269[\"CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    \n    cwe863 -->|PEEROF| cwe269\n    cwe668 -->|PEEROF| cwe269\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe269 primary\n    class cwe863,cwe668 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper privilege management** (CWE-269), allowing a low-privileged user to access resources managed by a higher-privileged admin. This leads to the ability to view metadata and overwrite files, compromising integrity and availability.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability, which the description explicitly states as **improper privilege management**. The retriever results also highlighted CWE-269, although it is generally discouraged. Given the direct statement in the description, CWE-269 is selected as the primary CWE with a confidence score of 0.8. This assessment is heavily based on the explicit statement of the root cause.\n\nCWE-863 and CWE-668 are considered as secondary CWEs because the vulnerability leads to an **incorrect authorization** (CWE-863) where the lower-privileged user is authorized to perform actions they shouldn't be allowed to do. Additionally, it leads to **Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere** (CWE-668) because files managed by an admin are accessible to a lower-privileged user.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the Class level of specificity because the provided evidence doesn't allow us to pinpoint the exact flaw. If we had more information such as the exact line of code with the flaw, we may be able to specify a Base or Variant CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 1396.35\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly assign, modify, track, or check privileges for an actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-269 is commonly misused. It can be conflated with \"privilege escalation,\" which is a technical impact that is listed in many low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is not useful for trend analysis.\n\n## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 1427.62\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.",
