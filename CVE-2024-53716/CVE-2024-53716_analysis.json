The secondary weakness is CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting'), a base weakness because the product doesn't neutralize user-controllable input before placing it in a web page served to other users. CWE-352 can lead to other vulnerabilities like XSS.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    \n    cwe352 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe79\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe352 primary\n    class cwe79 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the **lack of CSRF protection** (CWE-352). This allows an attacker to trick a user into performing actions they did not intend, leading to **Stored XSS** (CWE-79) because the malicious input isn't properly neutralized before being displayed to other users.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis indicates that the primary vulnerability is CWE-352, due to the **lack of CSRF protection**. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web application, resulting in stored XSS (CWE-79). The evidence provided clearly supports this classification, and the retriever results align with this assessment.\n\nThe vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"**Cross-Site Request Forgery** (CSRF) vulnerability\" and \"**Stored XSS**\". The ROOTCAUSE is identified as \"**lack of CSRF protection**\". This directly maps to CWE-352. The resulting **XSS** maps to CWE-79 because the application does not neutralize user-controllable input.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately represent the root cause (CWE-352) and the resulting impact (CWE-79) of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n- CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n- CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')",
