## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content details three distinct vulnerabilities discovered in the IrfanView image viewer, specifically within the `Exr.dll` plugin. All three vulnerabilities are related to access violations that occur during the processing of crafted EXR image files. Here's a breakdown of each:

**Vulnerability 1**

*   **Root Cause:** An access violation occurs during the execution of `EXR!ReadEXR+0x40ef1` while processing a specific EXR file. The crash occurs due to an invalid memory write operation.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The vulnerability is located at `EXR!ReadEXR+0x40ef1`, specifically a `mov word ptr [r9],ax` instruction. The register `r9` contains an invalid memory address.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** The exploitation leads to a crash of the IrfanView application, which results in a denial of service.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Opening a specially crafted EXR file (named `0001.exr`) with IrfanView version 4.67.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious EXR file to the victim.

**Vulnerability 2**

*   **Root Cause:**  An access violation occurs when executing `EXR!ReadEXR+0x4eef0` while processing another crafted EXR file. The root cause is an invalid memory write during image processing, specifically a non-temporal store instruction.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The vulnerability is at `EXR!ReadEXR+0x4eef0`, specifically the instruction `movntdq xmmword ptr [rcx],xmm0`. The register `rcx` points to an invalid memory location.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Similar to the first vulnerability, this results in a denial of service by crashing the application.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Opening the malicious `0002.exr` file with IrfanView version 4.67.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to provide a malicious EXR file to the victim.

**Vulnerability 3**

*   **Root Cause:** An access violation at `EXR!ReadEXR+0x3df50` during the processing of another specially crafted EXR file, triggered by an invalid write operation to memory.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The vulnerability is at `EXR!ReadEXR+0x3df50`, specifically a `mov word ptr [rdi],ax` instruction. The address contained in `rdi` is an invalid write target.
*    **Impact of Exploitation:** Leads to a denial-of-service condition due to the crash.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Opening the malicious `0003.exr` file with IrfanView version 4.67.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious EXR file to the victim.

**Additional Details**

*   **Affected Plugin:**  All three vulnerabilities are located within the `Exr.dll` plugin, version 4.67.1.0.
*   **Affected Version:** IrfanView version 4.67 is specified as being vulnerable in all three cases.
*   **Commonality:** All three vulnerabilities are triggered by loading maliciously crafted `.exr` files and result in an access violation leading to a crash.

The content provides specific crash details including the register values and the exact instruction causing the exception, which is more detail than a typical CVE description would provide.
