## Vulnerability Description
The Minify HTML plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in all versions up to, and including, 2.1.10. This is due to processing user-supplied input as a regular expression. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to create comments that can cause catastrophic backtracking and break pages.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **regular expression denial of service**
- **impact:** Denial of Service
- **attacker:** unauthenticated attackers
- **product:** Minify HTML WordPress plugin
- **version:** up to and including 2.1.10

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-12579

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the Minify HTML plugin processing user-supplied input as a regular expression without proper sanitization. This leads to a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service):** The plugin uses a regular expression to process HTML comments. A specially crafted comment can cause catastrophic backtracking in the regex engine, leading to excessive resource consumption.
- **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption:** This is a direct result of the ReDoS vulnerability where malicious input leads to high CPU usage.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Attackers can cause the webserver to become unresponsive or significantly slow down.
- **Page Breakage:** The excessive processing can lead to pages not loading correctly, effectively breaking the website's functionality for legitimate users.
- **Limited Impact on Confidentiality/Integrity:** While the CVSS vector indicates low integrity impact, the primary impact is on availability. There's no indication of data theft or unauthorized modification.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Unauthenticated Attackers:** No authentication is required, making the vulnerability easily exploitable.
- **User-Supplied Input:** The vulnerability is triggered by specially crafted HTML comments.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests with the malicious comment to the target website.
- **No Special Privileges:** No user accounts or administrative privileges are required.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in Minify HTML plugin versions up to and including 2.1.10.
- The patch is included in version 2.1.11 where the vulnerable regex was modified.
- The patch removes a vulnerable regex `/~~<!--(?!\s\*(?:\[if [^\]]+]|<!|>))(?:(?!-->).)\*-->'` and replaces it with `/(?=<!--)([\s\S]\*?)-->'`.
- The fix was implemented in changeset 3203890.
