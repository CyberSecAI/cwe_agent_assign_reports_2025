  "description": "The Minify HTML plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in all versions up to, and including, 2.1.10. This is due to processing user-supplied input as a regular expression. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to create comments that can cause catastrophic backtracking and break pages.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-12579\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability is due to the Minify HTML plugin processing user-supplied input as a regular expression without proper sanitization. This leads to a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service):** The plugin uses a regular expression to process HTML comments. A specially crafted comment can cause catastrophic backtracking in the regex engine, leading to excessive resource consumption.\n- **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption:** This is a direct result of the ReDoS vulnerability where malicious input leads to high CPU usage.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Attackers can cause the webserver to become unresponsive or significantly slow down.\n- **Page Breakage:** The excessive processing can lead to pages not loading correctly, effectively breaking the website's functionality for legitimate users.\n- **Limited Impact on Confidentiality/Integrity:** While the CVSS vector indicates low integrity impact, the primary impact is on availability. There's no indication of data theft or unauthorized modification.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Unauthenticated Attackers:** No authentication is required, making the vulnerability easily exploitable.\n- **User-Supplied Input:** The vulnerability is triggered by specially crafted HTML comments.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests with the malicious comment to the target website.\n- **No Special Privileges:** No user accounts or administrative privileges are required.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n- The vulnerability exists in Minify HTML plugin versions up to and including 2.1.10.\n- The patch is included in version 2.1.11 where the vulnerable regex was modified.\n- The patch removes a vulnerable regex `/~~<!--(?!\\s\\*(?:\\[if [^\\]]+]|<!|>))(?:(?!-->).)\\*-->'` and replaces it with `/(?=<!--)([\\s\\S]\\*?)-->'`.\n- The fix was implemented in changeset 3203890.",

CWE-400 is a broader category that describes the impact of the vulnerability, which is the consumption of excessive resources leading to a denial-of-service condition. CWE-1333 can lead to CWE-400, representing a cause-and-effect relationship.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1333[\"CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    \n    cwe1333 -->|CAN_LEAD_TO| cwe400\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe1333 primary\n    class cwe400 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the plugin using an inefficient regular expression (CWE-1333) on user-supplied input. This leads to catastrophic backtracking and excessive resource consumption, resulting in a denial-of-service (CWE-400).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the vulnerability description and the CVE reference content summary. The key evidence supporting the selection of CWE-1333 is the explicit mention of \"Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)\" and the fact that the plugin processes \"user-supplied input as a regular expression\". This aligns perfectly with the description of CWE-1333. The evidence for CWE-400 is the \"Denial of Service (DoS)\" impact, which results from the excessive resource consumption.\n\nThe graph relationships helped clarify the relationship between the root cause (CWE-1333) and the impact (CWE-400). CWE-1333 is at the optimal level of specificity as it directly identifies the inefficient regular expression as the source of the vulnerability, rather than a more general input validation issue.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.\n\n## CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a regular expression with an inefficient, possibly exponential worst-case computational complexity that consumes excessive CPU cycles.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.67\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
