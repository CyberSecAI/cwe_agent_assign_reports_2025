  "description": "An ****improper authorization** vulnerability** exists in lunary-ai/lunary version 1.5.5. The /users/me/org endpoint lacks adequate access control mechanisms, allowing unauthorized users to access sensitive information about all team members in the current organization. This vulnerability can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information such as names, roles, or emails to users without sufficient privileges, resulting in privacy violations and potential reconnaissance for targeted attacks.",

It only shows that patches were applied.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\nThe impact of exploitation is not detailed in the provided content.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\nThe attack vectors are not detailed in the provided content.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\nThe required attacker capabilities/position are not detailed in the provided content.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\nThe commit applies security patches to several files:\n*   `evaluator.ts`: Added authorization check `checkAccess(\"evaluations\", \"list\")` to the `/` route.\n*   `models.ts`: Added authorization checks `checkAccess(\"settings\", \"read\")` and `checkAccess(\"settings\", \"update\")` to POST and PATCH routes.\n*   `projects/index.ts`: Added a check `hasAccess(userRole, \"privateKeys\", \"read\")` before including private API keys in the response.\n*   `users.ts`: Added a check to prevent billing role modification by non-owners.\n*   `team.tsx`: Added a check to disable the \"billing\" role selection for non-owner users.\n\nThe changes primarily focus on access control and authorization, suggesting the vulnerabilities likely involved unauthorized access or modification of resources.\n\n**More detail than official CVE description:**\nYes, the content provides more detail than a placeholder CVE description. It lists the specific files modified and the nature of the changes (adding access control checks). However, it does not specify the exact vulnerabilities being addressed.",

The Retriever Results and the Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance pointed towards CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) as the most relevant CWE. This is because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions the lack of access control mechanisms, indicating a missing authorization check. The evidence from the vulnerability description key phrases clearly indicates \"**weakness: improper authorization**\" and the impact is \"access sensitive information, data disclosure\". The provided mitigation steps in the CVE Reference Links Content Summary further support this, detailing the addition of authorization checks in various files to address unauthorized access.\nCWE-200 is a secondary consequence of this **missing authorization**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
