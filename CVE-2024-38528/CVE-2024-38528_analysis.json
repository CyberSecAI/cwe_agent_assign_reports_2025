  "description": "nptd-rs is a tool for synchronizing your computers clock, implementing the NTP and NTS protocols. There is a **missing limit for accepted NTS-KE connections**. This allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to crash ntpd-rs when an NTS-KE server is configured. Non NTS-KE server configurations, such as the default ntpd-rs configuration, are unaffected. This vulnerability has been patched in version 1.1.3.",

  "reference_content": "- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing limit for accepted NTS-KE connections. When ntpd-rs is configured as an NTS server, it accepts TCP connections for the NTS-KE service. If the process has reached the file descriptor limit and tries to accept a new TCP connection, the accept() system call will return with the EMFILE error, causing ntpd-rs to abort.\n- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Resource exhaustion due to unlimited accepted NTS-KE connections. Specifically, the vulnerability is categorized as CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling.\n- **Impact of exploitation:** The ntpd-rs daemon can be made completely unavailable by crashing the service. If ntpd-rs is automatically restarted, an attacker can repeat the attack to prevent it from functioning properly. This affects only NTS-KE server configurations.\n- **Attack vectors:** A remote attacker can open a large number of parallel TCP connections to the server to exhaust file descriptors and trigger a crash.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the affected ntpd-rs server and open multiple TCP connections quickly enough to avoid the `key-exchange-timeout-ms` timeout. No authentication or user interaction is required.",

The vulnerability is caused by a **missing limit for accepted NTS-KE connections**, which allows an attacker to exhaust resources. |\n| CWE-400 | Uncontrolled Resource Consumption | 0.7 | Class | Allowed | Secondary Candidate. CWE-400 is a parent of CWE-770. Resource exhaustion leads to the service crashing. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship that influenced the decision was the parent-child relationship between CWE-400 and CWE-770. CWE-770 is a more specific type of resource consumption, focusing on allocation without limits, while CWE-400 is a broader category. Given the specific nature of the vulnerability (allocation of NTS-KE connections without limits), CWE-770 was chosen as the primary CWE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    \n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe770 primary\n    class cwe400 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing limit for accepted NTS-KE connections** (CWE-770), leading to resource exhaustion, and ultimately causing the ntpd-rs service to crash.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary. The vulnerability stems from a **missing limit** on accepted NTS-KE connections, leading to resource exhaustion and a denial-of-service condition. The evidence is strong, and the mapping aligns with the described weakness.\n\nThe vulnerability description clearly states the root cause as a \"**missing limit for accepted NTS-KE connections**.\" The CVE Reference Links Content Summary explicitly mentions \"**Resource exhaustion due to unlimited accepted NTS-KE connections. Specifically, the vulnerability is categorized as CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling.**\"\n\nThe selection of CWE-770 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **allocation of resources without limits**, which is the core issue in this vulnerability. While CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) is a broader category, CWE-770 provides a more precise description of the weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-617: Reachable Assertion\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains an assert() or similar statement that can be triggered by an attacker, which leads to an application exit or other behavior that is more severe than necessary.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-208: Observable Timing Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTwo separate operations in a product require different amounts of time to complete, in a way that is observable to an actor and reveals security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
