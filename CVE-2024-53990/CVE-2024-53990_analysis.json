  "description": "The AsyncHttpClient (AHC) library allows Java applications to easily execute HTTP requests and asynchronously process HTTP responses. When making any HTTP request, the automatically enabled and **self-managed CookieStore** (aka cookie jar) will silently replace explicitly defined Cookies with any that have the same name from the cookie jar. For services that operate with multiple users, this can result in one users Cookie being used for another users requests.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-53990:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nThe `CookieStore` in the AsyncHttpClient library automatically and silently replaces explicitly defined cookies in an HTTP request with cookies of the same name from the cookie jar. This occurs because the library uses `addOrReplaceCookie()` instead of `addCookieIfUnset()`.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Incorrect Cookie Handling:** The library's `CookieStore` overwrites explicitly set cookies with those from its internal store, leading to unexpected behavior.\n- **Lack of Prioritization:**  Explicitly defined cookies should take precedence over those stored in the cookie jar, but this is not the case in the vulnerable versions.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Session Hijacking:** In services with multiple users, an attacker could potentially cause one user's cookie to be used for another user's requests.\n- **Data Exposure:** This can lead to the exposure of sensitive user data or other information if the application does not reject requests with incorrect authentication.\n- **Broken Third-party Auth:** If a service uses third-party auth and token refresh mechanisms, this vulnerability can break the auth process due to the cookie replacement.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- The attack vector is primarily network-based. An attacker doesn't need specific user privileges or interaction.\n- An attacker would need to control a request which contains the same cookie name as one stored in the client's cookie store.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n-  An attacker would need to have the ability to make HTTP requests via the vulnerable AsyncHttpClient implementation.\n-  They need to be able to induce an action that results in the `CookieStore` containing a cookie with the same name as one they wish to inject.\n\n**Additional details from the provided content:**\n- The issue was initially reported as a bug, not as a security vulnerability.\n- A fix was implemented to only set cookies from the `CookieStore` if they are not already set by the request.\n- A workaround exists by disabling the `CookieStore` during client creation.\n-  The vulnerability affects AsyncHttpClient versions >= 2.1.0, < 2.12.4 and >= 3.0.0.Beta1, < 3.0.1.\n- Patched versions are 2.12.4 and 3.0.1.\n- The vulnerability is rated as critical with a CVSS score of 9.2.\n- The vulnerability is tracked as GHSA-mfj5-cf8g-g2fv.\n- The vulnerability has been mitigated in Apache Pulsar by disabling CookieStore as a short term mitigation strategy. A full upgrade to a fixed version of `async-http-client` will be needed.\n\nThe provided content gives a good understanding of the vulnerability, its impact, and how it can be mitigated.",

The vulnerability involves **incorrect cookie handling**, where the system relies on cookies without proper validation. While several CWEs relate to sensitive data and cookies, the core issue is the reliance on potentially incorrect cookie data. The chain relationship is that **improper cookie handling** (CWE-565) can lead to **insertion of sensitive information** (CWE-201) into requests.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe565[\"CWE-565: Reliance on Cookies without Validation and Integrity Checking\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n\n    cwe565 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe201\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe565 primary\n    class cwe201 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **reliance on cookies without proper validation** (CWE-565). Because the CookieStore silently overwrites cookies, this leads to the potential **insertion of one user's cookie data into another user's request** (CWE-201), effectively inserting sensitive information where it shouldn't be.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nMy analysis is based on the provided evidence, particularly the CVE Reference Links Content Summary and Vulnerability Description. The core issue is the **incorrect handling of cookies** within the AsyncHttpClient library. The `CookieStore` silently replaces explicitly defined cookies with those from its internal store, leading to unexpected behavior.\n\nThe relationship graph influenced my selection by clarifying the potential flow of the vulnerability. The primary weakness is the **reliance on cookies without validation**, and the resulting action is the **insertion of incorrect data**.\n\nI've selected CWEs at the Base level to accurately represent the specific weaknesses present in the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this
