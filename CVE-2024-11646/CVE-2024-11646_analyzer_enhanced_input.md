### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **sql injection**
- **product:** 1000 Projects Beauty Parlour Management System
- **version:** 1
- **component:** /admin/edit-services.php

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's the analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability exists in the `admin/edit-services.php` file of the "Beauty Parlour Management System PHP SQLite Project".
- The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization or validation of the 'sername' parameter, which is directly used in SQL queries. This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code by manipulating the 'sername' parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Unsanitized user input: The application fails to sanitize or validate the user-supplied 'sername' parameter before using it in SQL queries.
- Direct use of user input in SQL queries: The application directly incorporates user-provided data into SQL queries without using prepared statements or parameter binding.
- Time-based blind SQL injection: The vulnerability is exploitable using time-based blind SQL injection techniques.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthorized database access: Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database.
- Sensitive data leakage: Attackers can access and exfiltrate sensitive data stored in the database.
- Data tampering: Attackers can modify or delete data within the database.
- System control: Attackers can potentially gain comprehensive control over the system by manipulating the database.
- Service interruption: Exploitation can lead to service interruption.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `admin/edit-services.php` file.
- The vulnerable parameter is `sername`, which is submitted via a POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the affected application.
- The attacker does not need prior login or authorization to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious payload in the 'sername' parameter to perform SQL injection.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is a time-based blind SQL injection, as demonstrated in the provided example with a `SLEEP(5)` function.
- The provided SQLMap command shows how to test and exploit this vulnerability with the command:
```
sqlmap -u "http://10.211.55.6:1112/admin/edit-services.php?editid=1" --data="sername=O3+Facial111&cost=1200&submit=" --cookie="PHPSESSID=590ushp8n3aqabqpe4p1cpmeov" --batch --level=5 --risk=3 --dbms=mysql --dbs --random-agent
```
- The vulnerable parameter is specifically identified as 'sername' within the POST request.
- The payload example is: `sername=1111111' AND (SELECT 6074 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))aOPX) AND 'lear'='lear&cost=1111111&submit=`

**Suggested Repairs:**
- Use prepared statements with parameter binding: This will prevent SQL injection by treating user input as data, not SQL code.
- Implement input validation and filtering: Validate and filter user inputs to conform to expected formats and limit malicious content.
- Minimize database user permissions: Use database accounts with the least privileges needed for specific operations.
- Conduct regular security audits: To identify and fix security vulnerabilities.

This detailed description provides a clear understanding of the SQL injection vulnerability in the Beauty Parlour Management System, its causes, impact, and how it can be mitigated.
