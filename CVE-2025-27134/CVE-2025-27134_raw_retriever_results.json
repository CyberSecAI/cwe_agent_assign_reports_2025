Prior to version 3.3.3, a privilege escalation vulnerability exists in the Joplin server, allowing non-admin users to exploit the API endpoint `PATCH /api/users/id` to set the `is_admin` field to 1. The vulnerability allows malicious low-privileged users to perform administrative actions without proper authorization. This issue has been patched in version 3.3.3.",
