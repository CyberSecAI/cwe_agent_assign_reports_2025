  "description": "Versions of the package sinatra from 0.0.0 are vulnerable to Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision via the X-Forwarded-Host (XFH) header. When making a request to a method with redirect applied, it is possible to trigger an **Open Redirect Attack** by inserting an arbitrary address into this header. If used for caching purposes, such as with servers like Nginx, or as a reverse proxy, without handling the X-Forwarded-Host header, attackers can potentially exploit Cache Poisoning or Routing-based SSRF.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-21510:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from the improper handling of the `X-Forwarded-Host` (XFH) header in the sinatra framework. The application uses the value of the XFH header to construct URLs for redirects, without proper validation or sanitization.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision (CWE-807):** The application trusts the value provided in the `X-Forwarded-Host` header without verifying its validity or origin.\n*   **Open Redirect:** By injecting a malicious URL into the `X-Forwarded-Host` header, an attacker can force the application to redirect users to an arbitrary website.\n*   **Cache Poisoning/Routing-based SSRF:** When the application is used behind a reverse proxy or caching server that does not handle XFH headers properly, the injected malicious host can be cached and served to other users. This can be exploited to conduct Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks, by redirecting requests to internal or controlled resources.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Open Redirect:** Attackers can redirect users to phishing sites or other malicious content.\n*   **Cache Poisoning:** Attackers can poison the cache and serve malicious content or redirects to other users.\n*   **Routing-based SSRF:** Attackers can exploit internal services or other resources through the application via the manipulated redirects.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   The primary attack vector is through the `X-Forwarded-Host` HTTP header.\n*   An attacker can manipulate the XFH header during an HTTP request.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application.\n*   The attacker does not require any special privileges.\n*   Some user interaction may be required (e.g. clicking a manipulated link).\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n* The provided GitHub pull request ([https://github.com/sinatra/sinatra/pull/2010](https://github.com/sinatra/sinatra/pull/2010)) was an attempt to address the issue by adding a setting to optionally use the X-Forwarded-Host header, but was deemed insufficient because it didn't account for the `forwarded` header.\n* A proper fix involves either sanitizing or validating the XFH header, or, as recommended by some reviewers in the PR, allowing an administrator to define trusted hosts.\n* The vulnerability affects sinatra versions >=1.2.0.c and <4.1.0.\n* The Snyk vulnerability report indicates that a proof-of-concept exploit exists and the vulnerability has a medium severity (5.3 according to CVSS v3.1).",
