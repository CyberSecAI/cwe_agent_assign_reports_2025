# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-57081

## Vulnerability Description
A **prototype pollution** in the lib.fromQuery function of underscore-contrib v0.3.0 allows attackers to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) via supplying a crafted payload.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **component:** lib.fromQuery function
- **rootcause:** **prototype pollution**
- **vector:** supplying a crafted payload
- **product:** underscore-contrib
- **impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), Denial of Service
- **attacker:** attackers
- **version:** v0.3.0

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability is due to the `lib.fromQuery` function in the `underscore-contrib` library not properly sanitizing user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to manipulate the prototype chain via Prototype Pollution.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Prototype Pollution: The `lib.fromQuery` function is susceptible to Prototype Pollution attacks.

Impact of exploitation:
- Denial of Service (DoS)
- Potential for other injection-based attacks if the polluted property propagates to sensitive Node.js APIs (e.g., exec, eval), potentially leading to arbitrary command execution.

Attack vectors:
- An attacker can supply a payload with an `Object.prototype` setter to the `lib.fromQuery` function.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker needs to be able to control the input to the `lib.fromQuery` function.

Mitigation or fix:
- The advisory does not specify a fix, but suggests input sanitization is needed.
