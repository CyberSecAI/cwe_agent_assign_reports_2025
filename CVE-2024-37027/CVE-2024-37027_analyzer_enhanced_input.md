- **impact:** denial of service
- **attacker:** authenticated user
- **product:** Intel(R) VTune(TM) Profiler software
- **version:** before version 2024.2.0

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2024-37027:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** Improper Input validation

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The Intel VTune Profiler software has an issue with how it validates user inputs.

**Impact of Exploitation:** A successful exploit could lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

**Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is local access (AV:L). An attacker needs to have local access to the system where the vulnerable software is installed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with local access (PR:L). The attacker must also induce the user to perform an action (UI:R for CVSS 3.1, UI:P for CVSS 4.0).

**Affected Products:**
    * Intel® VTune™ Profiler software before version 2024.2.0.
    * Intel® oneAPI Base Toolkit before version 2024.2.0.
    * Intel® System Bring-up Toolkit before version 2024.2.0.

**Mitigation:** Update the affected software to version 2024.2.0 or later.

**CVSS Metrics:**

*   **CVSS v3.1:** 6.1 (Medium)
    *   AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:H
*   **CVSS v4.0:** 5.2 (Medium)
    *   AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:P/VC:L/VI:L/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N
