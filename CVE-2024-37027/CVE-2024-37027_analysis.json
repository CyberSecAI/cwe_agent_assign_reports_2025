  "reference_content": "Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2024-37027:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** Improper Input validation\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The Intel VTune Profiler software has an issue with how it validates user inputs.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:** A successful exploit could lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.\n\n**Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is local access (AV:L). An attacker needs to have local access to the system where the vulnerable software is installed.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with local access (PR:L). The attacker must also induce the user to perform an action (UI:R for CVSS 3.1, UI:P for CVSS 4.0).\n\n**Affected Products:**\n    * Intel\u00ae VTune\u2122 Profiler software before version 2024.2.0.\n    * Intel\u00ae oneAPI Base Toolkit before version 2024.2.0.\n    * Intel\u00ae System Bring-up Toolkit before version 2024.2.0.\n\n**Mitigation:** Update the affected software to version 2024.2.0 or later.\n\n**CVSS Metrics:**\n\n*   **CVSS v3.1:** 6.1 (Medium)\n    *   AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:H\n*   **CVSS v4.0:** 5.2 (Medium)\n    *   AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:P/VC:L/VI:L/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N\n\nThe document indicates that the vulnerability was reported by ch4rli3kop.",

While discouraged for direct mapping, the provided vulnerability description and reference links strongly emphasize **improper input validation** as the root cause. There's a potential child relationship to more specific input validation CWEs, but the provided information lacks the necessary detail to pinpoint a specific variant.\n\nCWE-755 [CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions] is considered as a secondary weakness, stemming from the **improper input validation**. If the input is not properly validated, exceptional conditions may not be handled correctly.\n\nCWE-787 [CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write] is considered as a potential weakness due to the impact of denial of service.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe755[\"CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n\n    cwe755 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe20\n    cwe787 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe20\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe20 primary\n    class cwe755,cwe787 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper input validation** (CWE-20 [CWE-20: Improper Input Validation]), which leads to potential mishandling of exceptional conditions (CWE-755 [CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions]) and a denial-of-service impact.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly pointed to CWE-20 [CWE-20: Improper Input Validation] due to the explicit mention of \"**Improper Input validation**\" in both the vulnerability description and the CVE reference summary. Despite the discouraged usage of CWE-20 [CWE-20: Improper Input Validation], its direct match to the provided evidence makes it the most appropriate primary classification.\n\nThe final selection is based on the available evidence, prioritizing the root cause as identified in the vulnerability description. CWE-20 [CWE-20: Improper Input Validation] serves as the initial point. The lack of detailed information prevents a more specific mapping to a variant of input validation weaknesses.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input or data, but it does\n        not validate or incorrectly validates that the input has the\n        properties that are required to process the data safely and\n        correctly.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-20 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available [REF-1287].
