## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-3379 Content

This content **RELATES** to a vulnerability in PCMan FTP Server, specifically a remote buffer overflow in the `EPSV` command. It provides a detailed exploit script.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the handling of the `EPSV` command in PCMan FTP Server version 2.0.7. The exploit script suggests the overflow occurs due to insufficient bounds checking when processing the input provided with the `EPSV` command.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** The core vulnerability is a buffer overflow.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** Lack of proper input validation allows an attacker to send a crafted `EPSV` command exceeding the buffer's capacity.

**Impact of exploitation:**

Successful exploitation allows the attacker to overwrite the execution flow of the program, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution. The script aims to redirect execution to a shellcode payload.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Remote Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over the network via the FTP protocol.
*   **EPSV Command:** The attack vector is specifically the `EPSV` command.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the target PCMan FTP Server.
*   **FTP Client:** The attacker needs an FTP client to send the crafted `EPSV` command.
*   **Shellcode Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to create shellcode compatible with the target architecture (Windows x86 in this case).

**Mitigation or fix:**

The provided content does not include mitigation or fix information. However, the general mitigation for buffer overflows includes:

*   **Input Validation:** Implement robust input validation to ensure that the size of the input data does not exceed the buffer's capacity.
*   **Safe String Handling:** Use safe string handling functions that prevent buffer overflows.
*   **Update Software:** Update to a patched version of PCMan FTP Server if available.

**Additional Details (More detail than official CVE description):**

*   **Specific Version:** The exploit is tested against version 2.0.7 of PCMan FTP Server.
*   **Offset and EIP:** The script identifies an offset of 2006 bytes and uses `0x74e32fd9` as the EIP address (jump to ESP).
*   **Shellcode:** The script includes shellcode generated using `msfvenom` to establish a reverse TCP shell.
*   **Bad Characters:** The script handles bad characters (`\x00\x0a\x0d`) during shellcode generation.
*   **Exploit Script:** A complete Perl exploit script is provided, demonstrating the steps to connect to the FTP server, authenticate, and send the malicious `EPSV` command.
*   **Target OS:** Tested on Windows XP SP3.
