## Vulnerability Description
An attacker with local access the to medical office computer can escalate his Windows user privileges to NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM by exploiting a **command injection** vulnerability in the Elefant Update Service. The **command injection** can be exploited by communicating with the Elefant Update Service which is running as SYSTEM via Windows Named Pipes.The Elefant Software Updater (ESU) consists of two components. An ESU service which runs as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM and an ESU tray client which communicates with the service to update or repair the installation and is running with user permissions. The communication is implemented using named pipes. A crafted message of type MessageType.SupportServiceInfos can be sent to the local ESU service to inject commands, which are then executed as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **command injection**
- **impact:** escalate Windows user privileges to NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
- **vector:** crafted message of type MessageType.SupportServiceInfos
- **attacker:** attacker with local access
- **product:** Elefant Update Service

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2024-50591:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a command injection flaw within the Elefant Software Updater (ESU) service. This service runs with "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM" privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Command Injection:** The ESU service improperly handles input sent via named pipes, specifically in the `CollectServiceInfos` function related to "MessageType.SupportServiceInfos". User-provided input is directly used in a command execution without sufficient sanitization or filtering.
- **Named Pipe Communication:** The communication between the ESU tray client (user-level) and the ESU service (SYSTEM-level) occurs through named pipes, which allows for the injection of malicious data.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** Input provided to the `CollectServiceInfos` function is not sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary commands.
- **Unfiltered Path Creation:** Before the command injection sink, a directory is created from a portion of the input. While specific characters are restricted due to Windows limitations, the '&' character remains usable for command chaining.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows a local attacker to escalate their privileges from a regular user to "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM." This enables the attacker to perform arbitrary actions on the system, such as installing software, modifying system configurations, accessing sensitive data, and potentially compromising the entire system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the medical office computer where the Elefant software and ESU are installed.
- **Named Pipe Communication:** The attack involves sending a crafted message via named pipes to the ESU service.
- **Command Injection:** The attacker injects a malicious command into the `CollectServiceInfos` function parameter, which is then executed by the ESU service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:**  The attacker must have a local user account on the target machine.
- **Knowledge of Named Pipe Communication:** The attacker must be able to communicate with the ESU service via named pipes and know how to craft a message to trigger the command injection.
- **Command Injection Knowledge:** The attacker needs to craft a working command-injection payload that bypasses basic Windows path restrictions.
- **Payload Delivery:** The attacker needs to deliver the attack payload via the client, using the service to execute commands.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is in the `CollectServiceInfos` function of the Elefant Software Updater Service.
- The input is split by ';' but does not properly filter characters that can be used for command injection like '&'.
- The attacker injects commands that are executed as "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM".
- The proof of concept demonstrated the ability to execute a PowerShell script as "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM" by injecting a payload via a modified "Info" function in the ESU tray client.
- The injection occurs before the path is created, and the injected command will be executed once the directory creation is successful.
- The provided proof of concept uses a PowerShell command to write the username to a file on the system.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability is part of a set of multiple vulnerabilities found in HASOMED Elefant and Elefant Software Updater.
- The identified vulnerabilities include unprotected database access, an unprotected FHIR API, and other local privilege escalation flaws.
- The vendor has released patches to address these vulnerabilities.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* 🔍 *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* 🔍 *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion – CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### 🔸 CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ✅ *“A user created with the ‘guest’ role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ✅ *“The backup service runs as root but only needs read access.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ⚠️ This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### 🔸 CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ✅ *“User can access another user’s invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.”*

## Mapping Examples – Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *“User can escalate privileges to admin.”*
> ❌ Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged – only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ✅ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**
