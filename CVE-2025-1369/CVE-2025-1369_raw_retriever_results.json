  "query": "A vulnerability classified as critical was found in MicroWord eScan Antivirus 7.0.32 on Linux. Affected by this vulnerability is an unknown functionality of the component USB Password Handler. The manipulation leads to os command injection. The attack needs to be approached locally. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation appears to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",
