  "description": "A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, was found in rizinorg rizin up to 0.8.0. This affects the function rz_utf8_encode in the library /librz/util/utf8.c. The manipulation leads to **heap-based buffer overflow**. An attack has to be approached locally. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue.",

Here's a breakdown of the information:\n\n*   **Root cause:** The vulnerability is a heap-buffer-overflow occurring in the `rz_utf8_encode` function within `librz/util/utf8.c`.\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Heap-buffer-overflow.\n*   **Impact of exploitation:** Segment fault, leading to a crash.\n*   **Attack vectors:** Running `rz-bin -z -N\":<dH\" $poc` with a specially crafted input file (`rz-bin-poc-01.zip`).\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to execute commands on the system and provide a malicious input file.\n*   **Mitigation or fix:** The issue was addressed and closed by pull request #4919. The pull request description indicates a significant refactoring of string, regex, and byte search functionality, including fixes for the heap-buffer-overflow.\n\nThe content provides more detail than a typical CVE description, including the specific function involved, the command-line arguments to trigger the vulnerability, and the stack trace from the AddressSanitizer (ASan).",

CWE-122 is a more specific variant of CWE-119, which makes it a better fit given the evidence.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe122[\"CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n\n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe122 primary\n    class cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain consists of the **heap-based buffer overflow** due to manipulation of the `rz_utf8_encode` function.
