- **version:** DWR-2000M_1.34ME

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-28729:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a flaw in the implementation of the brute force protection mechanism in the D-Link DWR-2000M router. The router intends to block login attempts after three failed tries, but this protection can be bypassed due to a flaw in its implementation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Incorrect Access Control:** The primary weakness is that the router's brute force protection mechanism can be easily bypassed.
- **Insufficient Validation:** The device fails to properly validate login attempts, allowing attackers to bypass the intended block after multiple failed login attempts.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Bypassing Brute Force Protection:** An attacker can bypass the device's login attempt blocking mechanism, allowing them to attempt unlimited login attempts without being blocked, increasing the chances of success.
- **Potential Unauthorized Access:** If successful in brute forcing the login credentials, an attacker gains unauthorized access to the router's admin panel, enabling them to modify settings, potentially compromising the network and connected devices.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Brute Force Attack:** The vulnerability is exploited via a brute-force attack on the router's login panel.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the router's admin panel, either locally or remotely if the admin panel is exposed to the internet.
- **Knowledge of Target Device:** The attacker needs to know the specific model of the target device to correctly target the attack.
- **Ability to capture and resend requests:** The attacker must be able to capture login requests, send multiple requests quickly, and ignore block messages to bypass the failed login limit.
