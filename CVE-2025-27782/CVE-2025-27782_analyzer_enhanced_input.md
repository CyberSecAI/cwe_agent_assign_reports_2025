## Vulnerability Description
Applio is a voice conversion tool. Versions 3.2.8-bugfix and prior are vulnerable to **arbitrary file write** in inference.py. This issue may lead to writing arbitrary files on the Applio server. It can also be used in conjunction with an **unsafe deserialization** to achieve remote code execution. As of time of publication, no known patches are available.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **unsafe deserialization**
- **weakness:** **arbitrary file write**
- **impact:** remote code execution
- **product:** Applio
- **version:** 3.2.8-bugfix and prior
- **component:** inference.py

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-27782 based on provided content

The provided content details 13 vulnerabilities found in Applio, ranging from SSRF and arbitrary file writes to unsafe deserialization and arbitrary file removal. CVE-2025-27782 is specifically mapped to **GHSL-2024-349**, which is an **Arbitrary file write in inference.py**.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability details extracted from the content:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The `output_tts_path` in `tts.py` takes arbitrary user input and passes it to a function in `core.py` that removes the file if it exists.  There are no restrictions on the path provided, allowing attackers to remove arbitrary files on the server.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Arbitrary File Write
*   Lack of input validation/sanitization on user-supplied file paths.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Arbitrary file removal on the Applio server.
*   Potential for remote code execution when combined with other vulnerabilities (e.g., unsafe deserialization).

**Attack vectors:**

*   An attacker can supply a malicious file path through the `output_tts_path` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to provide input to the `output_tts_path` parameter.
*   The user running the application must have write access to the targeted path.

**Mitigation or fix:**

The content does not specify a fix, but implies that proper input validation and sanitization of file paths are necessary to prevent this vulnerability.

**Note:** This content provides significantly more detail than a typical CVE description, including specific file names, line numbers, and explanations of how the vulnerability can be exploited.
