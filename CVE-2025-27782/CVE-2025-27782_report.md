# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2025-27782

## Description

Applio is a voice conversion tool. Versions 3.2.8-bugfix and prior are vulnerable to **arbitrary file write** in inference.py. This issue may lead to writing arbitrary files on the Applio server. It can also be used in conjunction with an **unsafe deserialization** to achieve remote code execution. As of time of publication, no known patches are available.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Rootcause:** unsafe deserialization
- **Weakness:** arbitrary file write
- **Impact:** remote code execution
- **Product:** Applio
- **Version:** 3.2.8-bugfix and prior
- **Component:** inference.py

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-502 | Deserialization of Untrusted Data | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE. Matches the explicit mention of "unsafe deserialization" as a root cause. |
| CWE-73 | External Control of File Name or Path | 0.8 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. Accounts for the "arbitrary file write" vulnerability, where the file path is externally controlled. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship influencing the decision is the CANPRECEDE relationship.
  - CWE-73 can precede CWE-502, indicating that external control of a file path can set the stage for deserialization vulnerabilities.
  - The abstraction levels were considered to ensure the most specific and accurate representation of the vulnerabilities.
  - CWE-502 and CWE-73 are both Base level CWEs, representing specific weaknesses.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **external control of the file name or path (CWE-73)**. This allows an attacker to manipulate the file path used in subsequent operations. This can then lead to **deserialization of untrusted data (CWE-502)**, allowing for potential remote code execution.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is primarily based on the provided evidence, which explicitly mentions "unsafe deserialization" and "arbitrary file write." The vulnerability description and CVE reference summary directly support the selection of CWE-502 and CWE-73.

The graph relationships and retriever results further support these selections. The CANPRECEDE relationship between CWE-73 and CWE-502 helps understand the potential chain of exploitation.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, representing the root cause and contributing factor to the vulnerability.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-1286: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input that is expected to be well-formed - i.e., to comply with a certain syntax - but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input complies with the syntax.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-346: Origin Validation Error
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly verify that the source of data or communication is valid.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently ensuring that the resulting data will be valid.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73

## CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73

## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as ".." that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.
