  "description": "Applio is a voice conversion tool. Versions 3.2.8-bugfix and prior are vulnerable to **arbitrary file write** in inference.py. This issue may lead to writing arbitrary files on the Applio server. It can also be used in conjunction with an **unsafe deserialization** to achieve remote code execution.

  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-27782 based on provided content\n\nThe provided content details 13 vulnerabilities found in Applio, ranging from SSRF and arbitrary file writes to unsafe deserialization and arbitrary file removal. CVE-2025-27782 is specifically mapped to **GHSL-2024-349**, which is an **Arbitrary file write in inference.py**.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the vulnerability details extracted from the content:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe `output_tts_path` in `tts.py` takes arbitrary user input and passes it to a function in `core.py` that removes the file if it exists.  There are no restrictions on the path provided, allowing attackers to remove arbitrary files on the server.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Arbitrary File Write\n*   Lack of input validation/sanitization on user-supplied file paths.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   Arbitrary file removal on the Applio server.\n*   Potential for remote code execution when combined with other vulnerabilities (e.g., unsafe deserialization).\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   An attacker can supply a malicious file path through the `output_tts_path` parameter.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   The attacker needs to be able to provide input to the `output_tts_path` parameter.\n*   The user running the application must have write access to the targeted path.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\nThe content does not specify a fix, but implies that proper input validation and sanitization of file paths are necessary to prevent this vulnerability.\n\n**Note:** This content provides significantly more detail than a typical CVE description, including specific file names, line numbers, and explanations of how the vulnerability can be exploited.",

Matches the explicit mention of \"unsafe deserialization\" as a root cause. |\n| CWE-73 | External Control of File Name or Path | 0.8 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. Accounts for the \"arbitrary file write\" vulnerability, where the file path is externally controlled. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship influencing the decision is the CANPRECEDE relationship.\n  - CWE-73 can precede CWE-502, indicating that external control of a file path can set the stage for deserialization vulnerabilities.\n  - The abstraction levels were considered to ensure the most specific and accurate representation of the vulnerabilities.\n  - CWE-502 and CWE-73 are both Base level CWEs, representing specific weaknesses.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe502[\"CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data\"]\n    cwe73[\"CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\"]\n    \n    cwe73 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe502\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe502 primary\n    class cwe73 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **external control of the file name or path (CWE-73)**. This allows an attacker to manipulate the file path used in subsequent operations. This can then lead to **deserialization of untrusted data (CWE-502)**, allowing for potential remote code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is primarily based on the provided evidence, which explicitly mentions \"unsafe deserialization\" and \"arbitrary file write.\" The vulnerability description and CVE reference summary directly support the selection of CWE-502 and CWE-73.\n\nThe graph relationships and retriever results further support these selections. The CANPRECEDE relationship between CWE-73 and CWE-502 helps understand the potential chain of exploitation.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, representing the root cause and contributing factor to the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1286: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input that is expected to be well-formed - i.e., to comply with a certain syntax - but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input complies with the syntax.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
