  "reference_content": "- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from how GitLab handles specially crafted table syntax within issue descriptions. When a table is created with rows that have a varying number of columns, the system automatically extends rows with too few columns. This extension process, when combined with a large table, results in a quadratic complexity issue during issue moves, leading to high CPU usage.\n- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:\n    - **Algorithmic Complexity Vulnerability**: The process of expanding table rows to a consistent number of columns during issue moves has a quadratic time complexity, making it vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks with a large table.\n    - **Lack of Input Validation**: There is insufficient validation or sanitization of the table syntax in issue descriptions, allowing for the creation of tables that trigger this high CPU usage.\n- **Impact of exploitation**:\n    - **Denial of Service (DoS)**: Exploiting this vulnerability results in high CPU usage for 60 seconds, causing request timeouts and making the GitLab instance unavailable.\n    - **Resource Exhaustion**: Multiple concurrent requests with the crafted input can exhaust server resources and disrupt the API/GraphQL endpoint.\n- **Attack vectors**:\n    - **Issue Description**: Attackers can inject the malicious table syntax into an issue description.\n    - **Move Issue Functionality**: The vulnerability is triggered when an issue containing the malicious table is moved to another project using the \"Move Selected\" feature or the graphql endpoint `moveIssue`.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:\n    - **Authenticated User**: An attacker must be an authenticated GitLab user with the ability to create and edit issues.\n    - **Project Access**: The attacker needs to have access to at least one project where they can create an issue and another project to move the issue to.\n\nThe provided content gives more detail than a typical CVE description, including the steps to reproduce, the vulnerable code, and the specific attack vector. The report also includes the attacker's test environment details and a video demonstration of the vulnerability.",

While it's generally discouraged to use Class-level CWEs when more specific Base or Variant levels are available, in this case, it accurately reflects the **uncontrolled resource consumption** that leads to the denial-of-service. CWE-1333 and CWE-1286 are considered as secondary candidates because they could be contributing factors to the resource consumption issue.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe1333[\"CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\"]\n    cwe1286[\"CWE-1286: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n\n    cwe1333 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe400\n    cwe1286 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe400\n    cwe400 -->|CHILDOF| cwe770\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe400 primary\n    class cwe1333,cwe1286 secondary\n    class cwe770 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **lack of input validation** (potentially CWE-1286), which allows an attacker to inject a specially crafted table syntax into an issue description. The system then inefficiently processes this syntax (potentially due to CWE-1333) when the issue is moved, leading to **uncontrolled resource consumption** (CWE-400) and ultimately a denial-of-service.\n  - **Root Cause(s):** Lack of Input Validation, Algorithmic Complexity\n  - **Weakness:** Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\n  - **Impact:** Denial of Service\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on the **uncontrolled resource consumption** that directly leads to the denial-of-service. The evidence from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary clearly states that the vulnerability allows an attacker to cause resource exhaustion via banzai pipeline, leading to high CPU usage and request timeouts.\n\nThe \"Root cause of vulnerability\" section explains the quadratic complexity issue when a table with varying columns is extended, causing high CPU usage during issue moves. This confirms the resource consumption aspect.\n\nWhile CWE-400 is a Class-level CWE and generally discouraged, it accurately captures the core issue. The relationship graph shows that CWE-400 can be preceded by CWE-1286 (Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input) or CWE-1333 (Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity), which could be contributing factors, but the primary weakness is the **uncontrolled resource consumption**. Therefore, CWE-400 is the most appropriate primary CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1286: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input that is expected to be well-formed - i.e., to comply with a certain syntax - but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input complies with the syntax.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-88: Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs a string for a command to be executed by a separate component\nin another control sphere, but it does not properly delimit the\nintended arguments, options, or switches within that command string.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-285: Improper Authorization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-285 is high-level and lower-level CWEs can frequently be used instead. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-696: Incorrect Behavior Order\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs multiple related behaviors, but the behaviors are performed in the wrong order in ways which may produce resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource, thereby enabling an actor to influence the amount of resources consumed, eventually leading to the exhaustion of available resources.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-400 is intended for incorrect behaviors in which the product is expected to track and restrict how many resources it consumes, but CWE-400 is often misused because it is conflated with the \"technical impact\" of vulnerabilities in which resource consumption occurs. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).\n\n## CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product generates an error message that includes sensitive information about its environment, users, or associated data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.

It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-696: Incorrect Behavior Order\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs multiple related behaviors, but the behaviors are performed in the wrong order in ways which may produce resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource, thereby enabling an actor to influence the amount of resources consumed, eventually leading to the exhaustion of available resources.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-400 is intended for incorrect behaviors in which the product is expected to track and restrict how many resources it consumes, but CWE-400 is often misused because it is conflated with the \"technical impact\" of vulnerabilities in which resource consumption occurs. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).\n\n## CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product generates an error message that includes sensitive information about its environment, users, or associated data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result,\n\n\n## CWE Relationship Analysis\n\nCurrent CWEs represent these abstraction levels: .\n\n\n### Vulnerability Chain Analysis\n\n**Chain starting from CWE-863:**\n- 863 (Incorrect Authorization) - ROOT\n\n\n**Chain starting from CWE-400:**\n- 400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) - ROOT\n\n\n\n### CWE Relationship Diagram\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n```",
