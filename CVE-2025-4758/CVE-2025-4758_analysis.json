The product constructs an SQL command using externally-influenced input, but it does not neutralize special elements. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship that influenced the decision was the direct match of the vulnerability description to the definition of CWE-89. The Retriever Results confirmed that CWE-89 is the most relevant CWE for SQL Injection vulnerabilities.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    \n    class cwe89 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain consists of a single step:\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** CWE-89 - Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection'). The application fails to sanitize user-provided input (`fname`) before using it in an SQL query.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the clear evidence provided in the vulnerability description and CVE reference. The **weakness** is identified as **sql injection**, and the **vector** is the manipulation of the `fname` argument in the `/contact.php` file. The CVE reference confirms that the `fname` parameter is directly used in SQL queries without proper sanitization.
