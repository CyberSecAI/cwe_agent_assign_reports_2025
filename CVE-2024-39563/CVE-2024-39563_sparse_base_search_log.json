A specific script in the Junos Space web application allows attacker-controlled input from a GET request without sufficient input sanitization. A specially crafted request can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary shell commands on the Junos Space Appliance. This issue affects Junos Space 24.1R1. Previous versions of Junos Space are unaffected by this vulnerability.",
