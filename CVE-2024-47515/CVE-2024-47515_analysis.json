  },
  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe vulnerability lies in the `generate_archive()` function of Pagure, which incorrectly handles symbolic links during repository archiving. Specifically, it follows symbolic links in temporary clones.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n- **Symbolic Link Following:** The function doesn't properly validate or sanitize symbolic links, causing it to follow them when creating archives. This allows a malicious user to craft a repository with symlinks that point to arbitrary locations on the server's filesystem.\n- **Local File Disclosure:** By following these symlinks, the `generate_archive()` function will include the contents of the target files in the generated archive, potentially exposing sensitive information.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Local File Disclosure:** Attackers can potentially gain access to sensitive files on the server, including configuration files, database credentials, and other confidential data.\n- **Potential Server Compromise:** The provided text indicates that this could lead to \"the ability to craft valid administrator sessions and take over the Pagure instance,\" which suggests that sensitive files like private keys or session data could be targeted.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Malicious Repository Creation:** A user with the ability to create or modify repositories within Pagure can insert malicious symbolic links within the repository.\n- **Archive Generation:** Triggering the `generate_archive()` function, possibly through a legitimate feature, will cause the vulnerable code to execute.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Pagure User Access:** The attacker needs to have an account on the Pagure instance and the ability to create or modify repositories.\n- **Triggering Archive Generation:** The attacker needs to be able to initiate the archive generation process.\n\n**Additional Information**\nThe bug report mentions:\n- The vulnerability is rated as \"high\" priority and severity.\n-  The fix is being tracked in related bugs [2315822](show_bug.cgi?id=2315822) and [2315823](show_bug.cgi?id=2315823)\n- A brief text states: \"A vulnerability was found in Pagure. Support of symbolic links during repository archiving of repositories allows the disclosure of local files. This flaw allows a malicious user to take advantage of the Pagure instance.\"\n- The description field states: \"Support of symbolic links during repository archiving of repositories allows the disclosure of local files. This results in the ability to craft valid administrator sessions and take over the Pagure instance.\"\n\nThis information is more detailed than the placeholder CVE description, providing a clear picture of the vulnerability's nature and potential impact.",

This could allow an attacker to cause the product to operate on unauthorized files.\n- CWE-22: The product uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the product does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.\n- CWE-41: The product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names. The associated manipulations are intended to generate multiple names for the same object.\n- CWE-538: The product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.",
