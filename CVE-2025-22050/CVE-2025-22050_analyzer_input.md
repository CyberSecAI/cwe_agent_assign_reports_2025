# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-22050

# Vulnerability Description

    In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved usbnetfix NPE during rx_complete **Missing usbnet_going_away Check in Critical Path**. The usb_submit_urb function lacks a usbnet_going_away validation, whereas __usbnet_queue_skb includes this check. This inconsistency creates a **race condition** where A URB request may succeed, but the corresponding SKB data fails to be queued. Subsequent processes (e.g., rx_complete defer_bh __skb_unlink(skb, list)) attempt to access skb->next, triggering a **NULL pointer dereference** (Kernel Panic).

    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.

    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'Missing usbnet_going_away Check in Critical Path'

Relevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:

### 1. CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference (Score: 414.96)

The product dereferences a pointer that it expects to be valid but is NULL....

### 2. CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') (Score: 386.70)

The product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently....

### 3. CWE-833: Deadlock (Score: 372.25)

The product contains multiple threads or executable segments that are waiting for each other to release a necessary lock, resulting in deadlock....

### 4. CWE-667: Improper Locking (Score: 363.27)

The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors....

### 5. CWE-252: Unchecked Return Value (Score: 344.39)

The product does not check the return value from a method or function, which can prevent it from detecting unexpected states and conditions....
