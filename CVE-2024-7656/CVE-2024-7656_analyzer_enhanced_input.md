# Vulnerability Description

    The Image Hotspot by DevVN plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to **PHP Object Injection** in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.5 via ****deserialization** of untrusted input** in the devvn_ihotspot_shortcode_func function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.
