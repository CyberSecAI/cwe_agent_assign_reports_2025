This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.', key_phrases={'rootcause': ['PHP Object Injection', 'deserialization of untrusted input'], 'weakness': 'deserialization', 'impact': ['Object Injection', 'delete arbitrary files', 'execute code', 'retrieve sensitive data'], 'vector': 'deserialization of untrusted input', 'attacker': 'authenticated attackers with Author-level access and above', 'product': 'Image Hotspot by DevVN plugin for WordPress', 'version': 'up to and including 1.2.5', 'component': 'devvn_ihotspot_shortcode_func function'}, reference_content='Based on the provided information, here\\'s a breakdown of the vulnerability:\\n\\n**Vulnerability:** PHP Object Injection\\n\\n**Root Cause:**\\nThe vulnerability stems from the insecure deserialization of user-supplied data within the `devvn_ihotspot_shortcode_func` function. Specifically, the plugin retrieves post content, and if it\\'s serialized, it uses `unserialize()` without proper sanitization or restrictions on allowed classes.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\\n- **Insecure Deserialization:** The core issue is the use of `unserialize()` on potentially malicious data.\\n- **Lack of Input Validation:** The plugin does not properly validate the data before passing it to `unserialize()`.\\n- **Missing `allowed_classes` parameter:** The original code uses `maybe_unserialize`, which was later changed to `unserialize` with `allowed_classes` set to `false`, to prevent arbitrary class instantiation.\\n\\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\\n- **PHP Object Injection:** An attacker can inject arbitrary PHP objects into the application.\\n- **Remote Code Execution (Potential):** If a suitable \"POP chain\" (a chain of classes with exploitable magic methods) exists within the WordPress installation (either in the vulnerable plugin itself, another installed plugin or theme), the attacker could potentially achieve arbitrary code execution, allowing them to:\\n  - Delete arbitrary files.\\n  - Retrieve sensitive data.\\n  - Execute arbitrary code on the server.\\n\\n**Attack Vectors:**\\n- The vulnerability is triggered through the `devvn_ihotspot_shortcode_func` function, which is called when the `[devvn_ihotspot]` shortcode is used in a post or page.\\n- The attacker injects malicious serialized data into the `post_content` field of a WordPress post.\\n\\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\\n- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to have at least \"Author\" level access to the WordPress site. This means the attacker must have the ability to create or modify posts and pages.\\n- **Knowledge of WordPress shortcodes:** The attacker must be aware that the `[devvn_ihotspot]` shortcode is available, and how it processes post data.\\n- **Knowledge of PHP Object Injection:** The attacker must be familiar with techniques to construct malicious serialized PHP objects.\\n- **Presence of a POP chain (for RCE):** For Remote Code Execution, the attacker needs a suitable POP chain in the WordPress installation.\\n\\n**Additional details from the provided content:**\\n- The vulnerability was patched in version 1.2.6 of the plugin.\\n- The patch involved using `unserialize()` with the `allowed_classes` option set to `false`, which restricts the instantiation of arbitrary objects.\\n- The `readme.txt` file explicitly mentions the addition of  `allowed_classes => false` to unserialize as suggested by a Wordfence analyst.', similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '',

    "enhanced_query": "# Vulnerability Description\n\n    The Image Hotspot by DevVN plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to **PHP Object Injection** in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.5 via ****deserialization** of untrusted input** in the devvn_ihotspot_shortcode_func function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'PHP Object Injection'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1.
