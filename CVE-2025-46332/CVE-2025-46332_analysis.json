  "description": "Flags SDK is an open-source feature flags toolkit for Next.js and SvelteKit. Impacted versions include flags from 3.2.0 and prior and @vercel/flags from 3.1.1 and prior as certain circumstances allows a bad actor with detailed knowledge of the vulnerability to list all flags returned by the flags discovery endpoint (.well-known/vercel/flags). This vulnerability allows for information disclosure, where a bad actor could gain access to a list of all feature flags exposed through the flags discovery endpoint, including the flag names, flag descriptions, available options and their labels (e.g. true, false), and default flag values. This issue has been patched in flags@4.0.0, users of flags and @vercel/flags should also migrate to flags@4.0.0.",

The vulnerability allowed a bad actor to list all flags returned by the flags discovery endpoint (`.well-known/vercel/flags`).\n\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities present:\nThe vulnerability allowed for information disclosure, where a bad actor could gain access to a list of all feature flags exposed through the flags discovery endpoint, including the:\n* Flag names\n* Flag descriptions\n* Available options and their labels (e.g. `true`, `false`)\n* Default flag values\n\nImpact of exploitation:\nInformation disclosure of feature flag details. Flags providers were not accessible. No write access nor additional customer data was exposed.\n\nAttack vectors:\nThe attack vector involves accessing the flags discovery endpoint (`.well-known/vercel/flags`). The vulnerability could be exploited if the attacker had detailed knowledge of the vulnerability.\n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position:\nA bad actor with detailed knowledge of the vulnerability.\n\nMitigation or fix:\nThe `verifyAccess` function was patched within `flags@4.0.0`. Users of `@vercel/flags` should also migrate to `flags@4.0.0`.\n\nVercel implemented a network-level mitigation to prevent the default flags discovery endpoint at `/.well-known/vercel/flags` being reachable.\n\nIf not protected by the Vercel default mitigation, temporarily deny access to the other exposed flags discovery endpoints through a custom WAF rule while you upgrade to the latest version.\n```",

While there might be more specific child CWEs, the provided evidence doesn't give enough technical indicators to support a more specific variant. No relevant chain or peer relationships significantly altered the decision. The abstraction level guided the selection to ensure that the chosen CWE was appropriately general, given the information available.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe200 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper handling** of the flags discovery endpoint, leading directly to the **exposure of sensitive information** (feature flags details). The chain is relatively short and direct, with the root cause being the accessibility of sensitive information without proper authorization.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the information disclosure through the flags discovery endpoint. The analysis and resulting conclusion are strongly based on the provided evidence, particularly from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary: \"The vulnerability allowed for information disclosure, where a bad actor could gain access to a list of all feature flags exposed through the flags discovery endpoint.\"\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the final selection by ensuring that a higher-level class was chosen because the evidence didn't point to a specific underlying cause, but clearly indicated information exposure.\n\nThe selected CWE, CWE-200, is at the optimal level of specificity because while more specific CWEs might exist, the provided evidence does not offer sufficient detail to confidently map to a lower-level CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product establishes a communication channel to (or from) an endpoint for privileged or protected operations, but it does not properly ensure that it is communicating with the correct endpoint.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-451: User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe user interface (UI) does not properly represent critical information to the user, allowing the information - or its source - to be obscured or spoofed.
