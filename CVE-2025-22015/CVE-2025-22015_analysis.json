  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved mm/migrate fix shmem xarray update during migration A shmem folio can be either in page cache or in swap cache, but not at the same time. Namely, once it is in swap cache, folio->mapping should be NULL, and the folio is no longer in a shmem mapping. In __folio_migrate_mapping(), to determine the number of xarray entries to update, folio_test_swapbacked() is used, but that **conflates shmem in page cache case and shmem in swap cache case**. It leads to **xarray multi-index entry corruption**, since it turns a sibling entry to a normal entry during xas_store() (see [1] for a userspace reproduction). Fix it by only using folio_test_swapcache() to determine whether xarray is storing swap cache entries or not to choose the right number of xarray entries to update. [1] https//lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/Z8idPCkaJW1IChjT@casper.infradead.org/ Note In __split_huge_page(), folio_test_anon() && folio_test_swapcache() is used to get swap_cache address space, but that ignores the shmem folio in swap cache case. It could lead to NULL pointer dereferencing when a in-swap-cache shmem folio is split at __xa_store(), since !folio_test_anon() is true and folio->mapping is NULL. But fortunately, its caller split_huge_page_to_list_to_order() bails out early with EBUSY when folio->mapping is NULL. So no need to take care of it here.",

The primary relationship considered was the direct identification of the **NULL pointer dereference** as the immediate cause of a crash. The relationship to `CWE-1251` was considered as a potential memory corruption issue. `CWE-617` could be triggered. Abstraction levels were considered to choose the most specific CWE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe476[\"CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference\"]\n    cwe1251[\"CWE-1251: Mirrored Regions with Different Values\"]\n    cwe617[\"CWE-617: Reachable Assertion\"]\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe476 primary\n    class cwe1251,cwe617 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an incorrect handling of shmem folios which **conflates shmem in page cache case and shmem in swap cache case**. This leads to **xarray multi-index entry corruption**. This corruption could then result in a **NULL pointer dereference** when the system attempts to access memory via a `NULL` mapping.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is a **NULL pointer dereference** (`CWE-476`). This is directly supported by the description: \"It could lead to **NULL pointer dereferencing** when a in-swap-cache shmem folio is split at __xa_store(), since !folio_test_anon() is true and folio->mapping is NULL.\"\n\n`CWE-1251` was considered because the root cause involves memory management issues and potential corruption due to the **conflation of shmem in page cache case and shmem in swap cache case**, which could lead to mirrored regions having different values.\n\n`CWE-617` was considered because the issue could potentially trigger an assertion failure.\n\nRelevant CWE
