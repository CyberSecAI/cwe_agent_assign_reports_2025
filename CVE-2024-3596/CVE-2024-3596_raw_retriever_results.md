# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-3596

# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-3596
## Query
RADIUS Protocol under RFC 2865 is susceptible to forgery attacks by a local attacker who can modify any valid Response (Access-Accept, Access-Reject, or Access-Challenge) to any other response using a chosen-prefix collision attack against MD5 Response Authenticator signature.

## Keyphrases
- **weakness**: 'chosen-prefix collision attack'
