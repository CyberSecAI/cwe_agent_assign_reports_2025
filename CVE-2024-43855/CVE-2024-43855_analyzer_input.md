# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-43855

## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved md fix deadlock between mddev_suspend and flush bio Deadlock occurs when mddev is being suspended while some flush bio is in progress. It is a complex issue. T1. the first flush is at the ending stage, it clears mddev->flush_bio and tries to submit data, but is blocked because mddev is suspended by T4. T2. the second flush sets mddev->flush_bio, and attempts to queue md_submit_flush_data(), which is already running (T1) and wont execute again if on the same CPU as T1. T3. the third flush inc active_io and tries to flush, but is blocked because mddev->flush_bio is not NULL (set by T2). T4. mddev_suspend() is called and waits for active_io dec to 0 which is inc by T3.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, this commit addresses a deadlock issue related to the md (Multiple Devices) driver in the Linux kernel, which is relevant to CVE-2024-43855.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability and its fix:

**Root Cause:**
The core issue is a non-atomic increment/decrement of the `active_io` counter during the flush process within the md driver. This counter is intended to track ongoing I/O operations. The problem lies in the timing of these operations with respect to the `mddev_suspend()` function which waits for active_io to reach zero.

**Vulnerability/Weakness:**
A race condition can occur when multiple flush requests are processed concurrently. Specifically:
1. A flush operation (`md_submit_flush_data`) might clear `mddev->flush_bio` and attempt to submit data.
2. Concurrently, another flush sets `mddev->flush_bio` and queues `md_submit_flush_data()`.
3. A third flush increments `active_io` and waits for `mddev->flush_bio` to be NULL.
4. Simultaneously, `mddev_suspend()` is called and waits for `active_io` to decrement to zero. Because the decrement was done before the work was queued, a deadlock occurs since T4 waits on active_io while T3 is waiting for mddev->flush_bio which will not be cleared until T1 is allowed to proceed by T4 finishing the suspend.

The issue arises from the fact that `active_io` is decremented *before* `md_submit_flush_data` is queued and incremented after it starts, instead of after all the related I/O has been completed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
The described scenario leads to a deadlock. The system becomes unresponsive, requiring a reboot. Specifically, the md device cannot be suspended.

**Attack Vectors:**
The vulnerability is triggered by a specific sequence of events:
1. Concurrent flush operations (multiple flush requests).
2. A request to suspend the md device (`mddev_suspend()`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker would need the ability to trigger multiple concurrent flush requests on a md device, and initiate a suspend operation on the md device.

**Fix:**
The patch modifies the timing of `active_io` decrement. The decrement is moved from `submit_flushes()` to `md_submit_flush_data()`, after the I/O has been handled (`md_handle_request`). The decrement is done after the `make_request()` call. This makes the active\_io counter behave as it should.

Additionally, the patch adds a WARN\_ON\_ONCE check to verify that `make_request()` does not return an error in this context, as it's not expected to. This is to prevent future regressions of the fix.

**Additional Notes:**
- The commit message explains the deadlock scenario and the fix in detail.
- The patch changes the location where the `percpu_ref_put(&mddev->active_io)` call is made.
- The patch includes a link to the original discussion on the kernel mailing list.

This detailed explanation provides a comprehensive understanding of the vulnerability and its fix.
