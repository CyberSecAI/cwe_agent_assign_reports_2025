Memory leak was detected with kmemleak ================================================================ unreferenced object 0xffff8880253cd680 (size 96) backtrace __kmalloc_node_track_caller_noprof (./include/linux/kmemleak.h43) kmemdup_noprof (mm/util.c136) ax25_rt_autobind (net/ax25/ax25_route.c428) ax25_connect (net/ax25/af_ax25.c1282) __sys_connect_file (net/socket.c2045) __sys_connect (net/socket.c2064) __x64_sys_connect (net/socket.c2067) do_syscall_64 (arch/x86/entry/common.c52 arch/x86/entry/common.c83) entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe (arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S130) ================================================================ When socket is bound, refcounts must be incremented the way it is done in ax25_bind() and ax25_setsockopt() (SO_BINDTODEVICE). In case of autobind, the refcounts are not incremented.

It is broken. autobinding in this may or may not work - it is better to completely remove this feature than to fix it because it is broken and leads to various kinds of memory bugs. Now calling connect() without first binding socket will result in an error (-EINVAL). Userspace software that relies on the autobind feature might get broken. However, this feature does not seem widely used with this specific driver as it was not reliable at any point of time, and it is already broken anyway. E.g. ax25-tools and ax25-apps packages for popular distributions do not use the autobind feature for AF_AX25. Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with Syzkaller.",
