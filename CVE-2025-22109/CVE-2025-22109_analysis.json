  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ax25 Remove broken autobind Binding AX25 socket by using the autobind feature leads to memory leaks in ax25_connect() and also refcount leaks in ax25_release().

In case of autobind, the refcounts are not incremented.

It is broken. autobinding in this may or may not work - it is better to completely remove this feature than to fix it because it is broken and leads to various kinds of memory bugs. Now calling connect() without first binding socket will result in an error (-EINVAL). Userspace software that relies on the autobind feature might get broken. However, this feature does not seem widely used with this specific driver as it was not reliable at any point of time, and it is already broken anyway. E.g. ax25-tools and ax25-apps packages for popular distributions do not use the autobind feature for AF_AX25. Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with Syzkaller.",

The **root cause** is the incorrect handling of reference counts during autobinding. |\n| CWE-401 | Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime | 0.7 | Variant | Allowed | Secondary CWE. Memory is allocated but not properly released due to the autobind feature, resulting in a memory leak. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary weakness is CWE-911, as the **improper updating of the reference count** leads directly to the memory leak. CWE-401 represents the impact of this **improper update**, specifically the **failure to release memory**. CWE-911 is a base CWE, providing a specific description of the reference count issue, while CWE-401 is a variant, detailing the memory leak consequence.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe911[\"CWE-911: Improper Update of Reference Count\"]\n    cwe401[\"CWE-401: Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime\"]\n\n    cwe401 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe911\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe911 primary\n    class cwe401 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper updating of reference counts** (CWE-911) during the autobinding process. This leads to resources not being properly tracked, ultimately resulting in the **missing release of memory** (CWE-401) and memory leaks.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis focuses on the **root cause** of the memory leak reported in the Linux kernel's ax25 implementation. The key evidence lies in the description stating that \"In case of autobind, the refcounts are not incremented.\" This indicates an **improper update of the reference count**, aligning perfectly with CWE-911. The subsequent memory leak is a direct consequence of this **improper update**, leading to the secondary mapping of CWE-401. The graph relationships helped visualize the progression from **improper reference counting to memory leak**, solidifying the selection of CWE-911 as the primary cause and CWE-401 as the result. Both CWEs are at appropriate levels of specificity.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this
