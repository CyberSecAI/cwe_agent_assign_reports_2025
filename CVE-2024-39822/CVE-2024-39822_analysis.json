The description clearly indicates **sensitive information exposure**, pointing towards CWE-200 as a strong candidate. However, the specificity of \"system information\" in CWE-497 could potentially make it a better fit if more details were provided. CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere) is a broader classification, but the authenticated user gaining access via network access suggests a resource (the sensitive information) is being exposed to the wrong entity.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe497[\"CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    \n    cwe497 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe668 -->|PEEROF| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe497,cwe668 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is relatively simple:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Sensitive information exposure** due to some unspecified weakness in Zoom products.\n2.  **Impact:** Information disclosure to an authenticated user via network access.\n\nThe chain highlights that the underlying cause is the **sensitive information exposure**, leading directly to the impact of information disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) as the most suitable primary CWE due to the prominent mention of **sensitive information exposure** in the vulnerability description.
