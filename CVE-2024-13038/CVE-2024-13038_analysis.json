  "description": "A vulnerability was found in CodeAstro Simple Loan Management System 1.0. It has been declared as critical. Affected by this vulnerability is an unknown functionality of the file /index.php of the component Login. The manipulation of the argument email leads to **sql injection**. The attack can be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n- The vulnerability is a Blind SQL Injection.\n- It occurs due to the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `email` parameter within the login functionality of the Simple Loan Management System.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Blind SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to blind SQL injection, meaning that the attacker cannot see the output of the query directly but can infer information by observing the application's behavior, such as time delays.\n- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The provided code snippet reveals that the `email` parameter, which is directly used in the SQL query, is not being sanitized or validated.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Information Disclosure:** Although blind, this SQL injection could be used to extract sensitive data from the database, potentially including user credentials, financial records, and other confidential information.\n- **Authentication Bypass:** An attacker might be able to manipulate the SQL query to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to the application.\n- **Data Manipulation:** With advanced exploitation, it may be possible to alter or delete the data in the database\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is performed through a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/index.php` endpoint, which handles the login process.\n- **Manipulated 'email' Parameter:** The primary attack vector is the `email` parameter in the POST request, where SQL injection payloads are injected.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the application's server.\n- **Basic Knowledge:** The attacker needs some knowledge of SQL and Blind SQL injection techniques.\n- **No Prior Authentication Required:** The vulnerability is located on a login page, therefore, an unauthenticated user can trigger the vulnerability.\n\n**Technical Details:**\n- The provided proof of concept uses a `SLEEP(7)` function to induce a time delay. This is a common technique to confirm the injection and extract data in a blind SQL injection scenario.\n- The vulnerable code snippet is:\n```php\n  $que=mysqli_query($conn,\"select * from admin where user='$email' and pass='$pass'\");\n```\n- The injection occurs in the `$email` variable.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The provided GitHub content includes a full HTTP request example that demonstrates how to exploit the vulnerability.\n- The affected application is the Simple Loan Management System, which can be found at the provided link on `codeastro.com`.\n- The vulnerability exists in `/index.php`.",
