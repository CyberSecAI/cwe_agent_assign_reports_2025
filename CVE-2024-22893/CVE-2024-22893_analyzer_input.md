# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-22893

## Vulnerability Description
OpenSlides 4.0.15 verifies passwords by comparing password hashes using a function with content-dependent runtime. This can allow attackers to obtain information about the password hash using a **timing attack**.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **OpenSlides verifies passwords by comparing password hashes using a function with content-dependent runtime**
- **weakness:** **timing attack**
- **impact:** obtain information about the password hash
- **attacker:** attackers
- **product:** OpenSlides
- **version:** 4.0.15

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

* **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the password verification process of OpenSlides 4.0.15. The function used to compare password hashes has a runtime that varies depending on the input, making it vulnerable to timing attacks.
* **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    * **Timing Attack:** The core weakness is the content-dependent runtime of the password hash comparison function. This allows an attacker to observe the time it takes for the system to respond to different password attempts.
* **Impact of Exploitation:**
    * **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can gather information about the password hash by analyzing the timing differences during failed login attempts, potentially leading to successful password cracking or other forms of unauthorized access.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Remote Attack:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely by sending multiple login attempts with varying password values.
* **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    * **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the OpenSlides instance.
    * **Authentication Interface Access:** The attacker must have access to the login or authentication interface.
    * **Ability to measure response times:** The attacker needs to be able to measure the time taken for login attempts to respond.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was reported to the vendor on 2023-Nov-19, and a fix was made available on 2023-Nov-23 in OpenSlides 4.0.16
- This was publicly disclosed on 2024-Sep-25
