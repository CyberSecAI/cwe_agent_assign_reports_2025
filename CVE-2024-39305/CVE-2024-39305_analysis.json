  "description": "Envoy is a cloud-native, open source edge and service proxy. Prior to versions 1.30.4, 1.29.7, 1.28.5, and 1.27.7. Envoy references already freed memory when route hash policy is configured with cookie attributes. Note that this vulnerability has been fixed in the open as the effect would be immediately apparent if it was configured. Memory allocated for holding attribute values is freed after configuration was parsed. During request processing Envoy will attempt to copy content of de-allocated memory into request cookie header. This can lead to arbitrary content of Envoys memory to be sent to the upstream service or abnormal process termination. This vulnerability is fixed in Envoy versions v1.30.4, v1.29.7, v1.28.5, and v1.27.7. As a workaround, do not use cookie attributes in route action hash policy.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-39305:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n- The vulnerability is a use-after-free. Memory allocated to hold cookie attribute values is freed after the configuration parsing phase. During request processing, Envoy attempts to copy the content of this de-allocated memory into the request cookie header.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- Use-after-free vulnerability (CWE-416). This occurs when the program attempts to access memory that has already been freed.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- **Information Disclosure:** Arbitrary content from Envoy's memory can be sent to the upstream service via the cookie header.\n- **Denial of Service:** The process may terminate abnormally, leading to a denial of service.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- A request from an untrusted peer. An attacker can trigger this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to a vulnerable Envoy instance.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Envoy instance. No specific privileges are required.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n- The vulnerability is triggered when the route hash policy is configured with cookie attributes.\n- The fix was developed in the open due to its easily noticeable impact.\n- The affected Envoy versions are v1.30.3, v1.29.6, v1.28.4, and v1.27.6.\n- Patched versions are v1.30.4, v1.29.7, v1.28.5, and v1.27.7.\n- A workaround involves not using cookie attributes in the route action hash policy.\n- Detection can be done by observing unexpected characters in the cookie header at the upstream service or via abnormal process termination with route hash policy methods in the stack trace.",

After the memory is freed, the program attempts to write to it, leading to a write-what-where condition (CWE-123). Because the data is sent to the upstream service it can lead to sensitive information being sent (CWE-201).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary **rootcause** of this vulnerability is a **use-after-free** condition. The CVE description and the CVE reference links content summary both explicitly state this. The vulnerability occurs when Envoy attempts to copy the content of de-allocated memory into a request cookie header. The most accurate CWE for this is CWE-416 Use After Free, which is a Variant level CWE. The evidence from the CVE description is: \"Envoy references already freed memory\" and from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary is: \"The vulnerability is a use-after-free. Memory allocated to hold cookie attribute values is freed after the configuration parsing phase. During request processing, Envoy attempts to copy the content of this de-allocated memory into the request cookie header.\"\n\nCWE-123 (Write-what-where Condition) is considered as a secondary CWE because it could happen as a result of the use-after-free. After the memory is freed, the program attempts to write to it, leading to a write-what-where condition.\n\nCWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data) is considered as a secondary CWE because Envoy's memory is sent to the upstream service. The evidence from the CVE description is: \"This can lead to arbitrary content of Envoys memory to be sent to the upstream service\".\n\nOther CWEs Considered and Rejected:\n\n*   CWE-784 Reliance on Cookies without Validation and Integrity Checking in a Security Decision: While the vulnerability involves cookies, the root cause is not related to cookie validation or integrity checking.\n*   CWE-212 Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer: The vulnerability is not about the improper removal of sensitive information before storage or transfer, but rather about accessing memory that has already been freed.\n*   CWE-346 Origin Validation Error: The vulnerability does not involve origin validation.\n*   CWE-941 Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel: The vulnerability does not involve incorrect communication channel destination.\n*   CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection'): The vulnerability is not related to injection.\n*   CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF): The vulnerability does not involve server-side request forgery.\n*   CWE-843 Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion'): The vulnerability is not related to type confusion.\n*   CWE-755 Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions: The vulnerability is not primarily about improper handling of exceptional conditions.\n*   CWE-617 Reachable Assertion: The vulnerability does not involve reachable assertions.\n*   CWE-789 Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value: The vulnerability is not about memory allocation with excessive size.\n*   CWE-190 Integer Overflow or Wraparound: The vulnerability is not related to integer overflow or wraparound.\n*   CWE-362 Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition'): The vulnerability does not involve race conditions.\n*   CWE-327 Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm: The vulnerability does not involve cryptography.\n*   CWE-674 Uncontrolled Recursion: The vulnerability is not related to uncontrolled recursion.\n*   CWE-287 Improper Authentication: The vulnerability is not related to authentication.\n*   CWE-128 Wrap-around Error: The vulnerability is not related to wrap-around errors.\n*   CWE-201 Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data: While sensitive information might be leaked, the primary issue is the use-after-free.\n*   CWE-364 Signal Handler Race Condition: The vulnerability is not related to signal handler race conditions.\n*   CWE-226 Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse: The vulnerability is not related to sensitive information not being removed before reuse.\n*   CWE-1339 Insufficient Precision or Accuracy of a Real Number: The vulnerability is not related to real number precision.",
