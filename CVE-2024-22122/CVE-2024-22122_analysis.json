  "description": "Zabbix allows to configure SMS notifications. AT **command injection** occurs on Zabbix Server because there is **no validation of Number field** on Web nor on Zabbix server side. Attacker can run test of SMS providing specially crafted phone number and execute additional AT commands on modem.",

  },
  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n- The vulnerability stems from a lack of input validation on the \"Number\" field used for configuring SMS notifications within Zabbix. Specifically, neither the web frontend nor the Zabbix server validate this field, allowing for the injection of arbitrary AT commands.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n- **Command Injection (CWE-77):** Malicious AT commands can be injected into the \"Number\" field.\n- The lack of input validation allows for the injection of special elements used in a command\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **AT Command Injection:** An attacker can execute arbitrary AT commands on the GSM modem connected to the Zabbix server.\n- **Varying Impact:** The impact varies depending on the modem's manufacturer and capabilities.\n- **Potentially Severe:** In a worst-case scenario, a modem may allow for FTP connections, which could be exploited to update the modem's firmware. This could lead to remote code execution (RCE), Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), etc.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- The attacker crafts a specially crafted phone number containing malicious AT commands.\n- The attacker uses the Zabbix web frontend or possibly a direct request to the Zabbix server to submit the crafted number when testing SMS notifications.\n- The injected AT commands are then executed on the GSM modem when the Zabbix server sends an SMS test using this number.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- The attacker needs to have access to the Zabbix web interface or be able to communicate directly with the Zabbix server.\n- The attacker requires the ability to configure SMS notifications within Zabbix and to provide a custom phone number for SMS testing.\n- The attacker would likely need some knowledge of AT commands.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n- **CVSS Score:** 3.0 (Low Severity)\n- **CVSS Vector:** AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N (Network access, High attack complexity, High privileges, No user interaction required, Scope changed, No confidentiality impact, Low integrity impact, No availability impact)\n- **Affected Versions:** 5.0.42, 6.0.30, 6.4.15, 7.0.0rc2\n- **Fixed Versions:** 5.0.43rc1, 6.0.31rc1, 6.4.16rc1, 7.0.0rc3\n- **Components Affected:** Frontend and Server\n- **Mitigation:** Upgrade Zabbix Server and Frontend to patched versions.\n\nThis content provides more details than the typical CVE description, particularly regarding the specific attack vector, affected components and versions, and the range of potential impacts based on modem functionality.",

CWE-78 also has a peer relationship with CWE-88 (Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')), suggesting a potential alternative classification if the injection occurred through argument delimiters. However, since the description specifically mentions AT **command injection**, CWE-78 is a more accurate fit. CWE-20 is too general and is discouraged.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    \n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe20 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe78\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe20 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **no validation of Number field**, leading to **command injection**, which allows an attacker to execute AT commands on the modem.\n  - **Root Cause:** Lack of input validation (**no validation of Number field**)\n  - **Weakness:** Improper neutralization of special elements used in a command (CWE-78)\n  - **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary AT commands on the modem\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment based on the provided evidence strongly points to CWE-78 as the primary weakness. The vulnerability description clearly states that the root cause is the lack of input validation on the \"Number\" field, which enables **command injection**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary further corroborates this by highlighting the ability to inject malicious AT commands due to the absence of input validation. The chain of events is clear: missing input validation leads to command injection, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary commands.\n\nCWE-20 was considered but ultimately deemed too general. While **improper input validation** is the root cause, CWE-78 more precisely describes the type of vulnerability that arises from this lack of validation.\n\nThe decision to select CWE-78 is based on the detailed description of the vulnerability, the supporting evidence from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, and the hierarchical relationship between CWE-78 and its parent CWE-74. This selection provides the most accurate and specific representation of the weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-790: Improper Filtering of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives data from an upstream component, but does not filter or incorrectly filters special elements before sending it to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n*Not Used*: CWE-78 is a child of CWE-74 which is a child of CWE-138 which is a child of CWE-790, but CWE-78 is a better fit.\n\n## CWE-93: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses CRLF (carriage return line feeds) as a special element, e.g. to separate lines or records, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CRLF sequences from inputs.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n*Not Used*: This vulnerability is not specific to CRLF injection.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n*Not Used*: CWE-78 is a child of this Class, and is a better fit.\n\n## CWE-134: Use of Externally-Controlled Format String\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a function that accepts a format string as an argument, but the format string originates from an external source.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n*Not Used*: This vulnerability is not related to format string injection.\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n*Not Used*: This vulnerability is not related to information exposure.\n\n## CWE-290: Authentication Bypass by Spoofing\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThis attack-focused weakness is caused by incorrectly implemented authentication schemes that are subject to spoofing attacks.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n*Not Used*: This vulnerability is not related to authentication bypass.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
