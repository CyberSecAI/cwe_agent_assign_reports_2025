## Vulnerability Description
IrfanView DXF File Parsing Memory Corruption Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of IrfanView. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of DXF files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a **memory corruption** condition. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-24807.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing DXF files within IrfanView. This inadequate validation leads to a memory corruption condition.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary weakness is insufficient input validation during the parsing of DXF files. This allows for a memory corruption vulnerability to occur.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process running IrfanView. This can lead to complete system compromise.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector involves user interaction. The target must either visit a malicious webpage or open a malicious DXF file.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to deliver a specially crafted DXF file to a user of IrfanView, either via a webpage or as a direct file to be opened. They do not require any special access on the target machine before the exploit.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was reported to the vendor on 2024-07-24 and publicly disclosed on 2024-11-21.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in IrfanView version 4.70 with plugins version 4.70.
