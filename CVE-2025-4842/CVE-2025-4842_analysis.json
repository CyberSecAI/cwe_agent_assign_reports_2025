  "description": "A vulnerability was found in D-Link DCS-932L 2.18.01. It has been declared as critical. This vulnerability affects the function isUCPCameraNameChanged of the file /sbin/ucp. The manipulation of the argument CameraName leads to stack-based buffer overflow. The attack can be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer.",

This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-119 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available.\n\n*Not Selected*: While a buffer overflow is involved, the description specifically mentions \"stack-based,\" making the more specific CWE-121 a better fit.
