## Vulnerability Description
The Advanced Floating Content plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to **SQL Injection** via the floating_content_duplicate_post function in all versions up to, and including, 3.8.2 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.
