# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-27794

## Vulnerability Description
Flarum is open-source forum software. A session hijacking vulnerability exists in versions prior to 1.8.10 when an attacker-controlled authoritative subdomain under a parent domain (e.g., `subdomain.host.com`) sets cookies scoped to the parent domain (`.host.com`). This allows session token replacement for applications hosted on sibling subdomains (e.g., `community.host.com`) if session tokens arent rotated post-authentication. Key Constraints are that the attacker must control any subdomain under the parent domain (e.g., `evil.host.com` or `x.y.host.com`), and the parent domain must not be on the Public Suffix List. Due to **non-existent session token rotation after authenticating** we can theoretically reproduce the vulnerability by using browser dev tools, but due to the browsers security measures this does not seem to be exploitable as described. Version 1.8.10 contains a patch for the issue.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-27794 related content

Here's an analysis of the provided content, focusing on relevance to CVE-2025-27794, and extracting key information.

**1. Relevance Verification:**

The content directly addresses a session hijacking vulnerability in the Flarum framework, matching the CVE description's focus on session hijacking. The CVE ID (CVE-2025-27794) is also explicitly mentioned in the security advisory.

**2. Extracted Information:**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** An attacker-controlled authoritative subdomain can overwrite cookies scoped to the parent domain, allowing session token replacement. This is possible when session tokens are not rotated after authentication.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   Lack of session token rotation after authentication.
    *   Cookie scoping vulnerabilities allowing subdomain cookie overwrite to the parent domain.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Account takeover, data exposure (email, private messages, etc.).
*   **Attack vectors:**
    1.  Attacker hosts a server on an authoritative subdomain of the target domain (e.g., `evil.host.com`).
    2.  Attacker obtains a valid session token from the target domain (e.g., `community.host.com`).
    3.  Victim visits the attacker's subdomain.
    4.  Attacker's server sets a cookie with the stolen token, scoped to the parent domain.
    5.  Victim's subsequent requests to the target domain use the attacker's token, resulting in session hijacking.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   Control over an authoritative subdomain of the target domain.
    *   Ability to set cookies on the parent domain.
    *   The parent domain must *not* be on the Public Suffix List (PSL).
*   **Mitigation or fix:**
    1.  **Session Token Rotation:** Invalidate and regenerate session tokens after authentication.
    2.  **Cookie Scoping:** Restrict cookies to explicit subdomains (e.g., `Domain=community.host.com`).
    3.  **Public Suffix Registration:** Add the parent domain to the Public Suffix List.
*   **Patched versions:** 1.8.10
*   **Affected versions:** < 1.8.10
*   **CVSS:** 6.8/10 (Moderate)
    *   AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N

**3. Additional Details:**

*   The content provides more detail than the placeholder CVE description. It includes a proof-of-concept (Deno code), explains why reverse DNS subdomains fail, and details browser security behavior related to cookie handling.
*   The commit `a05aaea` includes a change to invalidate and regenerate the session token when a new token is detected, addressing the vulnerability.
*   The advisory clarifies the conditions under which the vulnerability is exploitable, specifically the requirement for the parent domain not to be on the Public Suffix List.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control

**Authentication**:
Determines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.

* Example phrases: "user must log in", "lack of login check", "bypasses login"
* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.

  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* – used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).

**Authorization**:
Determines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do. It decides access *after* identity is verified.

* Example phrases: "unauthorized access", "regular user can access admin panel", "role checks are missing"
* CWE relevance: use CWEs like 862, 863, 285 for authorization errors:

  * **CWE-862**: *Missing Authorization* – the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all.
  * **CWE-863**: *Incorrect Authorization* – the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).
  * **CWE-285**: *Improper Authorization* – general category for any flawed authorization logic or design.

**Access Control**:
A broader term that includes both authentication and authorization. Governs how resources are protected and who can access them under what conditions.

* CWE relevance:

  * **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* – top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear.
  * This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.

## Mapping Discussion – Common Misclassification Patterns

### 1. **CWE-306 vs CWE-862**:

* **306** is about lack of **authentication** (e.g., *no login required at all*).
* **862** is about lack of **authorization** *after* authentication (e.g., *admin check missing*).
* ✅ Example CWE-306: *“An unauthenticated attacker can invoke the password reset API.”*
* ✅ Example CWE-862: *“An authenticated user without admin privileges can delete any user account.”*

### 2. **CWE-285 vs CWE-284**:

* **285** is specific to authorization flaws – it's a better choice than 284 **if** the issue involves *improper or missing role checks*.
* **284** should be reserved for general access control issues when it’s unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.

---

## Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification

**Phrase like "unauthorized access" is not enough.**

* If you **cannot determine whether identity was checked**, assume it’s **authorization** and consider 862 or 863.
* If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** → CWE-306.
* If the **access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced**, but it's not due to missing checks, consider **CWE-284**.

---

## Good Mapping Examples

* ✅ **CWE-306**: “The endpoint `/admin/deleteUser` does not require any authentication.”
* ✅ **CWE-862**: “Any logged-in user can change any other user's email without being an admin.”
* ✅ **CWE-863**: “An admin check exists but incorrectly grants access to non-admin users.”
* ✅ **CWE-285**: “Application uses a static role check that fails when roles change dynamically.”
* ✅ **CWE-284**: “Inconsistent enforcement of access rules across services with unclear policy source.”
