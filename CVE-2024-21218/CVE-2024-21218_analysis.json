This is supported by the information provided in the vulnerability description. The secondary CWE, CWE-770, was considered due to the impact of the vulnerability, which is a denial of service (DOS). CWE-770 is related to resource allocation without limits, which can lead to DOS. However, the evidence is insufficient to confirm this relationship.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cweNVD[\"CWE-NVD-noinfo\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    cwe400 -->|RELATED| cweNVD\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cweNVD primary\n    class cwe770 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an unspecified weakness in the InnoDB component. The **impact** is a hang or crash of the MySQL server, leading to a denial of service. Due to the lack of information, it is difficult to determine any intermediate steps in the chain.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary assessment is heavily based on the provided evidence. The vulnerability description lacks specific details about the root cause, leading to the assignment of CWE-NVD-noinfo.\n\nThe \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" states: \"The root cause of the vulnerability lies in an unspecified weakness within the InnoDB component\". This lack of specificity is why CWE-NVD-noinfo is the primary mapping.\n\nCWE-770 was considered due to the denial-of-service impact. However, without more information about the root cause, it is difficult to confirm this relationship. Therefore, CWE-770 is listed as a secondary candidate.\n\nThe relationship graph influenced the selection by highlighting potential connections between the impact and possible root causes. However, the lack of specific information limited the ability to make strong assertions.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the appropriate level of specificity given the available information. CWE-NVD-noinfo is used when there's not enough information to assign a more specific CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component. Without sufficient removal or quoting of SQL syntax in user-controllable inputs, the generated SQL query can cause those inputs to be interpreted as SQL instead of ordinary user data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-129: Improper Validation of Array Index\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses untrusted input when calculating or using an array index, but the product does not validate or incorrectly validates the index to ensure the index references a valid position within the array.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product generates an error message that includes sensitive information about its environment, users, or associated data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).

This is supported by the information provided in the vulnerability description. The secondary CWE, CWE-770, was considered due to the impact of the vulnerability, which is a denial of service (DOS). CWE-770 is related to resource allocation without limits, which can lead to DOS. However, the evidence is insufficient to confirm this relationship.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cweNVD[\"CWE-NVD-noinfo\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    cwe400 -->|RELATED| cweNVD\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cweNVD primary\n    class cwe770 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an unspecified weakness in the InnoDB component. The **impact** is a hang or crash of the MySQL server, leading to a denial of service. Due to the lack of information, it is difficult to determine any intermediate steps in the chain.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary assessment is heavily based on the provided evidence. The vulnerability description lacks specific details about the root cause, leading to the assignment of CWE-NVD-noinfo.\n\nThe \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" states: \"The root cause of the vulnerability lies in an unspecified weakness within the InnoDB component\". This lack of specificity is why CWE-NVD-noinfo is the primary mapping.\n\nCWE-770 was considered due to the denial-of-service impact. However, without more information about the root cause, it is difficult to confirm this relationship. Therefore, CWE-770 is listed as a secondary candidate.\n\nThe relationship graph influenced the selection by highlighting potential connections between the impact and possible root causes. However, the lack of specific information limited the ability to make strong assertions.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the appropriate level of specificity given the available information. CWE-NVD-noinfo is used when there's not enough information to assign a more specific CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.
