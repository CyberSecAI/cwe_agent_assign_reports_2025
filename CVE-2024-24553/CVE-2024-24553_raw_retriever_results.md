# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-24553

# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-24553
## Query
Bludit uses the SHA-1 hashing algorithm to compute password hashes. Thus, attackers could determine cleartext passwords with brute-force attacks due to the inherent speed of SHA-1. In addition, the salt that is computed by Bludit is generated with a non-cryptographically secure function.

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: 'Bludit uses the SHA-1 hashing algorithm to compute password hashes'
