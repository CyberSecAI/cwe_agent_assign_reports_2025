CWE-256 is a more specific case of CWE-522, and since the vulnerability description explicitly states that the credentials are stored in plaintext, CWE-256 is the more appropriate choice.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe256[\"CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    \n    cwe256 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe256 primary\n    class cwe522 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is simple:\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Plaintext Storage of User Credentials** (CWE-256)\n2.  **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the router and potential data compromise.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The description clearly states that user credentials are stored in plaintext within the router's firmware. This aligns directly with the definition of CWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password).\n\nThe Retriever Results also highlighted CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information) and CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials). However, CWE-256 is a more specific case of both of these, making it the most appropriate choice.\n\nThe relationship analysis confirmed that CWE-256 is a child of CWE-522, providing further support for the selection of CWE-256 as the primary CWE.
