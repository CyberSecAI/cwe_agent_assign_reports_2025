### 5. CWE-1299: Missing Protection Mechanism for Alternate Hardware Interface (Score: 102.82)

The lack of protections on alternate paths to access
                control-protected assets (such as unprotected shadow registers
                and other external facing unguarded interfaces) allows an
                attacker to bypass existing protections to the asset that are
		only performed...
