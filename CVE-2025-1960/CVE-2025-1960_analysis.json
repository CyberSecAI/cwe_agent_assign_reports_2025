This influenced the choice of CWE-1188 as the primary because it's at a lower level of abstraction, which is preferred.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1188[\"CWE-1188: Initialization of a Resource with an Insecure Default\"]\n    cwe1391[\"CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\"]\n    \n    cwe1188 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1391\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe1188 primary\n    class cwe1391 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **CWE-1188 Initialization of a Resource with an Insecure Default** where a **default password** is set. If the user fails to change this **default password**, it leads to a **Use of Weak Credentials** (CWE-1391), and can allow an **attacker** to **execute unauthorized commands**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, specifically the vulnerability description and the keyphrase analysis. The vulnerability is primarily due to the **Initialization of a Resource with an Insecure Default** (CWE-1188), specifically a **default password**. The graph relationships influenced the decision because CWE-1188 is more specific than CWE-1391, making it a better fit as the primary CWE.
