  "description": "A vulnerability classified as problematic was found in Netis WF-2404 1.1.124EN. Affected by this vulnerability is an unknown functionality of the component BusyBox Shell. The manipulation leads to **cleartext storage of sensitive information**. It is possible to launch the attack on the physical device. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation appears to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",

  "reference_content": "The content relates to potential vulnerabilities in the Netis WF-2404 router. It details a method to change the default credentials via a UART shell and the `flash` command.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe root cause is the presence of a UART shell running with root privileges without authentication, combined with a hidden `flash` command that allows direct modification of sensitive parameters.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n*   Unauthenticated UART shell access with root privileges.\n*   Hidden `flash` command allowing modification of persistent parameters.\n*   Default credentials are easily crackable and publicly known.\n*   Lack of password hashing (passwords stored in cleartext).\n*   Lack of physical security hardening.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\nAn attacker can gain full control of the router by changing credentials, potentially allowing for remote access and further exploitation. The `flash` command provides a direct avenue for payload testing and modification of firmware parameters.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n*   Physical access to the router.\n*   Connection to the UART interface.\n*   Use of the `flash` command to modify credentials.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n*   Physical access to the router.\n*   Ability to connect to and interact with the UART interface (requires soldering skills and appropriate hardware).\n*   Knowledge of the `flash` command and its parameters.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n*   Implement authentication for the UART shell.\n*   Remove or restrict access to the `flash` command.\n*   Hash passwords instead of storing them in cleartext.\n*   Implement physical security measures to prevent unauthorized access to the UART interface.\n\n**Note:** This content provides more detail than a typical CVE description, detailing the specific steps and commands used to exploit the vulnerability.",

CWE-306 is a related weakness because the **missing authentication** on the UART shell allows attackers to access and exploit the **cleartext storage**. CWE-912 is included because the hidden flash command is how the **cleartext storage** is modified.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe912[\"CWE-912: Hidden Functionality\"]\n    \n    cwe312 -- Allows Modification --> cwe306\n    cwe912 -- Modifies --> cwe312\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe312 primary\n    class cwe306,cwe912 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n1.  **Missing Authentication (CWE-306)** on the UART shell.\n2.  **Hidden Functionality (CWE-912)** via the `flash` command.\n3.  **Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information (CWE-312)**, allowing modification of sensitive parameters.\n\nThe chain starts with the **missing authentication**, which permits access to the hidden functionality. This hidden functionality then allows an attacker to modify the parameters that are stored in **cleartext**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is the **cleartext storage of sensitive information (CWE-312)**, as directly stated in the vulnerability description: \"The manipulation leads to **cleartext storage of sensitive information**.\" The presence of an unauthenticated UART shell (CWE-306) and a hidden `flash` command (CWE-912) contributes to the exploitability of this weakness. The description explicitly states: \"Unauthenticated UART shell access with root privileges,\" and \"Hidden `flash` command allowing modification of persistent parameters.\"\n\nThe selection of CWE-312 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability. While other CWEs like CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information) and CWE-532 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File) were considered, they were less relevant as the primary

        "extended_description": "\n\nThis weakness can lead to a vulnerability in environments in which the attacker does not have direct access to the operating system, such as in web applications. Alternately, if the weakness occurs in a privileged program, it could allow the attacker to specify commands that normally would not be accessible, or to call alternate commands with privileges that the attacker does not have. The problem is exacerbated if the compromised process does not follow the principle of least privilege, because the attacker-controlled commands may run with special system privileges that increases the amount of damage.\n\n\nThere are at least two subtypes of OS command injection:\n\n\n  - The application intends to execute a single, fixed program that is under its own control. It intends to use externally-supplied inputs as arguments to that program. For example, the program might use system(\"nslookup [HOSTNAME]\") to run nslookup and allow the user to supply a HOSTNAME, which is used as an argument. Attackers cannot prevent nslookup from executing. However, if the program does not remove command separators from the HOSTNAME argument, attackers could place the separators into the arguments, which allows them to execute their own program after nslookup has finished executing.\n\n  - The application accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run, as well as which commands to use. The application simply redirects this entire command to the operating system. For example, the program might use \"exec([COMMAND])\" to execute the [COMMAND] that was supplied by the user. If the COMMAND is under attacker control, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or programs. If the command is being executed using functions like exec() and CreateProcess(), the attacker might not be able to combine multiple commands together in the same line.\n\nFrom a weakness standpoint, these variants represent distinct programmer errors. In the first variant, the programmer clearly intends that input from untrusted parties will be part of the arguments in the command to be executed. In the second variant, the programmer does not intend for the command to be accessible to any untrusted party, but the programmer probably has not accounted for alternate ways in which malicious attackers can provide input.",
