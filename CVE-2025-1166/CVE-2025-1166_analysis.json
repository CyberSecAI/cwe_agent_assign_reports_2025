This allows bypassing image type detection.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- Insufficient file type validation.\n- Reliance on `getimagesize()` for file type detection, which can be bypassed.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- Upload of malicious Trojan files.\n- Potential for remote code execution (RCE) via PHP code execution.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- Uploading a GIF89a file containing malicious PHP code.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- Ability to upload files to the server.\n- Knowledge of PHP and GIF89a format.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\nThe content does not provide a specific fix, but implies stronger file type validation is needed beyond `getimagesize()`.\n\nThe content provides more detail than a typical CVE description, including a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit.",
