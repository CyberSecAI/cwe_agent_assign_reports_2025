# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.

### Extended Description


This weakness can lead to a vulnerability in environments in which the attacker does not have direct access to the operating system, such as in web applications. Alternately, if the weakness occurs in a privileged program, it could allow the attacker to specify commands that normally would not be accessible, or to call alternate commands with privileges that the attacker does not have. The problem is exacerbated if the compromised process does not follow the principle of least privilege, because the attacker-controlled commands may run with special system privileges that increases the amount of damage.


There are at least two subtypes of OS command injection:


  - The application intends to execute a single, fixed program that is under its own control. It intends to use externally-supplied inputs as arguments to that program. For example, the program might use system("nslookup [HOSTNAME]") to run nslookup and allow the user to supply a HOSTNAME, which is used as an argument. Attackers cannot prevent nslookup from executing. However, if the program does not remove command separators from the HOSTNAME argument, attackers could place the separators into the arguments, which allows them to execute their own program after nslookup has finished executing.

  - The application accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run, as well as which commands to use. The application simply redirects this entire command to the operating system. For example, the program might use "exec([COMMAND])" to execute the [COMMAND] that was supplied by the user. If the COMMAND is under attacker control, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or programs. If the command is being executed using functions like exec() and CreateProcess(), the attacker might not be able to combine multiple commands together in the same line.

From a weakness standpoint, these variants represent distinct programmer errors. In the first variant, the programmer clearly intends that input from untrusted parties will be part of the arguments in the command to be executed. In the second variant, the programmer does not intend for the command to be accessible to any untrusted party, but the programmer probably has not accounted for alternate ways in which malicious attackers can provide input.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Terminology]** The "OS command injection" phrase carries different meanings to different people. For some people, it only refers to cases in which the attacker injects command separators into arguments for an application-controlled program that is being invoked. For some people, it refers to any type of attack that can allow the attacker to execute OS commands of their own choosing. This usage could include untrusted search path weaknesses (CWE-426) that cause the application to find and execute an attacker-controlled program. Further complicating the issue is the case when argument injection (CWE-88) allows alternate command-line switches or options to be inserted into the command line, such as an "-exec" switch whose purpose may be to execute the subsequent argument as a command (this -exec switch exists in the UNIX "find" command, for example). In this latter case, however, CWE-88 could be regarded as the primary weakness in a chain with CWE-78.

**[Research Gap]** More investigation is needed into the distinction between the OS command injection variants, including the role with argument injection (CWE-88). Equivalent distinctions may exist in other injection-related problems such as SQL injection.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2020-10987:** OS command injection in Wi-Fi router, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2020-10221:** Template functionality in network configuration management tool allows OS command injection, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2020-9054:** Chain: improper input validation (CWE-20) in username parameter, leading to OS command injection (CWE-78), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.




## CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
A stack-based buffer overflow condition is a condition where the buffer being overwritten is allocated on the stack (i.e., is a local variable or, rarely, a parameter to a function).

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Stack Overflow: "Stack Overflow" is often used to mean the same thing as stack-based buffer overflow, however it is also used on occasion to mean stack exhaustion, usually a result from an excessively recursive function call. Due to the ambiguity of the term, use of stack overflow to describe either circumstance is discouraged.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-788

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**

### Additional Notes
**[Other]** Stack-based buffer overflows can instantiate in return address overwrites, stack pointer overwrites or frame pointer overwrites. They can also be considered function pointer overwrites, array indexer overwrites or write-what-where condition, etc.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-35395:** Stack-based buffer overflows in SFK for wifi chipset used for IoT/embedded devices, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.




## CWE-284: Improper Access Control
**Abstraction:** Pillar
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product does not restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor.

### Extended Description


Access control involves the use of several protection mechanisms such as:


  - Authentication (proving the identity of an actor)

  - Authorization (ensuring that a given actor can access a resource), and

  - Accountability (tracking of activities that were performed)

When any mechanism is not applied or otherwise fails, attackers can compromise the security of the product by gaining privileges, reading sensitive information, executing commands, evading detection, etc.

There are two distinct behaviors that can introduce access control weaknesses:


  - Specification: incorrect privileges, permissions, ownership, etc. are explicitly specified for either the user or the resource (for example, setting a password file to be world-writable, or giving administrator capabilities to a guest user). This action could be performed by the program or the administrator.

  - Enforcement: the mechanism contains errors that prevent it from properly enforcing the specified access control requirements (e.g., allowing the user to specify their own privileges, or allowing a syntactically-incorrect ACL to produce insecure settings). This problem occurs within the program itself, in that it does not actually enforce the intended security policy that the administrator specifies.



### Alternative Terms
Authorization: The terms "access control" and "authorization" are often used interchangeably, although many people have distinct definitions. The CWE usage of "access control" is intended as a general term for the various mechanisms that restrict which users can access which resources, and "authorization" is more narrowly defined. It is unlikely that there will be community consensus on the use of these terms.

### Relationships
None

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-284 is extremely high-level, a Pillar. Its name, "Improper Access Control," is often misused in low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287] or by active use of the OWASP Top Ten, such as "A01:2021-Broken Access Control". It is not useful for trend analysis.
**Comments:** Consider using descendants of CWE-284 that are more specific to the kind of access control involved, such as those involving authorization (Missing Authorization (CWE-862), Incorrect Authorization (CWE-863), Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource (CWE-732), etc.); authentication (Missing Authentication (CWE-306) or Weak Authentication (CWE-1390)); Incorrect User Management (CWE-286); Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints (CWE-923); etc.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse
- Abstraction
**Suggested Alternatives:**
- CWE-862: Missing Authorization
- CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization
- CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource
- CWE-306: Missing Authentication
- CWE-1390: Weak Authentication
- CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** 

This entry needs more work. Possible sub-categories include:


  - Trusted group includes undesired entities (partially covered by CWE-286)

  - Group can perform undesired actions

  - ACL parse error does not fail closed





### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-24985:** A form hosting website only checks the session authentication status for a single form, making it possible to bypass authentication when there are multiple forms
- **CVE-2022-29238:** Access-control setting in web-based document collaboration tool is not properly implemented by the code, which prevents listing hidden directories but does not prevent direct requests to files in those directories.
- **CVE-2022-23607:** Python-based HTTP library did not scope cookies to a particular domain such that "supercookies" could be sent to any domain on redirect




## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.

### Extended Description


Improper encoding or escaping can allow attackers to change the commands that are sent to another component, inserting malicious commands instead.


Most products follow a certain protocol that uses structured messages for communication between components, such as queries or commands. These structured messages can contain raw data interspersed with metadata or control information. For example, "GET /index.html HTTP/1.1" is a structured message containing a command ("GET") with a single argument ("/index.html") and metadata about which protocol version is being used ("HTTP/1.1").


If an application uses attacker-supplied inputs to construct a structured message without properly encoding or escaping, then the attacker could insert special characters that will cause the data to be interpreted as control information or metadata. Consequently, the component that receives the output will perform the wrong operations, or otherwise interpret the data incorrectly.


### Alternative Terms
Output Sanitization
Output Validation
Output Encoding

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-707
CanPrecede -> CWE-74

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This weakness is primary to all weaknesses related to injection (CWE-74) since the inherent nature of injection involves the violation of structured messages.

**[Relationship]** 

CWE-116 and CWE-20 have a close association because, depending on the nature of the structured message, proper input validation can indirectly prevent special characters from changing the meaning of a structured message. For example, by validating that a numeric ID field should only contain the 0-9 characters, the programmer effectively prevents injection attacks.


However, input validation is not always sufficient, especially when less stringent data types must be supported, such as free-form text. Consider a SQL injection scenario in which a last name is inserted into a query. The name "O'Reilly" would likely pass the validation step since it is a common last name in the English language. However, it cannot be directly inserted into the database because it contains the "'" apostrophe character, which would need to be escaped or otherwise neutralized. In this case, stripping the apostrophe might reduce the risk of SQL injection, but it would produce incorrect behavior because the wrong name would be recorded.


**[Terminology]** The usage of the "encoding" and "escaping" terms varies widely. For example, in some programming languages, the terms are used interchangeably, while other languages provide APIs that use both terms for different tasks. This overlapping usage extends to the Web, such as the "escape" JavaScript function whose purpose is stated to be encoding. The concepts of encoding and escaping predate the Web by decades. Given such a context, it is difficult for CWE to adopt a consistent vocabulary that will not be misinterpreted by some constituency.

**[Theoretical]** This is a data/directive boundary error in which data boundaries are not sufficiently enforced before it is sent to a different control sphere.

**[Research Gap]** While many published vulnerabilities are related to insufficient output encoding, there is such an emphasis on input validation as a protection mechanism that the underlying causes are rarely described. Within CVE, the focus is primarily on well-understood issues like cross-site scripting and SQL injection. It is likely that this weakness frequently occurs in custom protocols that support multiple encodings, which are not necessarily detectable with automated techniques.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-41232:** Chain: authentication routine in Go-based agile development product does not escape user name (CWE-116), allowing LDAP injection (CWE-90)
- **CVE-2008-4636:** OS command injection in backup software using shell metacharacters in a filename; correct behavior would require that this filename could not be changed.
- **CVE-2008-0769:** Web application does not set the charset when sending a page to a browser, allowing for XSS exploitation when a browser chooses an unexpected encoding.




## CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not properly assign, modify, track, or check privileges for an actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-284

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-269 is commonly misused. It can be conflated with "privilege escalation," which is a technical impact that is listed in many low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is not useful for trend analysis.
**Comments:** If an error or mistake allows privilege escalation, then use the CWE ID for that mistake. Avoid using CWE-269 when only phrases such as "privilege escalation" or "gain privileges" are available, as these indicate technical impact of the vulnerability - not the root cause weakness. If the root cause seems to be directly related to privileges, then examine the children of CWE-269 for additional hints, such as Execution with Unnecessary Privileges (CWE-250) or Incorrect Privilege Assignment (CWE-266).
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** The relationships between privileges, permissions, and actors (e.g. users and groups) need further refinement within the Research view. One complication is that these concepts apply to two different pillars, related to control of resources (CWE-664) and protection mechanism failures (CWE-693).



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2001-1555:** Terminal privileges are not reset when a user logs out.
- **CVE-2001-1514:** Does not properly pass security context to child processes in certain cases, allows privilege escalation.
- **CVE-2001-0128:** Does not properly compute roles.




## CWE-941: Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product creates a communication channel to initiate an outgoing request to an actor, but it does not correctly specify the intended destination for that actor.

### Extended Description


Attackers at the destination may be able to spoof trusted servers to steal data or cause a denial of service.


There are at least two distinct weaknesses that can cause the product to communicate with an unintended destination:


  - If the product allows an attacker to control which destination is specified, then the attacker can cause it to connect to an untrusted or malicious destination. For example, because UDP is a connectionless protocol, UDP packets can be spoofed by specifying a false source address in the packet; when the server receives the packet and sends a reply, it will specify a destination by using the source of the incoming packet - i.e., the false source. The server can then be tricked into sending traffic to the wrong host, which is effective for hiding the real source of an attack and for conducting a distributed denial of service (DDoS). As another example, server-side request forgery (SSRF) and XML External Entity (XXE) can be used to trick a server into making outgoing requests to hosts that cannot be directly accessed by the attacker due to firewall restrictions.

  - If the product incorrectly specifies the destination, then an attacker who can control this destination might be able to spoof trusted servers. While the most common occurrence is likely due to misconfiguration by an administrator, this can be resultant from other weaknesses. For example, the product might incorrectly parse an e-mail or IP address and send sensitive data to an unintended destination. As another example, an Android application may use a "sticky broadcast" to communicate with a receiver for a particular application, but since sticky broadcasts can be processed by *any* receiver, this can allow a malicious application to access restricted data that was only intended for a different application.

- **CVE-1999-1379:** DNS query with spoofed source address causes more traffic to be returned to spoofed address than was sent by the attacker.




## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Denylist / Deny List: This is used by CWE and CAPEC instead of other commonly-used terms. Its counterpart is allowlist.
Blocklist / Block List: This is often used by security tools such as firewalls, email or web gateways, proxies, etc.
Blacklist / Black List: This term is frequently used, but usage has been declining as organizations have started to adopt other terms.

**Reasons:**

### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** 

Multiple interpretation errors can indirectly introduce inputs that should be disallowed. For example, a list of dangerous shell metacharacters might not include a metacharacter that only has meaning in one particular shell, not all of them; or a check for XSS manipulations might ignore an unusual construct that is supported by one web browser, but not others.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2024-4315:** Chain: API for text generation using Large Language Models (LLMs) does not include the "\" Windows folder separator in its denylist (CWE-184) when attempting to prevent Local File Inclusion via path traversal (CWE-22), allowing deletion of arbitrary files on Windows systems.
- **CVE-2008-2309:** product uses a denylist to identify potentially dangerous content, allowing attacker to bypass a warning
- **CVE-2005-2782:** PHP remote file inclusion in web application that filters "http" and "https" URLs, but not "ftp".




## CWE-93: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses CRLF (carriage return line feeds) as a special element, e.g. to separate lines or records, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CRLF sequences from inputs.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships

**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2002-1771:** CRLF injection enables spam proxy (add mail headers) using email address or name.
- **CVE-2002-1783:** CRLF injection in API function arguments modify headers for outgoing requests.
- **CVE-2004-1513:** Spoofed entries in web server log file via carriage returns




## CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently ensuring that the resulting data will be valid.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Marshaling, Unmarshaling: Marshaling and unmarshaling are effectively synonyms for serialization and deserialization, respectively.
Pickling, Unpickling: In Python, the "pickle" functionality is used to perform serialization and deserialization.
PHP Object Injection: Some PHP application researchers use this term when attacking unsafe use of the unserialize() function; but it is also used for CWE-915.

### Relationships

**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** The relationships between CWE-502 and CWE-915 need further exploration. CWE-915 is more narrowly scoped to object modification, and is not necessarily used for deserialization.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2019-12799:** chain: bypass of untrusted deserialization issue (CWE-502) by using an assumed-trusted class (CWE-183)
- **CVE-2015-8103:** Deserialization issue in commonly-used Java library allows remote execution.
- **CVE-2015-4852:** Deserialization issue in commonly-used Java library allows remote execution.




## CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product specifies permissions for a security-critical resource in a way that allows that resource to be read or modified by unintended actors.

### Extended Description
When a resource is given a permission setting that provides access to a wider range of actors than required, it could lead to the exposure of sensitive information, or the modification of that resource by unintended parties. This is especially dangerous when the resource is related to program configuration, execution, or sensitive user data. For example, consider a misconfigured storage account for the cloud that can be read or written by a public or anonymous user.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-285
ChildOf -> CWE-668

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** While the name itself indicates an assignment of permissions for resources, this is often misused for vulnerabilities in which "permissions" are not checked, which is an "authorization" weakness (CWE-285 or descendants) within CWE's model [REF-1287].
**Comments:** Closely analyze the specific mistake that is allowing the resource to be exposed, and perform a CWE mapping for that mistake.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** The relationships between privileges, permissions, and actors (e.g. users and groups) need further refinement within the Research view. One complication is that these concepts apply to two different pillars, related to control of resources (CWE-664) and protection mechanism failures (CWE-693).



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-29527:** Go application for cloud management creates a world-writable sudoers file that allows local attackers to inject sudo rules and escalate privileges to root by winning a race condition.
- **CVE-2009-3482:** Anti-virus product sets insecure "Everyone: Full Control" permissions for files under the "Program Files" folder, allowing attackers to replace executables with Trojan horses.
- **CVE-2009-3897:** Product creates directories with 0777 permissions at installation, allowing users to gain privileges and access a socket used for authentication.
