  "query": "A vulnerability classified as problematic was found in Open Asset Import Library Assimp 5.4.3. This vulnerability affects the function AssimpMDLImporterParseTextureColorData of the file code/AssetLib/MDL/MDLMaterialLoader.cpp of the component MDL File Handler. The manipulation of the argument mWidth/mHeight leads to resource consumption. The attack can be initiated remotely. Upgrading to version 6.0 is able to address this issue. The name of the patch is 5d2a7482312db2e866439a8c05a07ce1e718bed1. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue.",
