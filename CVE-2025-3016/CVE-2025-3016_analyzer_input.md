# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-3016

## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability classified as problematic was found in Open Asset Import Library Assimp 5.4.3. This vulnerability affects the function AssimpMDLImporterParseTextureColorData of the file code/AssetLib/MDL/MDLMaterialLoader.cpp of the component MDL File Handler. The manipulation of the argument mWidth/mHeight leads to resource consumption. The attack can be initiated remotely. Upgrading to version 6.0 is able to address this issue. The name of the patch is 5d2a7482312db2e866439a8c05a07ce1e718bed1. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Here's an analysis of the provided content related to CVE-2025-3016:

**Content from github.com_43668b94_20250624_202809.html (stripped)**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:**  The vulnerability lies in the `Assimp::MDLImporter::ParseTextureColorData` function within the Assimp library. It stems from a lack of boundary validation for `pcNew->mWidth` and `pcNew->mHeight` when allocating memory for textures.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   CWE-789: Uncontrolled Memory Allocation
    *   CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can exploit the vulnerability to cause a denial-of-service (DoS). By providing a malformed MDL file, an attacker can trigger a large memory allocation, leading to a program crash.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a malformed MDL file.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted MDL file to a system running an affected version of Assimp.
*   **Mitigation or fix:**  The vulnerability is fixed in commit `5d2a748` which implements a check for maximum texture sizes inside the `ParseTextureColorData` function.
