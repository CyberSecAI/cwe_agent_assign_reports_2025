The issue arises from the way tenant IDs are handled in the application. If a user has access to multiple tenants, they can manipulate their tenant access to query and access API tokens of other tenants. This vulnerability affects the following endpoints /v1/system/token_list, /v1/system/new_token, /v1/api/token_list, /v1/api/new_token, and /v1/api/rm. An attacker can exploit this to access other tenants API tokens, perform actions on behalf of other tenants, and access their data. Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-863 CWE-639 CWE-306 CWE-285 CWE-668 CWE-284 CWE-287 CWE-532",
