    "enhanced_query": "# Vulnerability Description\n\n    The SupportCandy Helpdesk & Customer Support Ticket System plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to **Insecure Direct Object Reference** in all versions up to, and including, 3.3.0 via file upload due to **missing validation on a user controlled key**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers to download attachments for support tickets that dont belong to them. If an admin enables tickets for guests, this can be exploited by unauthenticated attackers.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'missing validation on a user controlled key'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1.
