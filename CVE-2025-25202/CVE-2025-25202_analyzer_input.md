# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-25202

## Vulnerability Description
Ash Authentication is an authentication framework for Elixir applications. Applications which have been bootstrapped by the igniter installer present since AshAuthentication v4.1.0 and who have used the magic link strategy _or_ are manually revoking tokens are affected by **revoked tokens being allowed to verify as valid**. Unless one hase implemented any kind of custom token revocation feature in your application, then one will not be affected. The impact here for users using builtin functionality is that magic link tokens are reusable until they expire. With that said, magic link tokens are only valid for 10 minutes, so the surface area for abuse is extremely low here. The flaw is patched in version 4.4.9. Additionally a compile time warning is shown to users with remediation instructions if they upgrade. 4.4.9 ships with an upgrader, so those who use `mix igniter.upgrade ash_authentication` will have the necessary patch applied. Otherwise, one may run the upgrader manually as described in the error message. As a workaround, delete the generated `revoked?` generic action in the token resource. This will cause it to use the one internal to Ash Authentication which has always been correct. Alternatively, manually make the changes that are included in the patch.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **revoked tokens being allowed to verify as valid**
- **product:** Ash Authentication
- **impact:** reusable magic link tokens, token revocation
- **version:** v4.1.0 to 4.4.8

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
CVE-2025-25202

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The flaw stems from an incorrect implementation in the `mix ash_authentication.install` generated code, specifically within the `:revoked?` action. Prior to version 4.4.9, the installer generated an action that did not correctly check for token revocation, allowing revoked tokens to be reused. This was due to missing or incorrect validation of the `:jti` and `:token` options, specifically not allowing `nil` values and not returning a `:boolean`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Flawed token revocation checking logic.
*   Incorrect action arguments (missing `allow_nil?: true`).
*   Incorrect action return type (not `:boolean`).

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Magic link tokens are reusable until they expire instead of being immediately revoked. (Default 10 minutes)
*   Password reset tokens are reusable until they expire instead of being immediately revoked. (Default 3 days)
*   Confirmation tokens are reusable until they expire instead of being immediately revoked. (Default 3 days)

**Attack vectors:**

An attacker could reuse a revoked token (magic link, password reset, or confirmation) to gain unauthorized access or perform actions as the legitimate user, as long as the token hasn't expired.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

The attacker needs to have obtained a previously issued token that has since been revoked. No special privileges are required beyond possessing a valid (but revoked) token.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   Upgrade to version 4.4.9 or later of `ash_authentication`.
*   If upgrading is not immediately possible, manually modify the generated `:revoked?` action in the token resource to:
    *   Remove `allow_nil?: false` from the `:jti` and `:token` arguments.
    *   Ensure the action returns a `:boolean`.
*   Alternatively, delete the generated `:revoked?` action and rely on the internal implementation within `AshAuthentication`, which is already correct.
*   Run `mix ash_authentication.upgrade 4.4.8 4.4.9` to apply the necessary patch.

**Additional Details:**

The content provides more detail than the official CVE description, specifically outlining the exact code changes required for manual mitigation and the impact on different token types (magic link, password reset, confirmation). It also details the warning message displayed during compilation after upgrading to version 4.4.9.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control

**Authentication**:
Determines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.

* Example phrases: "user must log in", "lack of login check", "bypasses login"
* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.

  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* – used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).

**Authorization**:
Determines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do. It decides access *after* identity is verified.

* Example phrases: "unauthorized access", "regular user can access admin panel", "role checks are missing"
* CWE relevance: use CWEs like 862, 863, 285 for authorization errors:

  * **CWE-862**: *Missing Authorization* – the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all.
  * **CWE-863**: *Incorrect Authorization* – the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).
  * **CWE-285**: *Improper Authorization* – general category for any flawed authorization logic or design.

**Access Control**:
A broader term that includes both authentication and authorization. Governs how resources are protected and who can access them under what conditions.

* CWE relevance:

  * **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* – top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear.
  * This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.

## Mapping Discussion – Common Misclassification Patterns

### 1. **CWE-306 vs CWE-862**:

* **306** is about lack of **authentication** (e.g., *no login required at all*).
* **862** is about lack of **authorization** *after* authentication (e.g., *admin check missing*).
* ✅ Example CWE-306: *“An unauthenticated attacker can invoke the password reset API.”*
* ✅ Example CWE-862: *“An authenticated user without admin privileges can delete any user account.”*

### 2. **CWE-285 vs CWE-284**:

* **285** is specific to authorization flaws – it's a better choice than 284 **if** the issue involves *improper or missing role checks*.
* **284** should be reserved for general access control issues when it’s unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.

---

## Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification

**Phrase like "unauthorized access" is not enough.**

* If you **cannot determine whether identity was checked**, assume it’s **authorization** and consider 862 or 863.
* If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** → CWE-306.
* If the **access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced**, but it's not due to missing checks, consider **CWE-284**.

---

## Good Mapping Examples

* ✅ **CWE-306**: “The endpoint `/admin/deleteUser` does not require any authentication.”
* ✅ **CWE-862**: “Any logged-in user can change any other user's email without being an admin.”
* ✅ **CWE-863**: “An admin check exists but incorrectly grants access to non-admin users.”
* ✅ **CWE-285**: “Application uses a static role check that fails when roles change dynamically.”
* ✅ **CWE-284**: “Inconsistent enforcement of access rules across services with unclear policy source.”
