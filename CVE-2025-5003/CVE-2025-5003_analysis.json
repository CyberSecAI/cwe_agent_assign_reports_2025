  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE Content\n\nThis content **RELATES** to a vulnerability, but it is not directly tied to a CVE ID as the CVE description is a placeholder. The content details a SQL injection vulnerability in \"Projectworlds Online Time Table Generator PHP MYSQL V1.0\". It provides more detail than a standard CVE description would.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the extracted information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\n*   A SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `/semester_ajax.php` file due to insufficient user input validation of the `id` parameter. The parameter is used directly in SQL queries without proper cleaning or validation.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   SQL Injection\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   Unauthorized database access\n*   Sensitive data leakage\n*   Data tampering\n*   Comprehensive system control\n*   Service interruption\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   The `id` parameter in a GET request to `/semester_ajax.php` is vulnerable.\n*   No login or authorization is required to exploit the vulnerability.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   An attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable endpoint. No authentication is required.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n1.  **Use prepared statements and parameter binding:** Separate SQL code from user input data.\n2.  **Input validation and filtering:** Validate and filter user input to ensure it conforms to the expected format.\n3.  **Minimize database user permissions:** Use database accounts with the minimum necessary permissions.\n4.  **Regular security audits:** Conduct regular code and system security audits.\n\n**Payload Examples:**\n\n*   **Time-based blind SQL injection:** `id=1'AND(SELECT 6937 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))qxsd)AND 'SMQM'='SMQM`\n*   **UNION query:** `id=1' UNION ALL SELECT NULL,CONCAT(0x7178786271.0x686b5572626a456d6776587651775278516975577776754d775a596fu75358706a4e75434a616279,0x7171707a71),NULL`\n\n**Tools Used for Verification:**\n\n*   sqlmap (example command provided: `python sqlmap.py -r sqli.txt -p id --batch`)",

The application constructs an SQL command using externally-influenced input without proper neutralization. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship that influenced the decision was the direct match between the vulnerability description and the definition of CWE-89. No parent-child or chain relationships were relevant in this case, as the description clearly points to a classic SQL Injection scenario. The base level of abstraction is appropriate as it directly describes the **improper neutralization** issue.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe89 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain consists of a single step:\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Improper neutralization** of special elements in the 'id' argument leads to SQL Injection (CWE-89).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, which strongly indicates an SQL Injection vulnerability. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions the **sql injection** in the `/semester_ajax.php` file due to the manipulation of the 'id' argument. The CVE reference links content summary confirms that the root cause is insufficient user input validation of the `id` parameter, which is then directly used in SQL queries without proper cleaning or validation. The retriever results also lists CWE-89 as the top candidate with a score of 1.0.\n\nThe selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **improper neutralization** of SQL special elements.\nI am confident in this assessment.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.
