## Vulnerability Description
The Ocean Extra plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the Flickr widget in all versions up to, and including, 2.2.8 due to **insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-5531

**Root Cause:**
*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the Ocean Extra plugin's Flickr widget. Specifically, the plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied attributes before rendering them in the Flickr widget.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. This means that malicious JavaScript code can be injected into the widget's settings and stored in the database. The injected code then executes when a user views a page containing the affected widget.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Web Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts (JavaScript) into web pages.
*   **Potential for Malicious Actions:** This can lead to various malicious actions, such as:
    *   Redirecting users to malicious sites
    *   Stealing user session cookies
    *   Modifying page content
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the logged-in user
    *   Any other actions achievable with JavaScript execution in the browser.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Flickr Widget:** The vulnerability is located in the Flickr widget of the Ocean Extra plugin.
*   **User-Supplied Attributes:** The vulnerability is triggered through user-provided attributes within the widget's settings, specifically the `id` parameter which represents the Flickr user ID.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least "contributor" level access. This means they must have the ability to modify content/widgets within WordPress.
*   **Access to Widget Settings:** The attacker must be able to access the settings of the Flickr widget to inject the malicious script via the `id` field.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerable code is located in `includes/widgets/flickr.php` of the plugin.
*   The specific line of code where the vulnerable ID is rendered is `line 58`, where it uses `strip_tags` instead of `esc_attr` or similar function for output escaping.
*   The fix involved updating the plugin to version 2.2.9.
