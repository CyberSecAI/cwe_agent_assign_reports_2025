## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
**CVE:** CVE-2025-3164 (PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval)

**RELATION TO CVE:** RELATED

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root cause:** The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper input validation and sanitization of the H2 database connection URL provided by the user. Specifically, the `INIT` parameter within the JDBC URL is not adequately restricted, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands during database initialization.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   SQL Injection
    *   Insufficient Input Validation
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server by injecting malicious SQL code into the `INIT` parameter of the H2 database connection URL. This could lead to remote code execution, data breaches, or denial of service. The provided PoC demonstrates the ability to create a file on the server (`/tmp/pwneeeee`).
*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   The attack vector involves sending a crafted POST request to the `/api/semantic/database/testConnect` endpoint with a malicious H2 database connection URL in the JSON payload.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint.  Authentication is required (Bearer token), but the example shows a token.
*   **Mitigation or fix:**
    1.  **Input Filtering (Allowlist):** Implement a regular expression allowlist to validate the H2 connection URL, ensuring it only contains valid characters and essential parameters. Example regex provided: `^jdbc:h2:mem:[a-zA-Z0-9_]+(;\\w+=\\w+)*$`
    2.  **Blacklist Filtering:** Remove or escape dangerous parameters like `INIT`, `RUNSCRIPT`, and `TRACE_LEVEL_SYSTEM_OUT` from the URL using string replacement. Example provided: `String sanitizedUrl = jdbcUrl.replaceAll(";\\s*INIT\\s*=", ";INIT_BLOCKED=");`

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects versions of SuperSonic below 0.9.8.
*   The issue reporter is willing to submit a pull request.
*   The content provides more detail than a placeholder CVE description would.
*   The PoC demonstrates a clear path to remote code execution.
