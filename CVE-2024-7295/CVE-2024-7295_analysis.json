This goes against best practices for data protection\n- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit could allow a sophisticated attacker to decrypt sensitive local asset data stored within the Telerik Report Server.\n- **Attack vectors:**  The attack vector involves exploiting the weak encryption algorithm in order to decrypt sensitive data.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  The attacker would need to be sophisticated enough to perform the decryption of the data encrypted with the vulnerable algorithm, and have access to the encrypted data itself.\n\nThe provided content gives more detail than a simple CVE description, specifying the affected versions and the recommended upgrade path.",

CWE-326 (Inadequate Encryption Strength) is considered because the older algorithm used might not provide sufficient protection. CWE-311 (Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data) is also considered because the vulnerability description mentions that local asset data was encrypted with an older algorithm, implying that encryption was used, but perhaps not strong enough or using a flawed algorithm. All three are Class level.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe327[\"CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\"]\n    cwe326[\"CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength\"]\n    cwe311[\"CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\"]\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe327 primary\n    class cwe326,cwe311 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain starts with the **root cause**: using an older, weaker encryption algorithm (CWE-327). This leads to the possibility of an attacker decrypting sensitive local asset data, which is the impact. CWE-326 (Inadequate Encryption Strength) plays a role in how easy the data is decrypted.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, which includes the vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary. The vulnerability description clearly states that the encryption of local asset data used an older algorithm, which may allow a sophisticated actor to decrypt this information. The CVE reference links content summary confirms that the root cause of the vulnerability is the use of an older, weaker encryption algorithm.\n\nCWE-327 (Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm) is selected as the primary CWE because it accurately represents the root cause of the vulnerability. The older algorithm is the **weakness**, making it vulnerable to decryption. This matches the description of CWE-327, which states that the product uses a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm or protocol. The retriever results also list CWE-327 as a potential candidate.\n\nCWE-326 (Inadequate Encryption Strength) is considered as a secondary CWE because the older algorithm might not provide sufficient encryption strength.\n\nCWE-311 (Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data) is considered as another secondary CWE because while the description states that the data was encrypted, it may as well not have been encrypted with the older algorithm.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the Class level of abstraction, which is appropriate given the information available. While more specific Base or Variant level CWEs might exist, the current evidence does not support a more precise classification.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
