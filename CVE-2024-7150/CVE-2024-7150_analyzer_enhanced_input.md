## Vulnerability Description
The Slider by 10Web - Responsive Image Slider plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to time-based SQL Injection via the id parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.57 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to insufficient escaping of the `id` parameter in the `get_slide_rows_data` function within the `WDSModelSlider.php` file. The plugin does not properly sanitize user input when constructing the SQL query, leading to a SQL injection vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a time-based SQL injection. The unsanitized `id` parameter is directly concatenated into an SQL query, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize the `id` parameter before using it in an SQL query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Attackers can exploit the SQL injection to extract sensitive information from the database, potentially including user credentials, personal data, and other confidential information.
- **Data Manipulation:** A successful SQL injection attack could allow the attacker to modify or delete data within the database.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack vector is network-based since the `id` parameter is passed via HTTP requests.
- **Authenticated:** The vulnerability can only be exploited by authenticated users with Contributor level access or higher

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker must have a valid WordPress user account with at least Contributor level privileges.
- **Knowledge of the vulnerable parameter:** The attacker needs to know that the `id` parameter in the request is vulnerable.
- **Ability to craft malicious SQL queries:** The attacker must have the skills to craft valid SQL injection payloads.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerable code is located in the `get_slide_rows_data` function in `frontend/models/WDSModelSlider.php`, specifically in the line:
`$rows = $wpdb->get_results('SELECT * FROM ' . $wpdb->prefix . 'wdsslide WHERE published=1 AND slider_id="'. $id .'" AND image_url<>"" AND image_url NOT LIKE "%images/no-image.png%" ORDER BY `order` ' . esc_sql($order_dir));`
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.2.58 of the plugin by implementing proper sanitization.
- The vulnerability was publicly disclosed on August 7, 2024.
