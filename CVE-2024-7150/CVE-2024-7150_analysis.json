  "description": "The Slider by 10Web - Responsive Image Slider plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to time-based SQL Injection via the id parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.57 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n- The vulnerability is due to insufficient escaping of the `id` parameter in the `get_slide_rows_data` function within the `WDSModelSlider.php` file. The plugin does not properly sanitize user input when constructing the SQL query, leading to a SQL injection vulnerability.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a time-based SQL injection. The unsanitized `id` parameter is directly concatenated into an SQL query, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.\n- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize the `id` parameter before using it in an SQL query.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Attackers can exploit the SQL injection to extract sensitive information from the database, potentially including user credentials, personal data, and other confidential information.\n- **Data Manipulation:** A successful SQL injection attack could allow the attacker to modify or delete data within the database.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- **Network:** The attack vector is network-based since the `id` parameter is passed via HTTP requests.\n- **Authenticated:** The vulnerability can only be exploited by authenticated users with Contributor level access or higher\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- **Authentication:** The attacker must have a valid WordPress user account with at least Contributor level privileges.\n- **Knowledge of the vulnerable parameter:** The attacker needs to know that the `id` parameter in the request is vulnerable.\n- **Ability to craft malicious SQL queries:** The attacker must have the skills to craft valid SQL injection payloads.\n\n**Additional details:**\n\n- The vulnerable code is located in the `get_slide_rows_data` function in `frontend/models/WDSModelSlider.php`, specifically in the line:\n`$rows = $wpdb->get_results('SELECT * FROM ' . $wpdb->prefix . 'wdsslide WHERE published=1 AND slider_id=\"'. $id .'\" AND image_url<>\"\" AND image_url NOT LIKE \"%images/no-image.png%\" ORDER BY `order` ' . esc_sql($order_dir));`\n- The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.2.58 of the plugin by implementing proper sanitization.\n- The vulnerability was publicly disclosed on August 7, 2024.\n\nThis analysis provides more detail than the initial CVE description placeholder.",

The description explicitly mentions **insufficient escaping** and **lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**, which are hallmarks of SQL injection vulnerabilities. The Retriever results also strongly suggested CWE-89 as the primary candidate. While other CWEs were considered, they did not directly address the root cause of the vulnerability as accurately as CWE-89.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe89 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **insufficient escaping** of the user-supplied 'id' parameter, leading to the construction of a malicious SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code, ultimately resulting in the extraction of sensitive information from the database.\n\n*   Root Cause: **Insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**\n*   Weakness: **SQL Injection**\n*   Impact: Sensitive information disclosure\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe analysis is heavily based on the provided evidence, which clearly points to an SQL injection vulnerability. The vulnerability description explicitly states that the root cause is **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**, directly aligning with the definition of CWE-89. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section further reinforces this by highlighting the lack of input sanitization as the primary issue. The Retriever results also indicated CWE-89 as the top candidate.\n\nThe selection of CWE-89 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability (improper neutralization of special elements in an SQL command).

        "extended_description": "\n\nCross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:\n\n\n  1. Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.\n\n  1. The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.\n\n  1. During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.\n\n  1. A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.\n\n  1. Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.\n\n  1. This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.\n\nThere are three main kinds of XSS:\n\n  -  **Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent)**  - The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.\n\n  -  **Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent)**  - The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs. \n\n  -  **Type 0: DOM-Based XSS**  - In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible. \n\nOnce the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"\n\nIn many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.\n",
