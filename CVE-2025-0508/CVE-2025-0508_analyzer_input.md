# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-0508

## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability in the SageMaker Workflow component of aws/sagemaker-python-sdk allows for the possibility of **MD5 hash collisions** in all versions. This can lead to workflows being inadvertently replaced due to the reuse of results from different configurations that produce the same MD5 hash. This issue can cause integrity problems within the pipeline, potentially leading to erroneous processing outcomes.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **MD5 hash collisions**
- **impact:** workflows being inadvertently replaced and integrity
- **product:** SageMaker Workflow component of aws/sagemaker-python-sdk
- **version:** all versions

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-0508 Content

Based on the provided content, this relates to a security update within the `sagemaker-python-sdk` library.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The original implementation used MD5 for file hashing, which is considered cryptographically broken and susceptible to collisions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Use of MD5 hashing algorithm. MD5 is vulnerable to collision attacks, meaning different files can produce the same hash value. This could potentially allow a malicious actor to substitute a compromised file with a legitimate one without detection.

**Impact of exploitation:**

A successful exploitation could lead to the substitution of files, potentially compromising the integrity of the system or data processed by the SDK.

**Attack vectors:**

*   An attacker could create a malicious file with the same MD5 hash as a legitimate file and replace it.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to modify files used by the SDK. This could require write access to the file system or the ability to inject malicious files into the process.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   The code was updated to use SHA256 instead of MD5 for file hashing. SHA256 is a more secure hashing algorithm that is resistant to collision attacks.

**Details beyond the official CVE description:**

The content provides specific details about the files changed (`src/sagemaker/workflow/utilities.py`) and the exact code modifications made to replace MD5 with SHA256 in several functions (`hash_object`, `hash_file`, `hash_files_or_dirs`, `_hash_file_or_dir`, `_hash_dir`, `_hash_file`). It also includes the commit message "fix: security update -> use sha256 instead of md5 for file hashing".
