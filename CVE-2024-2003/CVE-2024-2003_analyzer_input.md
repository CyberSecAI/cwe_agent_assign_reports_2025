# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-2003

## Vulnerability Description
Local **privilege escalation vulnerability** allowed an attacker to misuse ESETs file operations during a restore operation from quarantine.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **privilege escalation vulnerability**
- **impact:** Local privilege escalation
- **vector:** misuse ESETs file operations during restore operation from quarantine
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** ESET

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability arises from the misuse of ESET's file operations during a restore from quarantine. An attacker can plant malicious files in specific folders. When a user with administrative privileges initiates a restore, ESET's service is tricked into creating or overwriting arbitrary files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is a local privilege escalation issue stemming from insecure file handling during quarantine restore operations. Specifically, the lack of proper validation and sanitization of paths when restoring files from quarantine allows for arbitrary file creation and overwriting.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows a local attacker to achieve arbitrary file creation and overwrite, resulting in a local privilege escalation. This could enable the attacker to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local. An attacker must have local access to the system and be able to plant files in specific locations. The attack relies on a privileged user initiating a quarantine restore operation that involves the attacker-controlled files.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system. They must also have the capability to place malicious files in specific folders and then convince a user with administrative privileges to initiate a restore from the quarantine.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* 🔍 *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* 🔍 *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

### Mapping Discussion – CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### 🔸 CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ✅ *“A user created with the ‘guest’ role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ✅ *“The backup service runs as root but only needs read access.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ⚠️ This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### 🔸 CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ✅ *“User can access another user’s invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.”*

## Mapping Examples – Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *“User can escalate privileges to admin.”*
> ❌ Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged – only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ✅ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**

## Good Mapping Examples – Privileges & Permissions

* ✅ **CWE-266**: *“When a new user registers, the system assigns them admin role due to a missing role validation.”*
* ✅ **CWE-250**: *“Installer runs with system-level privileges but doesn't require them to install files in the user directory.”*
* ✅ **CWE-284**: *“Inconsistent access rules between UI and backend for sensitive endpoints.”*
* ✅ **CWE-285**: *“Authorization logic fails to restrict access to finance reports based on department.”*
