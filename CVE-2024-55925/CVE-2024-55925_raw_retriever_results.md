# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-55925
## Query
In Xerox Workplace Suite, an API restricted to specific hosts can be bypassed by manipulating the Host header. If the server improperly validates or trusts the Host header without verifying the actual destination, an attacker can forge a value to gain unauthorized access. This exploit targets improper host validation, potentially exposing sensitive API endpoints.

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: 'improper host header validation'
