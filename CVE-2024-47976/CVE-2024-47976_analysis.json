This suggests that an attacker can bypass the intended access controls through a physical channel, potentially due to a failure to properly remove or invalidate access credentials/permissions.\n\nThe Retriever Results list CWE-288 (Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel) as a strong candidate. This CWE aligns well with the description, as physical access constitutes an alternate channel that bypasses normal authentication procedures. CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) is a higher-level class that is too broad, and its use is discouraged when a more specific CWE is available.\n\nCWE-288 is preferred because it directly addresses the scenario where an alternate path (physical access) is used to bypass authentication. The description explicitly mentions \"physical access,\" making CWE-288 a more precise fit than the more general CWE-284. My assessment is primarily based on the vulnerability description and supported by the retriever results.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n*   CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel:\n    *   This CWE describes a scenario where authentication is bypassed by using an alternate path or channel.

While the vulnerability does involve unauthorized access, CWE-288 is more specific and accurately reflects the root cause.\n\nCWEs considered but not used:\n*   CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure - too generic.\n*   CWE-287: Improper Authentication - does not fit as the bypass uses an alternate channel.\n*   CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management - doesn't specifically address the bypass mechanism.\n*   CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer - not relevant to access control issues.\n*   CWE-1191: On-Chip Debug and Test Interface With Improper Access Control - This is a more specific case that might be related, but the description doesn't provide enough information to confirm this.\n*   CWE-1299: Missing Protection Mechanism for Alternate Hardware Interface - similar to above, not enough information.",

However, if all paths to the asset are not protected, an attacker might compromise the asset through alternate paths. These alternate paths could be through shadow or mirror registers inside the IP core, or could be paths from other external-facing interfaces to the IP core or SoC.\n\n\nConsider an SoC with various interfaces such as UART, SMBUS, PCIe, USB, etc. If access control is implemented for SoC internal registers only over the PCIe interface, then an attacker could still modify the SoC internal registers through alternate paths by coming through interfaces such as UART, SMBUS, USB, etc. \n\n\nAlternatively, attackers might be able to bypass existing protections by exploiting unprotected, shadow registers. Shadow registers and mirror registers typically refer to registers that can be accessed from multiple addresses. Writing to or reading from the aliased/mirrored address has the same effect as writing to the address of the main register. They are typically implemented within an IP core or SoC to temporarily hold certain data. These data will later be updated to the main register, and both registers will be in synch. If the shadow registers are not access-protected, attackers could simply initiate transactions to the shadow registers and compromise system security. \n",
