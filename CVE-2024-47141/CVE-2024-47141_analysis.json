  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved pinmux Use sequential access to access desc->pinmux data When two client of the same gpio call pinctrl_select_state() for the same functionality, we are seeing **NULL pointer issue** while accessing desc->mux_owner. Lets say two processes A, B executing in pin_request() for the same pin and process A updates the desc->mux_usecount but not yet updated the desc->mux_owner while process B see the desc->mux_usecount which got updated by A path and further executes strcmp and while accessing desc->mux_owner it crashes with NULL pointer. Serialize the access to mux related setting with a mutex lock. cpu0 (process A) cpu1(process B) pinctrl_select_state() { pinctrl_select_state() { pin_request() { pin_request() { ... .... } else { desc->mux_usecount++ desc->mux_usecount && strcmp(desc->mux_owner, owner)) { if (desc->mux_usecount > 1) return 0 desc->mux_owner = owner } }",

The vulnerability description also mentions a race condition due to concurrent access to shared resources without proper synchronization, which could be represented by **Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')** (CWE-362). **Improper Locking** (CWE-667) is a parent of more specific locking issues. CWE-476 can follow CWE-362.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe476[\"CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference\"]\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    cwe667[\"CWE-667: Improper Locking\"]\n\n    cwe362 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe476\n    cwe362 -->|CHILDOF| cwe667\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe476 primary\n    class cwe362,cwe667 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n1.  **Race Condition:** Concurrent access to shared resources (desc->mux\\_usecount, desc->mux\\_owner) without proper synchronization, due to **missing** or **improper locking** mechanisms.\n2.  **NULL Pointer Dereference:** Process B attempts to access desc->mux\\_owner, but it's NULL because Process A hasn't finished updating it, leading to a crash.\n\nThe root cause is the race condition, and the impact is a **NULL Pointer Dereference**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states a **NULL pointer issue** in the Linux kernel. The analysis indicates that a race condition exists where two processes concurrently access shared resources (desc->mux\\_usecount and desc->mux\\_owner) without proper locking. Process A updates desc->mux\\_usecount but hasn't yet updated desc->mux\\_owner when Process B accesses it, resulting in a **NULL pointer dereference** when Process B attempts to dereference desc->mux\\_owner.\n\nThe primary CWE is CWE-476 (**NULL Pointer Dereference**), as it is the direct cause of the crash. However, the root cause of the **NULL pointer dereference** is the race condition. Thus, CWE-362 (**Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')**) is considered as a secondary CWE to represent the underlying issue. Additionally, CWE-667 (**Improper Locking**) is added as a secondary CWE because the race condition could have been prevented with proper locking.\n\nThe selection of CWE-476 as the primary CWE is based on the direct evidence of the crash due to a **NULL pointer dereference**. The inclusion of CWE-362 and CWE-667 as secondary CWEs is based on the analysis of the race condition leading to the **NULL pointer dereference**.
