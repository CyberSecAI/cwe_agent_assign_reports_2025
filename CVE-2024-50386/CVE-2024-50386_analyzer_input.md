# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-50386

## Vulnerability Description
Account users in Apache CloudStack by default are allowed to register templates to be downloaded directly to the primary storage for deploying instances. Due to **missing validation checks** for KVM-compatible templates in CloudStack 4.0.0 through 4.18.2.4 and 4.19.0.0 through 4.19.1.2, an attacker that can register templates, can use them to deploy malicious instances on KVM-based environments and exploit this to gain access to the host filesystems that could result in the compromise of resource integrity and confidentiality, data loss, denial of service, and availability of KVM-based infrastructure managed by CloudStack. Users are recommended to upgrade to Apache CloudStack 4.18.2.5 or 4.19.1.3, or later, which addresses this issue. Additionally, all user-registered KVM-compatible templates can be scanned and checked that they are flat files that should not be using any additional or unnecessary features. For example, operators can run the following command on their file-based primary storage(s) and inspect the output. An empty output for the disk being validated means it has no references to the host filesystems on the other hand, if the output for the disk being validated is not empty, it might indicate a compromised disk. However, bear in mind that (i) volumes created from templates will have references for the templates at first and (ii) volumes can be consolidated while migrating, losing their references to the templates. Therefore, the command execution for the primary storages can show both false positives and false negatives. for file in $(find /path/to/storage/ -type f -regex [a-f0-9\-]*.*) do echo Retrieving file [$file] info. If the output is not empty, that might indicate a compromised disk check it carefully. qemu-img info -U $file | grep file printf \n\n done For checking the whole template/volume features of each disk, operators can run the following command for file in $(find /path/to/storage/ -type f -regex [a-f0-9\-]*.*) do echo Retrieving file [$file] info. qemu-img info -U $file printf \n\n done

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-50386:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation checks on KVM-compatible templates registered by users in Apache CloudStack.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Input Validation:** The system fails to adequately validate user-registered templates before they are downloaded to primary storage and used for deploying instances. Specifically, the system fails to check if the KVM-compatible templates contain malicious content or references to the host file system.
*   **Direct Download of Templates:** By default, Apache CloudStack allows account users to directly register and download templates to primary storage.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Host File System Access:** By deploying a malicious instance from a specially crafted template, an attacker can gain unauthorized access to the host file system.
*   **Compromise of Resource Integrity and Confidentiality**: This access can lead to the modification or theft of data, affecting the integrity and confidentiality of resources.
*  **Data Loss**: Attackers can cause data loss by deleting or modifying data.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation could result in denial-of-service conditions, disrupting availability of services.
*   **Availability of KVM-based Infrastructure:** The overall availability of the KVM-based infrastructure managed by CloudStack could be compromised.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   An attacker registers a malicious KVM-compatible template.
*   The malicious template is downloaded directly to the primary storage.
*   The attacker deploys an instance using the malicious template.
*   The deployed instance is used to gain access to the host file system by exploiting the references within the disk image.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs to have an account within the Apache CloudStack environment with the ability to register templates.
*   The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious KVM-compatible template.

**Additional Information**

* The vulnerability affects Apache CloudStack versions 4.0.0 through 4.18.2.4 and 4.19.0.0 through 4.19.1.2.
* The vulnerability can be remediated by upgrading to Apache CloudStack 4.18.2.5 or 4.19.1.3 or later.
* Operators can use `qemu-img` to scan existing templates and verify if they contain host file system references.
* The provided commands can generate both false positives and negatives.
