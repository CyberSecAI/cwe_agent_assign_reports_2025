# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-50386

## Description

Account users in Apache CloudStack by default are allowed to register templates to be downloaded directly to the primary storage for deploying instances. Due to **missing validation checks** for KVM-compatible templates in CloudStack 4.0.0 through 4.18.2.4 and 4.19.0.0 through 4.19.1.2, an attacker that can register templates, can use them to deploy malicious instances on KVM-based environments and exploit this to gain access to the host filesystems that could result in the compromise of resource integrity and confidentiality, data loss, denial of service, and availability of KVM-based infrastructure managed by CloudStack. Users are recommended to upgrade to Apache CloudStack 4.18.2.5 or 4.19.1.3, or later, which addresses this issue. Additionally, all user-registered KVM-compatible templates can be scanned and checked that they are flat files that should not be using any additional or unnecessary features. For example, operators can run the following command on their file-based primary storage(s) and inspect the output. An empty output for the disk being validated means it has no references to the host filesystems on the other hand, if the output for the disk being validated is not empty, it might indicate a compromised disk. However, bear in mind that (i) volumes created from templates will have references for the templates at first and (ii) volumes can be consolidated while migrating, losing their references to the templates. Therefore, the command execution for the primary storages can show both false positives and false negatives. for file in $(find /path/to/storage/ -type f -regex [a-f0-9\-]*.*) do echo Retrieving file [$file] info. If the output is not empty, that might indicate a compromised disk check it carefully. qemu-img info -U $file | grep file printf \n\n done For checking the whole template/volume features of each disk, operators can run the following command for file in $(find /path/to/storage/ -type f -regex [a-f0-9\-]*.*) do echo Retrieving file [$file] info. qemu-img info -U $file printf \n\n done

## Relationship Analysis

The primary CWE is CWE-20 Improper Input Validation, which is a class-level CWE. CWE-73 External Control of File Name or Path is a related base-level CWE. CWE-20 is a parent of many input validation related CWEs. The relationships show that input validation is a broad category, and this vulnerability falls under it.

## Vulnerability Chain

The vulnerability chain starts with the **missing validation checks** on KVM-compatible templates. This **improper input validation** allows an attacker to register a malicious template. The system then downloads the template to the primary storage, and the attacker deploys an instance using the malicious template, leading to the compromise of the host filesystem. This can then lead to resource integrity compromise, data loss, denial of service and overall compromise of KVM-based infrastructure.

## Summary of Analysis

The initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The vulnerability description explicitly states the root cause: "**missing validation checks**". This indicates a failure in input validation. The primary CWE, therefore, should reflect this **missing validation**.

CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) is a strong candidate, as it directly addresses the **lack of validation checks**. The retriever results also list CWE-20, but discourage its usage because it is a class and not a base level. However, it is the best fit. The description matches the vulnerability well: the system receives input (templates) but does not validate it, leading to potential exploitation.

CWE-73 (External Control of File Name or Path) is another possible candidate, it is a base level CWE, but it describes a specific type of improper input validation. The overall vulnerability is more general, because it is not limited to filenames or paths. It is related to the vulnerability, because the crafted images are using host file system references to access files.

The final decision is to assign CWE-20 as the primary CWE and CWE-73 as a secondary CWE. This provides a balance between identifying the general root cause and acknowledging a specific aspect of the vulnerability.
