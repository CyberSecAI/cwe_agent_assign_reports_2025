OpenFGA versions 1.8.0 through 1.8.12 (corresponding to Helm chart openfga-0.2.16 through openfga-0.2.30 and docker 1.8.0 through 1.8.12) are vulnerable to authorization bypass when certain Check and ListObject calls are executed. Users are affected under four specific conditions First, calling Check API or ListObjects with an authorization model that has a relationship directly assignable by both type bound public access and userset second, there are check or list object queries with contextual tuples for the relationship that can be directly assignable by both type bound public access and userset third, those contextual tupless user field is an userset and finally, type bound public access tuples are not assigned to the relationship. Users should upgrade to version 1.8.13 to receive a patch. The upgrade is backwards compatible.",
