  "description": "OpenFGA is an authorization/permission engine. OpenFGA versions 1.8.0 through 1.8.12 (corresponding to Helm chart openfga-0.2.16 through openfga-0.2.30 and docker 1.8.0 through 1.8.12) are vulnerable to **authorization bypass** when certain Check and ListObject calls are executed. Users are affected under four specific conditions First, calling Check API or ListObjects with an authorization model that has a relationship directly assignable by both type bound public access and userset second, there are check or list object queries with contextual tuples for the relationship that can be directly assignable by both type bound public access and userset third, those contextual tupless user field is an userset and finally, type bound public access tuples are not assigned to the relationship. Users should upgrade to version 1.8.13 to receive a patch. The upgrade is backwards compatible.",

There are check or list object queries with contextual tuples for the relationship that can be directly assignable by both type bound public access and userset, and those contextual tuples\u2019s user field is an userset, and type bound public access tuples are not assigned to the relationship.\n*   **Impact of exploitation:** Moderate severity, allows unauthorized access, potentially leading to high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability of subsequent systems.\n*   **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by specific configurations and API calls within the OpenFGA system. The attack vector is network-based.\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to make Check or ListObjects API calls under the specific conditions described. The attacker needs low privileges.\n*   **Mitigation or fix:** Upgrade to OpenFGA v1.8.13. This is a backwards-compatible upgrade.\n*   **Credits:** [udyvish](/udyvish) is credited for discovering the vulnerability.\n*   **CVSS Score:** 5.8\n\n**More Detail than CVE Description:**\n\n*   Provides details on specific conditions that must be met for the vulnerability to be exploited (authorization model, contextual tuples, etc.).\n*   Includes CVSS v4 base metrics.\n*   Includes details on the specific versions affected, as well as Helm chart and Docker versions.",

This leads to the **authorization bypass**, which results in unauthorized access and potentially affects confidentiality, integrity, and availability.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-863, \"Incorrect Authorization,\" because the vulnerability description states there is an **authorization bypass**. The other candidate CWEs, such as CWE-285 \"Improper Authorization\" and CWE-862 \"Missing Authorization\", are less descriptive of the specific nature of the vulnerability, which involves flawed authorization checks rather than a complete absence. The CWE-863 is at an acceptable level of specificity. The evidence supporting this decision is the explicit mention of \"authorization bypass\" in both the vulnerability description and the CVE reference summary, indicating that authorization mechanisms exist but are not functioning correctly.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
