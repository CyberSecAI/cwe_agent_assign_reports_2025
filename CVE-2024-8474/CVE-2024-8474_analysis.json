This is a base-level CWE. CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) is a class-level CWE and a parent of CWE-532, but it's discouraged as it describes the impact rather than the root cause. CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information) and CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information) are related to the sensitive data handling aspect but are less precise than CWE-532, which specifically addresses the logging aspect.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe532[\"CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    \n    cwe532 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe312 -->|PEEROF| cwe532\n    cwe319 -->|PEEROF| cwe532\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe532 primary\n    class cwe200,cwe312,cwe319 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **insertion of the clear-text private key into the application log** (CWE-532). This leads to the **exposure of sensitive information** (CWE-200) to an unauthorized actor. The **cleartext storage** (CWE-312) and potential **transmission** (CWE-319) of this private key are contributing factors. The ultimate impact is the ability to **decrypt VPN traffic**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is strongly based on the provided evidence, especially the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section. The root cause is the **clear-text logging of private keys**, which directly corresponds to CWE-532 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File).\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"OpenVPN Connect before version 3.5.0 can contain the configuration profiles **clear-text private key which is logged** in the application log, which an unauthorized actor can use to decrypt the VPN traffic\"\n\nThe CVE Reference Links Content Summary states: \"Root cause of vulnerability: The private key was **logged in clear-text** when debugging with Android Debug Bridge (ADB) tools.\" and \"Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: **Clear-text logging of private keys**.\"\n\nThe other CWEs were considered because of the sensitive nature of the data involved, but CWE-532 is the most accurate representation of the **root cause**. The graph relationships highlight the connection between the logging and the subsequent exposure of sensitive information. CWE-532 is at the optimal level of specificity (Base) because it directly describes the flawed action (logging sensitive data).\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product writes sensitive information to a log file.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
