# Analysis for CVE-2025-3249

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-78 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') | 1.0 | Base | Primary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-78, which is a base-level CWE. It is more specific than CWE-77, which is a class-level CWE. CWE-78 is a child of CWE-77. There are no relevant chain relationships for this vulnerability.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain is simple:
1.  **Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command (CWE-78)**: The application fails to properly neutralize special elements in externally influenced input when constructing an OS command.
2.  **Command Injection**: As a result, an attacker can inject arbitrary commands into the OS.

The root cause is CWE-78, and the impact is command injection.

## Summary of Analysis
The vulnerability description clearly states that the vulnerability is a **command injection** vulnerability. The description also indicates that the **command injection** occurs because of improper handling of input to the `apcli_cancel_wps` function.

The Retriever Results list CWE-77 [Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')] as the top result. However, CWE-78 [Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')] is a more specific base-level CWE, and the vulnerability description explicitly mentions OS commands. Therefore, CWE-78 is a better fit.

CWE-78 is at the Base level of abstraction, which is the preferred level. The usage is "Allowed".
I considered CWE-77 but chose CWE-78 as it is a more specific case of command injection involving OS commands.
