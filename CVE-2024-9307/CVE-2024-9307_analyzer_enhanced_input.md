## Vulnerability Description
The mFolio Lite plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to file uploads due to a **missing capability check** in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses the SVG file or upload arbitrary EXE files on the affected sites server which may make remote code execution possible if the attacker can also gain access to run the .exe file, or trick a site visitor into downloading and running the .exe file.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **missing capability check**
- **impact:** arbitrary file upload and inject arbitrary web scripts and remote code execution
- **attacker:** authenticated attackers with Author-level access and above
- **product:** mFolio Lite plugin for WordPress
- **version:** up to and including 1.2.1

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
