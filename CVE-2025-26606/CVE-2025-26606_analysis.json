  "description": "WeGIA is an open source Web Manager for Institutions with a focus on Portuguese language users. A SQL Injection vulnerability was discovered in the WeGIA application, `informacao_adicional.php` endpoint. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive information. This issue has been addressed in version 3.2.13 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",

The code directly uses the user-supplied input in an SQL query without sanitization.\n\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities present:\n- SQL Injection (CWE-89)\n- Improper Access Control (CWE-284)\n\nImpact of exploitation:\n- Retrieving sensitive data\n- Denial of Service (DoS)\n- Potential for file upload (under some conditions)\n\nAttack vectors:\nThe vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the `informacao_adicional.php` endpoint.\n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position:\nThe attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application. No authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability due to the lack of proper execution termination after session validation.\n\nMitigation or fix:\nThe patched version is 3.2.13.\n```",
