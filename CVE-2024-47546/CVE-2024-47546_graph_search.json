In the FOURCC_c708 case, the subtraction atom_length - 8 may result in an underflow if atom_length is less than 8. When that subtraction underflows, *cclen ends up being a large number, and then cclen is passed to g_memdup2 leading to an out-of-bounds (OOB) read. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.
