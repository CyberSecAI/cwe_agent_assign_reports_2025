  "description": "When DNSdist is configured to provide DoH via the nghttp2 provider, an attacker can cause a denial of service by crafting a DoH exchange that triggers an **illegal memory access** (**double-free**) and crash of DNSdist, causing a denial of service. The remedy is upgrade to the patched 1.9.9 version. A workaround is to temporarily switch to the h2o provider until DNSdist has been upgraded to a fixed version. We would like to thank Charles Howes for bringing this issue to our attention.",

This is a variant-level CWE, offering a specific classification. Given the vulnerability description explicitly mentions a \"double-free\", selecting CWE-415 is appropriate. There are no clear parent-child or chain relationships that influence the selection in this case, as the description is very specific about the nature of the memory corruption.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe415[\"CWE-415: Double Free\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe415 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward:\n\n1.  A specially crafted DoH exchange is sent to the DNSdist server.\n2.  The crafted exchange triggers a **double-free** condition (CWE-415).\n3.  The **double-free** leads to memory corruption and a crash, resulting in a denial of service.\n\nThe root cause is the **double-free** condition. The impact is a denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe analysis is based on the explicit mention of a **double-free** in the vulnerability description and supporting CVE details.\n\n> \"When DNSdist is configured to provide DoH via the nghttp2 provider, an attacker can cause a denial of service by crafting a DoH exchange that triggers an **illegal memory access** (**double-free**) and crash of DNSdist, causing a denial of service.\"\n\nThe evidence directly points to CWE-415 (**Double Free**).
