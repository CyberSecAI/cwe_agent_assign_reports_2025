# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2025-30194

# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2025-30194
## Query
When DNSdist is configured to provide DoH via the nghttp2 provider, an attacker can cause a denial of service by crafting a DoH exchange that triggers an illegal memory access (double-free) and crash of DNSdist, causing a denial of service. The remedy is upgrade to the patched 1.9.9 version. A workaround is to temporarily switch to the h2o provider until DNSdist has been upgraded to a fixed version. We would like to thank Charles Howes for bringing this issue to our attention.

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: 'double-free'
- **weakness**: 'illegal memory access'
