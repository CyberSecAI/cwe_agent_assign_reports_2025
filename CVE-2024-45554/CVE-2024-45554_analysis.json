This aligns well with CWE-362 (Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')). The **memory corruption** can potentially manifest as an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787).\n\nThe selection of CWE-362 is based on the explicit mention of a **race condition** in the vulnerability description: \"Memory corruption during concurrent SSR execution due to **race condition** on the global maps list.\"\n\nCWE-787 is included as a potential consequence of the **memory corruption**.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the selection by highlighting the potential link between a **race condition** and **out-of-bounds writes**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-366: Race Condition within a Thread\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nIf two threads of execution use a resource simultaneously, there exists the possibility that resources may be used while invalid, in turn making the state of execution undefined.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-662: Improper Synchronization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product utilizes multiple threads or processes to allow temporary access to a shared resource that can only be exclusive to one process at a time, but it does not properly synchronize these actions, which might cause simultaneous accesses of this resource by multiple threads or processes.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
