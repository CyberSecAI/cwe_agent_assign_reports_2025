  "description": "OpenFGA is an authorization/permission engine. IN OpenFGA v1.3.8 to v1.8.2 (Helm chart openfga-0.1.38 to openfga-0.2.19, docker v1.3.8 to v.1.8.2) are vulnerable to **authorization bypass** under the following conditions 1. calling Check API or ListObjects with a model that uses [conditions](https//openfga.dev/docs/modeling/conditions), and 2. calling Check API or ListObjects API with [contextual tuples](https//openfga.dev/docs/concepts#what-are-contextual-tuples) that include conditions and 3. OpenFGA is configured with caching enabled (`OPENFGA_CHECK_QUERY_CACHE_ENABLED`). Users are advised to upgrade to v1.8.3. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",

It provides a detailed security advisory for OpenFGA, including the CVE ID. The content provides more detail than the placeholder CVE description.\n\nHere's an extraction of relevant information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability is due to an authorization bypass when certain `Check` and `ListObject` calls are executed in OpenFGA versions v1.3.8 to v1.8.2 (and corresponding Helm chart and Docker versions).\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Authorization Bypass\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nSuccessful exploitation can lead to High impact on Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability of subsequent systems.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Network\n*   Requires calling `Check` API or `ListObjects` with a model that uses conditions.\n*   OpenFGA must be configured with caching enabled (`OPENFGA_CHECK_QUERY_CACHE_ENABLED`).\n*   API calls must contain contextual tuples that include conditions.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   Low privileges required.\n*   No user interaction is needed.\n*   Attacker needs network access.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   Upgrade to v1.8.3 (or Helm chart 0.2.19, or Docker v1.8.3). The upgrade is backwards compatible.\n\n**CVSS v4 Metrics:**\n\n*   Attack Vector: Network\n*   Attack Complexity: Low\n*   Attack Requirements: Present\n*   Privileges Required: Low\n*   User interaction: None\n*   Confidentiality: None (Vulnerable System), High (Subsequent System)\n*   Integrity: None (Vulnerable System), High (Subsequent System)\n*   Availability: None (Vulnerable System), High (Subsequent System)\n\n**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-56323\n\n**Credits:** miparnisari (Finder)",

The root cause is the **incorrect authorization** logic, where the system fails to properly validate user permissions when conditions and contextual tuples with caching are used in the `Check` and `ListObjects` APIs.\n2.  This leads to the **authorization bypass**, where an attacker can gain unauthorized access to resources or functionalities.\n3.  The impact is high confidentiality, integrity, and availability risks for subsequent systems.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is **authorization bypass**. The vulnerability description and the CVE reference summary both point to a flaw in the authorization logic when handling conditions, contextual tuples, and caching. The **authorization bypass** occurs because the system **incorrectly authorizes** the user's access, leading to unintended access to resources.\n\nThe initial assessment based on the description was that it's an authorization issue, and CWE-863 fits best. The guidance further reinforced this by clearly stating that when authorization checks are present but flawed, CWE-863 is the appropriate choice.\n\nCWE-284, CWE-285, and CWE-862 were considered but ruled out. CWE-284 is too high-level. CWE-285 is a general authorization flaw, and CWE-862 indicates that authorization checks are missing. In this case, the checks exist but are implemented incorrectly.\n\nCWE-306 **Missing Authentication for Critical Function** was considered because when calling Check API or ListObjects with a model that uses [conditions](https//openfga.dev/docs/modeling/conditions), and calling Check API or ListObjects API with [contextual tuples](https//openfga.dev/docs/concepts#what-are-contextual-tuples) that include conditions, it may lead to missing authentication when OpenFGA is configured with caching enabled (`OPENFGA_CHECK_QUERY_CACHE_ENABLED`).\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly address the root cause and nature of the vulnerability. CWE-863 describes the **incorrect authorization**, and CWE-306 describes the case where it could lead to **missing authentication**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 2561.28\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 2.47\n**Source**: graph\n\n**Description**:\nCWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.",
