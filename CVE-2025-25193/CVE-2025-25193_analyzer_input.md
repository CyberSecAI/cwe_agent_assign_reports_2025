# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-25193

## Vulnerability Description
Netty, an asynchronous, event-driven network application framework, has a vulnerability in versions up to and including 4.1.118.Final. An **unsafe reading of environment file** could potentially cause a denial of service in Netty. When loaded on an Windows application, Netty attempts to load a file that does not exist. If an attacker creates such a large file, the Netty application crash. A similar issue was previously reported as CVE-2024-47535. This issue was fixed, but the fix was incomplete in that null-bytes were not counted against the input limit. Commit d1fbda62d3a47835d3fb35db8bd42ecc205a5386 contains an updated fix.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **unsafe reading of environment file**
- **impact:** application crash and denial of service
- **vector:** large file
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** Netty
- **version:** versions up to and including 4.1.118.Final

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
```
Root cause of vulnerability:
An unsafe reading of environment file could potentially cause a denial of service in Netty. When loaded on a Windows application, Netty attempts to load a file that does not exist. If an attacker creates such a large file, the Netty application crashes. The fix for a similar issue was incomplete in that null-bytes were not counted against the input limit.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
Denial of Service.

Impact of exploitation:
The Netty application crashes.

Attack vectors:
When the null-bytes are encountered by the InputStreamReader, it will issue replacement characters in its charset decoding, which will fill up the line-buffer in the BufferedReader.readLine(), because the replacement character is not a line-break character.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
An attacker needs to create a large file containing only null-bytes.

Mitigation or fix:
Patched versions 4.1.118.Final
