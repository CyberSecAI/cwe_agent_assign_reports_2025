CWE-306 and CWE-287 are related to authentication issues and could be relevant depending on the specific implementation details. The choice of CWE-308 reflects the reliance on a single factor (the cookie) for authentication, which makes it vulnerable to bypass.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe308[\"CWE-308: Use of Single-factor Authentication\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n\n    cwe308 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1390\n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe308 primary\n    class cwe1390,cwe306,cwe287 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **weakness** of storing the two-factor code in a cookie without proper validation. This leads to the ability to bypass two-factor authentication, effectively compromising the security of the system.\n  - **Root Cause:** Two-factor code stored in cookie (**CWE-308**)\n  - **Impact:** Bypass two-factor authentication\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified several potential CWEs, including CWE-1390, CWE-287, and CWE-308. Based on the provided evidence, the vulnerability is primarily due to the **use of a single factor (the cookie) for authentication, without sufficient validation**. This aligns directly with CWE-308.\n\nThe vulnerability description states that the \"two-factor code being stored in a cookie, which makes it possible to bypass two-factor authentication\". The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms this by stating: \"The two-factor authentication code is stored in a cookie without proper validation or integrity checks.\"\n\nCWE-308 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the use of single-factor authentication. While CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication) is a broader category, CWE-308 provides a more precise description of the **root cause**. CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) and CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) were considered but deemed less appropriate as they do not specifically address the issue of single-factor authentication.\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web
