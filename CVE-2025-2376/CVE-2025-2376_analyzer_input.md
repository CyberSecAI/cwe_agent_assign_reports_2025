# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-2376

## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability has been found in viames Pair Framework up to 1.9.11 and classified as critical. Affected by this vulnerability is the function getCookieContent of the file /src/UserRemember.php of the component PHP Object Handler. The manipulation of the argument cookieName leads to **deserialization**. The attack can be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **deserialization**
- **vector:** manipulation of cookieName argument
- **product:** viames Pair Framework
- **version:** up to 1.9.11
- **component:** /src/UserRemember.php PHP Object Handler function getCookieContent

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Here's an analysis of the provided content:

*   **Relevance:** The content directly relates to a PHP Object Injection vulnerability in the Pair Framework. This aligns with the potential for vulnerabilities that could be described in CVE-2025-2376.

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability arises from the deserialization of untrusted data. Specifically, Pair Framework uses `unserialize()` on the contents of a cookie without proper validation, allowing for object injection.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary vulnerability is PHP Object Injection (CWE-502, CAPEC-586). The code takes input from a cookie and passes it to `unserialize()`.

*   **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary file writes, including the potential for uploading a webshell. Depending on the gadget chains available in the application, remote code execution is also possible.

*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a crafted HTTP request. An attacker sets a malicious value for the "remember me" cookie.

*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to set or modify the value of the "remember me" cookie. The attacker also needs to know the value of `PRODUCT_NAME` to construct the correct cookie name.

*   **Mitigation or fix:** The suggested mitigation is to use the `allowed_classes` option with `unserialize()` to restrict the classes that can be deserialized or replace serialization with `json_encode` and `json_decode`.

*   **More detail than CVE description:** Yes, the content provides more detail than a standard CVE description. It includes specific code examples, the vulnerable file and line numbers, steps to reproduce, and a proof of concept exploit.
