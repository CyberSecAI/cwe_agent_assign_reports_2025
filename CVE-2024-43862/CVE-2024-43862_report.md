# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-43862

## Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved net wan fsl_qmc_hdlc Convert carrier_lock spinlock to a mutex The carrier_lock spinlock protects the carrier detection. While it is held, framer_get_status() is called which in turn takes a mutex. This is not correct and can lead to a deadlock. A run with PROVE_LOCKING enabled detected the issue [ BUG Invalid wait context ] ... c204ddbc (&framer->mutex){+.+.}-{33}, at framer_get_status+0x40/0x78 other info that might help us debug this context-{44} 2 locks held by ifconfig/146 #0 c0926a38 (rtnl_mutex){+.+.}-{33}, at devinet_ioctl+0x12c/0x664 #1 c2006a40 (&qmc_hdlc->carrier_lock){....}-{22}, at qmc_hdlc_framer_set_carrier+0x30/0x98 Avoid the spinlock usage and convert carrier_lock to a mutex.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-667 | Improper Locking | 1.0 | Class | Primary | Allowed-with-Review |
| CWE-833 | Deadlock | 0.9 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.95
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship is between CWE-667 (**Improper Locking**) and CWE-833 (**Deadlock**). CWE-833 is a child of CWE-662 (**Improper Synchronization**), which in turn is a parent of CWE-667. This hierarchy shows that **improper locking** can lead to a **deadlock** condition.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **improper locking** (CWE-667) due to the **use of framer_get_status() while holding carrier_lock spinlock**. This leads to a lock inversion where a spinlock is held while trying to acquire a mutex, ultimately resulting in a **deadlock** (CWE-833).

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is based on the provided evidence, which clearly indicates a locking issue leading to a deadlock. The "**rootcause:** **Use of framer_get_status() while holding carrier_lock spinlock**" and "**weakness:** **improper locking**" are key phrases from the Vulnerability Description. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that "The `carrier_lock` was implemented as a spinlock. While this spinlock is held, the `framer_get_status()` function is called which in turn tries to acquire a mutex. This creates a lock inversion, which can lead to a deadlock." This directly supports the selection of CWE-667 (**Improper Locking**) as the primary weakness and CWE-833 (**Deadlock**) as a resulting condition. The graph relationships reinforce the understanding of how **improper locking** can result in a **deadlock**.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-833: Deadlock
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product contains multiple threads or executable segments that are waiting for each other to release a necessary lock, resulting in deadlock.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-667: Improper Locking
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-413: Improper Resource Locking
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not lock or does not correctly lock a resource when the product must have exclusive access to the resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-1285: Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input that is expected to specify an index, position, or offset into an indexable resource such as a buffer or file, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the specified index/position/offset has the required properties.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
