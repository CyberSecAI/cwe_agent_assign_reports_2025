# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-43862
## Query
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved net wan fsl_qmc_hdlc Convert carrier_lock spinlock to a mutex The carrier_lock spinlock protects the carrier detection. While it is held, framer_get_status() is called which in turn takes a mutex. This is not correct and can lead to a deadlock. A run with PROVE_LOCKING enabled detected the issue [ BUG Invalid wait context ] ... c204ddbc (&framer->mutex){+.+.}-{33}, at framer_get_status+0x40/0x78 other info that might help us debug this context-{44} 2 locks held by ifconfig/146 #0 c0926a38 (rtnl_mutex){+.+.}-{33}, at devinet_ioctl+0x12c/0x664 #1 c2006a40 (&qmc_hdlc->carrier_lock){....}-{22}, at qmc_hdlc_framer_set_carrier+0x30/0x98 Avoid the spinlock usage and convert carrier_lock to a mutex.

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: 'Use of framer_get_status() while holding carrier_lock spinlock'
- **weakness**: 'improper locking'
