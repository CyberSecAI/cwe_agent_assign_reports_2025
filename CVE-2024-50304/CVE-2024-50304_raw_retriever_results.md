## Query
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ipv4 ip_tunnel Fix suspicious RCU usage warning in ip_tunnel_find() The per-netns IP tunnel hash table is protected by the RTNL mutex and ip_tunnel_find() is only called from the control path where the mutex is taken. Add a lockdep expression to hlist_for_each_entry_rcu() in ip_tunnel_find() in order to validate that the mutex is held and to silence the suspicious RCU usage warning [1].

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: 'The per-netns IP tunnel hash table is protected by the RTNL mutex but hlist_for_each_entry_rcu() in ip_tunnel_find() was not validating that the mutex was held', 'leading to a suspicious RCU usage warning.'
- **weakness**: 'The code was missing a lockdep expression to validate the RTNL mutex is held before using hlist_for_each_entry_rcu().'
