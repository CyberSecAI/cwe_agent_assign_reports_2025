## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-2662 Content

Based on the provided content, this report details a SQL injection vulnerability in "projectworlds Online Time Table Generator Portal-Source code".

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient user input validation of the 'course' parameter in the `student/studentdashboard.php` file.  The application directly uses this parameter in SQL queries without proper sanitization or validation, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   SQL Injection

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Unauthorized database access
*   Sensitive data leakage
*   Data tampering
*   System control
*   Service interruption

**Attack vectors:**

*   The 'course' parameter in the `student/studentdashboard.php` file is vulnerable.  The provided payload demonstrates a time-based blind SQL injection attack using `sqlmap`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the `student/studentdashboard.php` endpoint.
*   Knowledge of SQL injection techniques and tools like `sqlmap` is beneficial.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   **Use prepared statements and parameter binding:** This separates SQL code from user input, preventing the input from being interpreted as code.
*   **Input validation and filtering:**  Strictly validate and filter user input to ensure it conforms to the expected format.
*   **Minimize database user permissions:** Use database accounts with the least necessary privileges.
*   **Regular security audits:** Conduct regular code and system security audits.

**Additional Details (More than official CVE description):**

*   The report provides a specific payload example using `sqlmap` to demonstrate the vulnerability.
*   It includes a sample HTTP POST request that can be used to exploit the vulnerability.
*   It details the vulnerable file (`student/studentdashboard.php`) and parameter (`course`).
*   The report also provides links to the vendor's homepage and the software download location.
*   The report includes screenshots from `sqlmap` showing successful database enumeration.
