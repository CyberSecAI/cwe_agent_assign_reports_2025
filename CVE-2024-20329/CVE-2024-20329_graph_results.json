  "query": "A vulnerability in the SSH subsystem of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute operating system commands as root. This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting crafted input when executing remote CLI commands over SSH. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute commands on the underlying operating system with root-level privileges. An attacker with limited user privileges could use this vulnerability to gain complete control over the system.",
