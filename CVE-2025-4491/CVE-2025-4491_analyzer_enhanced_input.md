## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-4491 Content

Based on the provided content, this relates to a SQL injection vulnerability in the "Online Food Ordering System V1.0" by campcodes. The CVE description is a placeholder, but the content provides significantly more detail than a standard CVE description.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper cleaning or validation of the `ticket_id` parameter in the `/routers/ticket-status.php` file. Attackers can inject malicious code through this parameter directly into SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   SQL Injection

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Unauthorized database access
*   Sensitive data leakage
*   Data tampering
*   System control
*   Service interruption

**Attack vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is exploitable without login or authorization.
*   The `ticket_id` parameter (POST request) is the entry point for the attack.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   No specific privileges or authentication are required. An attacker only needs to be able to send a POST request to the `/routers/ticket-status.php` endpoint.
*   Knowledge of SQL injection techniques is required to craft effective payloads.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   **Use prepared statements and parameter binding:** This separates SQL code from user input.
*   **Input validation and filtering:** Validate and filter user input to ensure it conforms to the expected format.
*   **Minimize database user permissions:** Use accounts with the minimum necessary permissions to connect to the database.
*   **Regular security audits:** Conduct regular code and system security audits.

**Payload Examples:**

The content provides several example payloads for different types of SQL injection attacks:

*   Boolean-based blind SQL injection
*   Time-based blind SQL injection
*   UNION query SQL injection
