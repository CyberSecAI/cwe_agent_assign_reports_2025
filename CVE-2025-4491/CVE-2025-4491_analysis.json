  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-4491 Content\n\nBased on the provided content, this relates to a SQL injection vulnerability in the \"Online Food Ordering System V1.0\" by campcodes. The CVE description is a placeholder, but the content provides significantly more detail than a standard CVE description.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability is due to the lack of proper cleaning or validation of the `ticket_id` parameter in the `/routers/ticket-status.php` file. Attackers can inject malicious code through this parameter directly into SQL queries.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   SQL Injection\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   Unauthorized database access\n*   Sensitive data leakage\n*   Data tampering\n*   System control\n*   Service interruption\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   The vulnerability is exploitable without login or authorization.\n*   The `ticket_id` parameter (POST request) is the entry point for the attack.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   No specific privileges or authentication are required. An attacker only needs to be able to send a POST request to the `/routers/ticket-status.php` endpoint.\n*   Knowledge of SQL injection techniques is required to craft effective payloads.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   **Use prepared statements and parameter binding:** This separates SQL code from user input.\n*   **Input validation and filtering:** Validate and filter user input to ensure it conforms to the expected format.\n*   **Minimize database user permissions:** Use accounts with the minimum necessary permissions to connect to the database.\n*   **Regular security audits:** Conduct regular code and system security audits.\n\n**Payload Examples:**\n\nThe content provides several example payloads for different types of SQL injection attacks:\n\n*   Boolean-based blind SQL injection\n*   Time-based blind SQL injection\n*   UNION query SQL injection\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n*   **Affected Product:** Online Food Ordering System V1.0\n*   **Vendor Homepage:** [https://www.campcodes.com/downloads/online-food-ordering-system-using-php-mysqli/](https://www.campcodes.com/downloads/online-food-ordering-system-using-php-mysqli/)\n*   **Vulnerable File:** `/routers/ticket-status.php`\n*   **Software Link:** [https://www.campcodes.com/downloads/online-food-ordering-system-using-php-mysqli/?wpdmdl=5818&ind=0](https://www.campcodes.com/downloads/online-food-ordering-system-using-php-mysqli/?wpdmdl=5818&ind=0)\n*   The content includes a screenshot of `sqlmap` output demonstrating the vulnerability.",

CWE-89 is a base-level CWE, indicating a specific type of injection vulnerability. There aren't many relevant chain relationships in this case, as the focus is primarily on the **root cause** of the **SQL injection** itself. Other CWEs considered were broader (like CWE-74) or focused on different attack vectors (like CWE-79). The base level of CWE-89 is appropriate because it directly addresses the **SQL injection** **weakness**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    \n    cwe89 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe89 primary\n    class cwe74 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain here is straightforward:\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Improper neutralization** of special elements in the `ticket_id` parameter, leading to CWE-89 (**SQL Injection**).\n2.  **Impact:** Unauthorized database access, sensitive data leakage, data tampering, system control, service interruption.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary assessment is based on the clear identification of **SQL injection** as the **weakness** in the provided description and CVE content summary. The vulnerability description explicitly states that the manipulation of the `ticket_id` argument leads to **SQL injection**. The CVE content summary further confirms this by stating that the **root cause** is the lack of proper cleaning or validation of the `ticket_id` parameter, allowing attackers to inject malicious code into SQL queries.\n\nThe graph relationships helped to confirm that a more specific CWE was available (CWE-89) rather than a more general one (e.g., CWE-74).\n\nThe selection of CWE-89 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly represents the **SQL injection** vulnerability described in the provided information.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.
