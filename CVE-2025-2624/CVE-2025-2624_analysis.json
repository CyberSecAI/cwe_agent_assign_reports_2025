  "reference_content": "CVE-2025-2624 is a placeholder, so I will analyze the provided content for vulnerabilities.\n\nThe content details a SQL injection vulnerability in CicadasCMS v1.0. Here's a breakdown of the information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe `content`, `fujian`, and `laiyuan` fields of the `/system/cms/content/save` interface are vulnerable because the application doesn't properly sanitize user input before incorporating it into a SQL query. Specifically, the `SaveModelFiledParam` method dynamically concatenates form data into an `exeSql` insert statement without proper escaping or parameterization.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n* SQL Injection (specifically, SQL error-based injection)\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\nAttackers can steal sensitive data from the database by constructing malicious SQL statements.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n* An attacker can send a crafted POST request to the `/system/cms/content/save` interface with malicious payloads in the `content`, `fujian`, or `laiyuan` parameters. The provided examples demonstrate using payloads designed to extract data using `extractvalue` and MD5 hashing.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n* The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint. No authentication is explicitly mentioned as being required in the provided information.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\nThe content does not provide specific mitigation steps, but the root cause analysis implies that proper input sanitization and parameterized queries should be implemented to prevent SQL injection.\n\n**Additional Details (more detail than official CVE description):**\n\n*   **Affected Code Location:** `com.zhiliao.module.web.cms.ContentController#save` and `com.zhiliao.module.web.cms.service.impl.ContentServiceImpl#SaveModelFiledParam`\n*   **Proof of Concept:** The content includes example HTTP POST requests with malicious payloads demonstrating the vulnerability.\n*   **Product Vendor:** <https://gitee.com/westboy/CicadasCMS>\n*   **Affected Product Code Repository:** v1.0",

The application constructs an SQL command using externally-influenced input without proper neutralization. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship considered was the hierarchical structure with CWE-74, the parent Class of CWE-89. However, the evidence clearly indicates SQL injection, making the more specific Base CWE-89 the appropriate choice. No other relationships significantly influenced the decision.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    \n    cwe89 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe89 primary\n    class cwe74 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is as follows:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Improper neutralization** of user-supplied input within the `content/fujian/laiyuan` argument.\n2.  **Weakness:** The **SQL Injection** vulnerability itself (CWE-89).\n3.  **Impact:** Potential for attackers to steal sensitive data from the database.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, particularly the phrase \"**sql injection**\" and the description of how manipulating the `content/fujian/laiyuan` argument leads to the vulnerability. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" further clarifies the root cause as the application **not properly sanitizing** user input before incorporating it into a SQL query.\n\nThe retriever results strongly support CWE-89 as the primary candidate, with a score of 1.0. The relationship analysis confirms that while CWE-74 is a broader category, CWE-89 is the most specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability.\n\nThe selection of CWE-89 is at the optimal level of specificity because the evidence explicitly points to SQL injection, and CWE-89 is the designated CWE for this type of vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-96: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Statically Saved Code ('Static Code Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes code syntax before inserting the input into an executable resource, such as a library, configuration file, or template.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.
