## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
CVE-2025-2624 is a placeholder, so I will analyze the provided content for vulnerabilities.

The content details a SQL injection vulnerability in CicadasCMS v1.0. Here's a breakdown of the information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `content`, `fujian`, and `laiyuan` fields of the `/system/cms/content/save` interface are vulnerable because the application doesn't properly sanitize user input before incorporating it into a SQL query. Specifically, the `SaveModelFiledParam` method dynamically concatenates form data into an `exeSql` insert statement without proper escaping or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
* SQL Injection (specifically, SQL error-based injection)

**Impact of exploitation:**
Attackers can steal sensitive data from the database by constructing malicious SQL statements.

**Attack vectors:**
* An attacker can send a crafted POST request to the `/system/cms/content/save` interface with malicious payloads in the `content`, `fujian`, or `laiyuan` parameters. The provided examples demonstrate using payloads designed to extract data using `extractvalue` and MD5 hashing.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
* The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint. No authentication is explicitly mentioned as being required in the provided information.

**Mitigation or fix:**
The content does not provide specific mitigation steps, but the root cause analysis implies that proper input sanitization and parameterized queries should be implemented to prevent SQL injection.

**Additional Details (more detail than official CVE description):**

*   **Affected Code Location:** `com.zhiliao.module.web.cms.ContentController#save` and `com.zhiliao.module.web.cms.service.impl.ContentServiceImpl#SaveModelFiledParam`
*   **Proof of Concept:** The content includes example HTTP POST requests with malicious payloads demonstrating the vulnerability.
*   **Product Vendor:** <https://gitee.com/westboy/CicadasCMS>
*   **Affected Product Code Repository:** v1.0
