*   Privilege Escalation (CVE-2025-23093)

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **CVE-2025-23094:** Allows an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary commands with the same privilege level as the web access process, resulting in low impact to confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
*   Exploiting both vulnerabilities (CVE-2025-23093 and CVE-2025-23094) together can significantly amplify the impact, potentially resulting in a critical severity.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **CVE-2025-23094:** Unauthenticated, network-accessible.
*   **CVE-2025-23093:** Authenticated, local access.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **CVE-2025-23094:** No authentication required.
*   **CVE-2025-23093:** Requires authentication.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   Upgrade to OpenScape 4000 PLT Hotfix (System & Manager) V10 R1.42.7 or V10 R1.54.2 or later.
*   Upgrade to OpenScape 4000 PLT Hotfix (System & Manager) V11 R0.22.2 or later.
*   **Workaround (V10/V11 & Manager V11):** Activate the “Restricted access to Platform Portal and SSH of Platform and CSTA” flag in Access Management -> Security Mode Configuration -> Application Access.
*   **Workaround (Manager V10):** Enable secure mode on the platform via the command line: `/opt/webservice/scripts/swupdated set_ui_mode 1`.

**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**

*   The advisory credits Dr. Oliver Matula, Maximilian Platzner, and Tim Kornhuber of DB Systel GmbH for discovering the vulnerabilities.
*   The advisory specifies impacted deployment options: Central Host, Manager, SoftGate, Enterprise Gateway and partially STMIX.
*   CVSS 3.1 Base Scores are provided: 7.3 for CVE-2025-23094 and 7.8 for CVE-2025-23093.
*   Revision history is included.
*   The advisory details the steps to revert the workaround.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* 🔍 *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* 🔍 *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion – CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### 🔸 CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ✅ *“A user created with the ‘guest’ role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ✅ *“The backup service runs as root but only needs read access.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ⚠️ This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### 🔸 CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ✅ *“User can access another user’s invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.”*

## Mapping Examples – Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *“User can escalate privileges to admin.”*
> ❌ Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged – only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ✅ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**

| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| “Escalate to root/admin”                    | Privilege escalation impact           | Not CWE-269! Use root cause (e.g., 266, 250) |
| “Assigned wrong role/group”                 | Misassigned privilege                 | CWE-266                                      |
| “Runs as root” or “Should not run as admin” | Over-privileged execution             | CWE-250                                      |
| “Unauthorized read/write to file”           | Permission control issue              | CWE-285                                      |
| “Can access resource without correct role”  | Incorrect or missing permission check | CWE-285, 862, 863                            |

## Good Mapping Examples – Privileges & Permissions

* ✅ **CWE-266**: *“When a new user registers, the system assigns them admin role due to a missing role validation.”*
* ✅ **CWE-250**: *“Installer runs with system-level privileges but doesn't require them to install files in the user directory.”*
* ✅ **CWE-284**: *“Inconsistent access rules between UI and backend for sensitive endpoints.”*
* ✅ **CWE-285**: *“Authorization logic fails to restrict access to finance reports based on department.”*
