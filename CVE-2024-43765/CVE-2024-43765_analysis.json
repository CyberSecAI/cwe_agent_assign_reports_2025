CWE-451 is a Class level and parent of more specific Base level CWEs. CWE-862 is a Base level CWE related to authorization issues. The relationship analysis is used to select the most relevant CWEs.

This can lead to the attacker gaining unauthorized access to a folder, resulting in local escalation of privilege.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness identified is **tapjacking**/**overlay attack**, which falls under **CWE-1021: Improper Restriction of Rendered UI Layers or Frames**. This is due to the application's failure to properly restrict or validate UI layers, allowing an attacker to overlay a malicious interface on top of the legitimate one. This can lead to user interaction that grants the attacker access to resources they should not have.\n\nSupporting evidence:\n- \"In multiple locations, there is a possible way to obtain access to a folder due to a **tapjacking**/**overlay attack**.\"\n- \"This could lead to local escalation of privilege...\"\n\nCWE-451 was considered because the attack involves misrepresentation of critical information, but it is a higher-level class and CWE-1021 is more specific.\n\nCWE-862 was considered because the attack leads to unauthorized access, but the root cause is the UI layering issue rather than a direct authorization bypass.\n\nThe final selection of CWE-1021 is based on its direct relevance to the **tapjacking**/**overlay attack** and its base-level specificity.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-451: User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe user interface (UI) does not properly represent critical information to the user, allowing the information - or its source - to be obscured or spoofed.
