### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **sql injection**
- **vector:** manipulation of the argument cname
- **product:** Codezips Blood Bank Management System
- **version:** 1.0
- **component:** /campaign.php

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the security vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The `/campaign.php` script directly incorporates user input from the `cname` parameter into SQL queries without proper sanitization or validation. This allows for the injection of malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability in the `/campaign.php` file due to lack of input sanitization and use of unsanitized input in SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Unauthorized Database Access:** Ability to read sensitive data.
-   **Data Leakage:** Potential exposure of confidential information.
-   **Data Tampering:** Ability to modify or delete records.
-   **System Control:** Possibility of full system compromise.
-   **Service Interruption:** Disruption of normal operations.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by sending malicious crafted HTTP requests to the `/campaign.php` endpoint by manipulating the `cname` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not require any authentication or authorization to exploit this vulnerability. It can be accessed by anyone who can reach the vulnerable endpoint.

**Additional Information:**
- The report includes several Proof of Concept (PoC) payloads demonstrating the different types of SQL injection that can be performed such as boolean-based, error-based, time-based, and union query injections.
- It also provides steps to use `sqlmap` to automate the exploitation of the vulnerability, using a sample `sqlmap` command.
- The vulnerability is categorized as high severity due to its ease of exploitation and potential impact.
