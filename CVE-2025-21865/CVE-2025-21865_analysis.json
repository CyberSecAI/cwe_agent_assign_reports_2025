  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved gtp Suppress list corruption splat in gtp_net_exit_batch_rtnl(). Brad Spengler reported the list_del() corruption splat in gtp_net_exit_batch_rtnl(). [0] Commit eb28fd76c0a0 (gtp Destroy device along with udp sockets netns dismantle.) added the for_each_netdev() loop in gtp_net_exit_batch_rtnl() to destroy devices in each netns as done in geneve and ip tunnels. However, this could trigger ->dellink() twice for the same device during ->exit_batch_rtnl(). Say we have two netns A & B and gtp device B that resides in netns B but whose UDP socket is in netns A. 1. cleanup_net() processes netns A and then B. 2. gtp_net_exit_batch_rtnl() finds the device B while iterating netns As gn->gtp_dev_list and calls ->dellink(). [ device B is not yet unlinked from netns B as unregister_netdevice_many() has not been called. ] 3. gtp_net_exit_batch_rtnl() finds the device B while iterating netns Bs for_each_netdev() and calls ->dellink(). gtp_dellink() cleans up the devices hash table, unlinks the dev from gn->gtp_dev_list, and calls unregister_netdevice_queue(). Basically, calling gtp_dellink() multiple times is fine unless CONFIG_DEBUG_LIST is enabled. Lets remove for_each_netdev() in gtp_net_exit_batch_rtnl() and delegate the destruction to default_device_exit_batch() as done in bareudp.

Memory is not released which can lead to double free. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary weakness is a **Double Free (CWE-415)**, which is a variant-level CWE, indicating a specific type of memory management error. **CWE-415** can be related to **CWE-401 (Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime)**, as a failure to manage memory lifetime can lead to double frees.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe415[\"CWE-415: Double Free\"]\n    cwe401[\"CWE-401: Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime\"]\n\n    cwe415 -->|CANRESULTIN| cwe401\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe415 primary\n    class cwe401 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the incorrect handling of net namespaces and device cleanup, leading to a device being processed twice during the `exit_batch_rtnl` phase. This double processing results in the `gtp_dellink()` function being called multiple times for the same device. The first call frees the device, and the subsequent call results in a **double free**, triggering a kernel BUG.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis indicates a **Double Free** vulnerability (CWE-415) in the Linux kernel's gtp_net_exit_batch_rtnl() function due to a flaw in how network devices are cleaned up across different network namespaces. The for_each_netdev() loop iterates network namespaces to find and destroy devices, but it can trigger the ->dellink() function twice for the same device if the device's UDP socket resides in a different namespace. This results in a double free, causing a kernel bug and system crash. The primary CWE is CWE-415 (Double Free), and a secondary CWE is CWE-401 (Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime).\nThe selection is based on the vulnerability description which states \"calling gtp_dellink() multiple times is fine unless CONFIG_DEBUG_LIST is enabled.\" This confirms that memory is being freed multiple times, leading to a double free.\nThe retriever results listed CWE-415 as the top candidate CWE, and the vulnerability description aligns with the characteristics of a double free.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-193: Off-by-one Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product calculates or uses an incorrect maximum or minimum value that is 1 more, or 1 less, than the correct value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
