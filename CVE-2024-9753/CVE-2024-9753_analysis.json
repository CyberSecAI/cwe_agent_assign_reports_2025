  "description": "Tungsten Automation Power PDF PDF File Parsing **Out-Of-Bounds Read** **Information Disclosure Vulnerability**. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Tungsten Automation Power PDF. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of PDF files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated object. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-24470.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n- The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing PDF files within Tungsten Automation Power PDF. This insufficient validation leads to a read operation that extends beyond the boundaries of an allocated object in memory.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- Out-of-bounds read: The core issue is an out-of-bounds read vulnerability, where the program attempts to access memory outside the allocated buffer during PDF parsing.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- Information Disclosure: The primary impact is the disclosure of sensitive information. By reading beyond the allocated memory, an attacker can potentially gain access to data that resides in adjacent memory regions.\n- Potential for further exploitation: The advisory mentions that this vulnerability, if combined with other vulnerabilities, could potentially allow arbitrary code execution in the context of the current process. This highlights the potential for more severe exploitation beyond just information disclosure.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- Malicious PDF files: The vulnerability is triggered by the processing of specially crafted PDF files containing malicious content designed to exploit the parsing flaw.\n- Malicious web pages: The advisory also mentions user interaction is required, suggesting that a target could be lured to a webpage that either hosts or serves a malicious PDF file for processing by the vulnerable application.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- User Interaction: Exploitation requires user interaction. The target must either open a malicious PDF file or visit a malicious page hosting a malicious file that is then processed by the vulnerable application.\n- No elevated privileges: The attacker does not appear to need any elevated privileges on the system to perform the attack; however, they must be able to get the user to open or process the malicious PDF.\n\n**Additional Notes**\n- The vulnerability is fixed in version 5.1.\n- The advisory was released on October 11th, 2024.",

The **root cause** is the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which is represented by CWE-20 [CWE-20: Improper Input Validation]. Therefore, CWE-20 [CWE-20: Improper Input Validation] is a secondary CWE.\n\nThe description states, \"The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated object.\" This clearly indicates that the **lack of proper validation** leads to the **out-of-bounds read**. The impact of this vulnerability is **information disclosure**, as mentioned in the description: \"This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information...\"\n\nI considered CWE-787 [CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write], but it is not the correct CWE because the vulnerability involves reading data past the end of an allocated object, not writing. Similarly, I considered CWE-126 [CWE-126: Buffer Over-read], but CWE-125 [CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read] is more appropriate because the description does not explicitly mention the use of buffer access mechanisms like indexes or pointers.\n\n\n## CWE Relationship Analysis\n\nCurrent CWEs represent these abstraction levels: .\n\n\n### Vulnerability Chain Analysis\n\n**Chain starting from CWE-125:**\n- 125 (Out-of-bounds Read) - ROOT\n\n\n**Chain starting from CWE-787:**\n- 787 (Out-of-bounds Write) - ROOT\n\n\n\n### CWE Relationship Diagram\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n```",
