  "description": "A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the latest version of gaizhenbiao/chuanhuchatgpt. The vulnerability is located in the filter_history function within the utils.py module. This function takes a user-provided keyword and attempts to match it against chat history filenames using a regular expression search. Due to the lack of sanitization or validation of the keyword parameter, an attacker can inject a specially crafted regular expression, leading to a denial of service condition. This can cause severe degradation of service performance and potential system unavailability.",

This leads to excessive CPU consumption, which can be viewed as a form of **resource allocation without limits or throttling** (CWE-770). The ultimate impact is a **denial of service** which can be viewed as **uncontrolled resource consumption** (CWE-400).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial analysis strongly suggests CWE-1333 as the primary weakness, given the explicit mention of \"Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)\" in the vulnerability description. The vulnerability description key phrases also include \"**weakness:** **regular expression denial of service**\" which further supports this selection.\n\nThe retriever results also give CWE-1333 the highest score.\n\nThe evidence supporting this choice is direct and compelling, providing a high level of confidence in the mapping.\n\nCWE-770 was also considered as a secondary CWE because the inefficient regular expression leads to excessive resource consumption.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, representing the root cause and a contributing factor in the vulnerability chain.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular
