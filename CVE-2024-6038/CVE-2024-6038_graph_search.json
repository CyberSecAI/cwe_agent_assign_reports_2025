The vulnerability is located in the filter_history function within the utils.py module. This function takes a user-provided keyword and attempts to match it against chat history filenames using a regular expression search. Due to the lack of sanitization or validation of the keyword parameter, an attacker can inject a specially crafted regular expression, leading to a denial of service condition. This can cause severe degradation of service performance and potential system unavailability. Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-770 CWE-1287 CWE-1333 CWE-777 CWE-674 CWE-624 CWE-185 CWE-617",
