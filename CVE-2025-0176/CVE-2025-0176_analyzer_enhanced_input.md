A vulnerability was found in code-projects Point of Sales and Inventory Management System 1.0. It has been rated as critical. This issue affects some unknown processing of the file /user/add_cart.php. The manipulation of the argument id/qty leads to **sql injection**. The attack may be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **sql injection**
- **vector:** manipulation of id/qty argument
- **product:** code-projects Point of Sales and Inventory Management System
- **version:** 1
- **component:** /user/add_cart.php

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the `add_cart.php` file of the "pos-inventory-system-in-php" project. The vulnerability stems from the fact that the `id` and `qty` parameters are directly used in an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, where attacker-controlled input can modify the intended SQL query, leading to unauthorized database access or manipulation.
- **Lack of input sanitization:** The code fails to sanitize or parameterize user-provided input before incorporating it into the database query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker could use the SQL injection vulnerability to extract sensitive data from the database such as usernames, passwords, product information, customer details, etc.
- **Data Manipulation:** It could also be used to modify or delete data in the database.
- **Privilege Escalation:** It might be possible to escalate privileges by adding a malicious user with admin permissions.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered via a POST request to `/user/add_cart.php`.
- **Request parameters**: Attackers can manipulate the `id` and `qty` parameters within the POST request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- The attacker must identify the vulnerable `add_cart.php` endpoint and parameters.
- Basic knowledge of SQL and SQL injection techniques is required.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates a standard way to exploit SQL injection, showcasing how to manipulate the `id` and `qty` parameters to send malicious SQL code to the database.
- The system is publicly accessible at the URL mentioned in the document: <https://code-projects.org/pos-inventory-system-using-php-source-code/>.

This information provides a detailed picture of the identified vulnerability and its potential impact.
