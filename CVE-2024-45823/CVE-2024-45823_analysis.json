While the vulnerability description mentions \"shared secrets across accounts\" rather than explicitly \"hard-coded credentials,\" the underlying issue is that these secrets are not unique per account, effectively functioning similarly to hard-coded credentials. The secondary CWE, CWE-289, Authentication Bypass by Alternate Name, is related to bypassing authentication.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    cwe289[\"CWE-289: Authentication Bypass by Alternate Name\"]\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe798 primary\n    class cwe289 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **shared secrets across accounts** (CWE-798). This leads to an authentication bypass (CWE-289) because an attacker can impersonate a user if they obtain the shared secret and other required authentication information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The description highlights \"**shared secrets across accounts**\" as the key factor. Although the term \"hard-coded\" isn't explicitly used, the functionality equates to using the same secret for multiple accounts.\n\nThe selection of CWE-798 is based on the evidence that the **shared secrets across accounts** are acting as hard-coded credentials. The authentication bypass (CWE-289) is a consequence of this **weakness**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nCWE-798 is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key\n**Abstraction Level**: variant\n**Similarity Score**: 4.01\n**Source**: graph\n\n**Description**:\nCWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Relationships**:\n- CANFOLLOW -> CWE-656\n- CHILDOF -> CWE-798\n- CHILDOF -> CWE-798\n- CHILDOF -> CWE-798\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-321\n\n## CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password\n**Abstraction Level**: variant\n**Similarity Score**: 4.01\n**Source**: graph\n\n**Description**:\nCWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Relationships**:\n- CANFOLLOW -> CWE-656\n- PEEROF -> CWE-257\n- PEEROF -> CWE-321\n- CHILDOF -> CWE-798\n- CHILDOF -> CWE-798\n\n## CWE-289: Authentication Bypass by Alternate Name\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 2.47\n**Source**: graph\n\n**Description**:\nCWE-289: Authentication Bypass by Alternate Name\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Relationships**:\n- CANFOLLOW -> CWE-52\n- CANFOLLOW -> CWE-46\n- CANFOLLOW -> CWE-178\n- CANFOLLOW -> CWE-173\n- CHILDOF -> CWE-1390\n\nCWE-798 is selected because of the \"**shared secrets across accounts**\" which is similar to the description \"The product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.\"\nCWE-289 is selected as an authentication bypass can result from the **shared secrets** vulnerability.\nCWE-321 and CWE-259 were considered as more specific versions of CWE-798, but they were not selected because the **shared secrets** were not explicitly passwords or cryptographic keys.\nCWE-1391 was not selected because it is a Class level CWE, and CWE-798 is a more specific Base level CWE.",
