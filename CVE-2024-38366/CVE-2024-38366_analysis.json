  "description": "trunk.cocoapods.org is the authentication server for the CoacoaPods dependency manager. The part of trunk which verifies whether a user has a real email address on signup used a rfc-822 library which executes a shell command to validate the email domain MX records validity. It works via an DNS MX. This lookup could be manipulated to also execute a command on the trunk server, effectively giving root access to the server and the infrastructure. This issue was patched server-side with commit 001cc3a430e75a16307f5fd6cdff1363ad2f40f3 in September 2023. This RCE triggered a full user-session reset, as an attacker could have used this method to write to any Podspec in trunk.",

The **weakness** is that the rfc-822 library executes a shell command to validate the email domain MX records validity using an OS command.\n2.  The rfc-822 library's `host_mx` method executes an arbitrary OS command concatenating it with the user-provided email\u2019s domain without proper validation, allowing for **command injection**.\n3.  An attacker provides a malicious email address during the registration process, specifically crafting the domain part to include command injection sequences.\n4.  This triggers the vulnerable `host` command execution through the `rfc-822` library.\n5.  The impact is that an attacker could execute arbitrary shell commands on the trunk server, potentially gaining access to environment variables, the CocoaPods/Specs repo, and the trunk database, and write to any Podspec in trunk.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence. The **weakness** is the **command injection** vulnerability in the trunk.cocoapods.org authentication server. The server used a rfc-822 library that executes a shell command to validate email domain MX records. The library's `host_mx` method executes an arbitrary OS command, concatenating it with the user-provided email's domain without proper validation. This allowed for **command injection**, enabling an attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands on the trunk server.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the final selection by showing that CWE-78 is a more specific instance of CWE-77. Given the specific nature of the vulnerability as an OS command injection, CWE-78 was chosen as the primary CWE.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-78 accurately represents the vulnerability as an OS command injection, while CWE-77 is a broader, less specific category. CWE-201 captures a potential impact of the vulnerability, where sensitive information could be inserted into sent data.\n\nCWEs considered but not used:\n*   CWE-77: Considered as a parent of CWE-78, but not used because CWE-78 is more specific.\n*   CWE-95: Ruled out as the commands are not dynamically evaluated code.\n*   CWE-88: Ruled out as the commands are not argument delimiters.\n*   CWE-1336: Ruled out as the commands are not related to a template engine.\n*   CWE-201: Considered as a secondary weakness, since the attacker could have used this method to write to any Podspec in trunk, possibly inserting sensitive information.\n*   CWE-923: Ruled out as the vulnerability does not involve restriction of a communication channel.\n*   CWE-1390: Ruled out as the vulnerability is not related to weak authentication.\n*   CWE-359: Ruled out as the vulnerability is not primarily about exposure of private personal information.\n*   CWE-184: Ruled out as the vulnerability is not related to an incomplete list of disallowed inputs.",
