## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Rootcause:** Hardcoded Cryptographic key
- **Impact:** decryption of previously encrypted user credentials
- **Product:** DLP Extension
- **Version:** 11.11.1.3

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-321 | Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key | 1.0 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE. The vulnerability description explicitly states a **Hardcoded Cryptographic key** existed. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-321, which is a variant of CWE-798. This indicates a hardcoded credential issue, but specifically focused on a cryptographic key. The variant level is appropriate here because the description explicitly mentions a cryptographic key.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **hardcoded cryptographic key** (CWE-321). This leads to the ability to decrypt previously encrypted user credentials, which is the impact.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is based on the explicit mention of a **Hardcoded Cryptographic key** in the vulnerability description. This directly maps to CWE-321, which is a variant-level CWE and thus provides sufficient specificity. The retriever results also strongly suggest CWE-321 as a primary candidate. Other CWEs like CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials) are more general and less precise given the available information. CWE-327 (Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm) is not applicable since the description does not mention the cryptographic algorithm being broken or risky, but rather that the key was **hardcoded**.
