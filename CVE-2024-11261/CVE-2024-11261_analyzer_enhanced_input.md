## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, was found in SourceCodester Student Record Management System 1.0. Affected is an unknown function of the file StudentRecordManagementSystem.cpp of the component Number of Students Menu. The manipulation leads to **memory corruption**. Attacking locally is a requirement. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **memory corruption**
- **product:** SourceCodester Student Record Management System
- **version:** 1.0
- **component:** Number of Students Menu in StudentRecordManagementSystem.cpp

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is improper input validation and handling of the input buffer in the C++ Student Record Management System. When the program expects an integer input, it doesn't properly handle non-integer characters, leading to residual characters being left in the input buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Input Validation Vulnerability:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper input validation. The program reads the integer part of a mixed input but doesn't discard the remaining characters, leaving them in the input buffer.
- **Improper Input Buffer Handling:** The program does not clear or flush the input buffer after reading an integer, leading to residual characters being processed by subsequent input operations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Integrity Issues:** Residual characters in the input buffer interfere with subsequent input operations, leading to inaccurate data entry and logical errors.
- **Unexpected Program Behavior:** Inconsistent input can cause non-deterministic logic execution, affecting the application's stability.
- **Potential for Logical Vulnerability Exploitation:** An attacker could manipulate the input to alter the application's expected behavior, potentially leading to denial of service or incorrect data processing.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through user-provided input to the program. Specifically, providing mixed character strings (e.g., "1qwe") instead of purely integer values when the program expects an integer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the program by providing input. No special privileges or network access is required.

**Additional Information:**
- The provided information includes:
    - The vulnerable code snippet which uses `cin >> n;` to read an integer.
    - Steps to reproduce the vulnerability using `gdb` debugger.
    - Screenshots demonstrating memory content before, during and after the vulnerability is exploited.
    - A suggested fix involves using `cin.clear()` and `cin.ignore()` to clear the error state and discard remaining characters in the input buffer.
    - Links to the source code and project download are provided.
- The issue was reported by Hacker0xOne on GitHub.
