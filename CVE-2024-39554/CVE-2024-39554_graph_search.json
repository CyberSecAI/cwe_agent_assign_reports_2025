Since this is a timing issue (race condition), the successful exploitation of this vulnerability is outside the attackers control. However, continued receipt and processing of this packet may create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition. On all Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved platforms with BGP multipath enabled, a specific multipath calculation removes the original next hop from the multipath lead routes nexthop-set. When this change happens, multipath relies on certain internal timing to record the update. Under certain circumstance and with specific timing, this could result in an rpd crash.
