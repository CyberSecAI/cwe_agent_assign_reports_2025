CWE-306 (Missing Authentication) and CWE-807 (Reliance on Untrusted Inputs) are considered as secondary CWEs because they might be related, but the provided description doesn't give enough details to confirm those relationships. The abstraction levels are all 'Base,' representing specific flaws.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe749[\"CWE-749: Exposed Dangerous Method or Function\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe807[\"CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\"]\n\n    cwe306 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe749\n    cwe807 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe749\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe749 primary\n    class cwe306,cwe807 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a dangerous function being exposed (CWE-749). Because of the **MISSING** authentication for this critical function (CWE-306) and/or **RELIANCE** on untrusted inputs in a security decision (CWE-807), a user can manipulate the `moneyDeposit` or `moneyWithdraw` functions. The final impact is business logic errors.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nBased on the vulnerability description, the primary issue is that the `moneyDeposit` and `moneyWithdraw` functions can be manipulated, leading to business logic errors. The functions `moneyDeposit` and `moneyWithdraw` are considered \"dangerous\" because their incorrect usage leads to business logic errors.\n\nThe description indicates that the vulnerability lies in the `moneyDeposit/moneyWithdraw` function and that the manipulation leads to business logic errors. The most fitting **ROOTCAUSE** is CWE-749 (Exposed Dangerous Method or Function). The retriever results list CWE-749 with a relatively high score, supporting this decision.\n\nCWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) and CWE-807 (Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision) were also considered as potential contributing factors. It's possible that the exposed functions lack proper authentication or rely on untrusted inputs, but there is not enough evidence to confirm this. Therefore, they are listed as secondary candidate CWEs.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly address the **ROOTCAUSE** and potential contributing factors described in the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component. Without sufficient removal or quoting of SQL syntax in user-controllable inputs, the generated SQL query can cause those inputs to be interpreted as SQL instead of ordinary user data.\n\n**Mapping

Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command,
