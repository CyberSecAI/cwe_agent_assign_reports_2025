This is a base-level CWE. It has a parent CWE of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). CWE-415 (Double Free) and CWE-416 (Use After Free) were considered as secondary candidates, representing memory management issues that could lead to memory corruption. These are variant-level CWEs.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe415[\"CWE-415: Double Free\"]\n    cwe416[\"CWE-416: Use After Free\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe415,cwe416 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with invalid input to the NPU, leading to **memory corruption**, specifically an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787). The invalid input is not explicitly classified here, but it leads to the memory corruption.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description, which mentions \"**memory corruption** while processing API calls to NPU with invalid input.\"\n\nThe retriever results list CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) as the top candidate, and the graph relationships confirm that this is a plausible root cause for memory corruption. The description aligns with CWE-787 as it involves writing data outside the intended memory boundaries due to invalid input.\n\nCWE-415 (Double Free) and CWE-416 (Use After Free) are plausible but less likely given the limited information. These could be potential consequences of the initial memory corruption or independent issues, but there isn't enough evidence to confirm them as primary factors.\n\nThe final selection focuses on CWE-787 as the primary cause, providing the most specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability based on the available evidence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25
