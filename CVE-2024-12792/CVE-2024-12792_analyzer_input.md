## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The content is related to CVE-2024-12792 and provides details regarding a SQL injection vulnerability.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by the lack of proper input validation of the 'email' parameter in the `newadmin.php` file. This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code directly into the SQL query without any sanitization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The main vulnerability is a SQL injection vulnerability. Specifically, the application fails to sanitize user-supplied input used in the 'email' parameter before constructing SQL queries, making it susceptible to injection attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to the database, leak sensitive data, tamper with existing data, gain complete system control, and cause service interruptions.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the 'email' POST parameter in the `newadmin.php` file, which is used in SQL queries without proper sanitization.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the `newadmin.php` file and inject malicious SQL code into the email parameter, making the application vulnerable without needing login or authorization.
