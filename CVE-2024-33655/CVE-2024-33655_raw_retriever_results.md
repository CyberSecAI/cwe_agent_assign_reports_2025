# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-33655
## Query
The DNS protocol in RFC 1035 and updates allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (resource consumption) by arranging for DNS queries to be accumulated for seconds, such that responses are later sent in a pulsing burst (which can be considered traffic amplification in some cases), aka the DNSBomb issue.
