CWE-400 is discouraged when more specific CWEs are available. However, given the limited information, it is difficult to pinpoint the exact resource that is being consumed. Therefore, CWE-400 is chosen at a higher level of abstraction.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe789[\"CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\"]\n\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    cwe789 -->|PARENTOF| cwe770\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe400 primary\n    class cwe770,cwe789 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **logic error** in WebKit's file handling. This leads to **uncontrolled resource consumption**, ultimately causing a denial-of-service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis pointed to several CWEs, including CWE-787 [Out-of-bounds Write], CWE-843 [Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')], and CWE-119 [Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer]. However, the vulnerability description indicates that processing web content may lead to a denial-of-service. The key phrase here is \"denial-of-service\", which aligns directly with the impact described in CWE-400 [Uncontrolled Resource Consumption].\n\nThe \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" provides further evidence, highlighting a **logic issue** in WebKit's file handling as the root cause and **denial-of-service** as the impact. The improved file handling implemented to address the issue further supports the selection of CWE-400 [Uncontrolled Resource Consumption], as resource management is directly related to file handling.\n\nThe retriever results list CWE-400 [Uncontrolled Resource Consumption] with a high density score (0.518), further supporting its relevance. While more specific CWEs like CWE-770 [Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling] exist, the available evidence doesn't pinpoint the exact resource being exhausted. Therefore, the higher-level CWE-400 [Uncontrolled Resource Consumption] is the most appropriate choice, with a confidence score of 0.8.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
