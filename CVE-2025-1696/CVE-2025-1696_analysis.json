  "description": "A vulnerability exists in Docker Desktop prior to version 4.39.0 that could lead to the unintentional disclosure of sensitive information via application logs. In affected versions, proxy configuration datapotentially including sensitive detailswas written to log files in clear text whenever an HTTP GET request was made through a proxy. An attacker with read access to these logs could obtain the proxy information and leverage it for further attacks or unauthorized access. Starting with version 4.39.0, Docker Desktop no longer logs the proxy string, thereby mitigating this risk.",

There are no parent or child relationships that significantly influence the selection in this case, as CWE-532 directly addresses the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe532[\"CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    \n    class cwe532 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain is direct: the application **logs proxy string in clear text**, leading to the unintentional disclosure of sensitive information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe primary weakness is the **logging of the proxy string in cleartext**, which directly corresponds to CWE-532. The analysis is primarily based on the provided vulnerability description and the alignment with the CWE definition.\n\nThe retriever results strongly suggest CWE-532, \"Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File,\" as the most relevant CWE. The vulnerability description explicitly states that proxy configuration data, potentially including sensitive details, was written to log files in clear text. This aligns perfectly with the CWE-532 description, which states: \"The product writes sensitive information to a log file.\" The fact that Docker Desktop mitigated this risk by no longer logging the proxy string further supports this classification. I have complete confidence in this mapping.\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of
