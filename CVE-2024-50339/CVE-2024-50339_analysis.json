While CWE-200 is a broader class, the lack of authentication is the direct cause for the information exposure in this scenario. Choosing CWE-306 provides a more precise root cause.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe306 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe306 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function**, which then leads to **CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor**. An unauthenticated user is able to retrieve session IDs because the critical function of accessing these IDs lacks proper authentication. This results in the exposure of sensitive information (session IDs) to an unauthorized actor, which can then be used to hijack sessions.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis, based on the vulnerability description and CVE details, indicates that the vulnerability stems from missing authentication. The key evidence is that an \"unauthenticated user can retrieve all the sessions IDs\". This directly aligns with **CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function**.\n\nThe Retriever Results also suggest **CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor**, which accurately reflects the impact. However, CWE-200 is discouraged as a primary mapping because it represents the impact rather than the root cause. The graph relationships highlight that CWE-306 can precede CWE-200, reinforcing the root cause/impact relationship.\n\nTherefore, the primary CWE is **CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function**, with **CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor** as a secondary CWE to represent the impact. These CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-306 being a Base level weakness and CWE-200 being a Class.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs
