  "description": "CVE-2024-38820 ensured Locale-independent, lowercase conversion for both the configured disallowedFields patterns and for request parameter names. However, there are still cases where it is possible to bypass the disallowedFields checks. Affected Spring Products and Versions Spring Framework * 6.2.0 - 6.2.6 * 6.1.0 - 6.1.19 * 6.0.0 - 6.0.27 * 5.3.0 - 5.3.42 * Older, unsupported versions are also affected Mitigation Users of affected versions should upgrade to the corresponding fixed version. Affected version(s)Fix Version Availability 6.2.x 6.2.7 OSS6.1.x 6.1.20 OSS6.0.x 6.0.28 Commercial https//enterprise.spring.io/ 5.3.x 5.3.43 Commercial https//enterprise.spring.io/ No further mitigation steps are necessary. Generally, we recommend using a dedicated model object with properties only for data binding, or using constructor binding since constructor arguments explicitly declare what to bind together with turning off setter binding through the declarativeBinding flag. See the Model Design section in the reference documentation. For setting binding, prefer the use of allowedFields (an explicit list) over disallowedFields.

CWE-668 and CWE-863 are higher-level classifications that are not as specific. CWE-184 can lead to other vulnerabilities if the list of disallowed inputs is not comprehensive, potentially exposing resources to the wrong sphere (CWE-668) or resulting in incorrect authorization (CWE-863). Therefore, the hierarchical relationships suggest that focusing on the root cause (CWE-184) is the most appropriate mapping.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe184[\"CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe668 <--|CANFOLLOW| cwe184\n    cwe863 <--|CANFOLLOW| cwe184\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe184 primary\n    class cwe668,cwe863 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **incomplete** list of disallowed fields (CWE-184). Because of this **incomplete** list, it's possible to bypass the intended security checks, which could lead to exposing resources to the wrong sphere (CWE-668) or incorrect authorization (CWE-863). The root cause is clearly the **incomplete** list, which allows the subsequent bypass.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **incomplete** list of disallowed fields. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions that \"there are still cases where it is possible to bypass the disallowedFields checks\". This directly points to a problem with the completeness of the disallowed fields list.\n\nThe retriever results suggested several CWEs, including CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization), CWE-94 (Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')), and CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere). However, these CWEs are more related to the impact of the vulnerability rather than the root cause. The most relevant CWE from the retriever results is CWE-184 (Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs), which aligns perfectly with the vulnerability description.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the decision by highlighting that CWE-184 can lead to other vulnerabilities if not properly addressed. This reinforces the importance of identifying and mitigating the root cause (CWE-184) to prevent further security issues.\n\nThe selected CWE (CWE-184) is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **incomplete** list of disallowed fields, which is the core issue. Higher-level CWEs like CWE-668 or CWE-863 would be too general and would not accurately capture the specific nature of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-917: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an expression language (EL) statement in a framework such as a Java Server Page (JSP) using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended EL statement before it is executed.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
