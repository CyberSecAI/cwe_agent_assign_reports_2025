## Vulnerability Description
An issue in parse-git-config v.3.0.0 allows an attacker to obtain sensitive information via the expandKeys function

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **component:** expandKeys function
- **product:** parse-git-config
- **impact:** obtain sensitive information, obtain sensitive information
- **attacker:** attacker
- **version:** v.3.0.0

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Root cause of vulnerability:
The `expandKeys` function in `parse-git-config` v3.0.0 is vulnerable to Prototype Pollution. An attacker can supply a payload with a `prop` and `m[2]` to introduce or modify properties within the global prototype chain.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
Prototype Pollution

Impact of exploitation:
The consequences can escalate to other injection-based attacks, potentially enabling an attacker to execute arbitrary commands within the application's context if the polluted property propagates to sensitive Node.js APIs (e.g., exec, eval).

Attack vectors:
Supplying a malicious payload with `prop` and `m[2]` to the `expandKeys` function.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
An attacker needs to be able to control the input to the `parse-git-config` library.

Mitigation or fix:
Not specified in the content.

The content provides more detail than the official CVE description, as it includes a Proof of Concept (PoC) and specific file/line number where the vulnerability exists.
