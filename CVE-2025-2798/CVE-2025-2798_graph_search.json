This is due to a misconfiguration of excluded roles during registration. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to register with an Administrator role if a custom login form is being used. This can be combined with CVE-2025-2797 to bypass the user approval process if an Administrator can be tricked into taking an action such as clicking a link. Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-639 CWE-472 CWE-285 CWE-305 CWE-425 CWE-352 CWE-306 CWE-863",
