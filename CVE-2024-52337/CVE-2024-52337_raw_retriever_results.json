This flaw allows an attacker to pass a controlled sequence of characters newlines can be inserted into the log. Instead of the evil the attacker could mimic a valid TuneD log line and trick the administrator. The quotes are usually used in TuneD logs citing raw user input, so there will always be the character ending the spoofed input, and the administrator can easily overlook this. This logged string is later used in logging and in the output of utilities, for example, `tuned-adm get_instances` or other third-party programs that use Tuneds D-Bus interface for such operations.",
