## Vulnerability Description
A log spoofing flaw was found in the Tuned package due to improper sanitization of some API arguments. This flaw allows an attacker to pass a controlled sequence of characters newlines can be inserted into the log. Instead of the evil the attacker could mimic a valid TuneD log line and trick the administrator. The quotes are usually used in TuneD logs citing raw user input, so there will always be the character ending the spoofed input, and the administrator can easily overlook this. This logged string is later used in logging and in the output of utilities, for example, `tuned-adm get_instances` or other third-party programs that use Tuneds D-Bus interface for such operations.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **improper sanitization of API arguments**
- **impact:** log spoofing
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** Tuned package

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-52337:

**Root Cause:**
The `instance_name` parameter within the `instance_create()` D-Bus method of the `tuned` daemon is not properly sanitized. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary data into the instance name string.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The primary weakness is the absence of input validation and sanitization for the `instance_name` parameter before it's used in logging and other outputs.
- **Log Spoofing:** By injecting newline characters into the `instance_name`, an attacker can create seemingly independent and legitimate-looking log entries, effectively spoofing the logs.
- **Terminal Manipulation:** Injection of terminal control sequences within the `instance_name` can influence the terminal emulators of administrators or other users who view the output.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Log Spoofing:**  Attackers can insert misleading or fabricated log entries, potentially hiding malicious activities or creating confusion.
- **Terminal Hijacking:** By injecting terminal control sequences, an attacker can potentially manipulate the terminal emulators, leading to unexpected behavior, visual deception, or denial-of-service on affected terminals. The provided PoC shows that an attacker can cause a terminal to switch to the alternate screen, thus breaking the administrator's view.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **D-Bus Interface:** The vulnerability is triggered through the `instance_create()` D-Bus method of the `tuned` daemon.
- **Local Access:**  The attacker needs to be a locally logged-in user on the system to exploit the vulnerability. Polkit allows `instance_create` method calls without authentication for locally logged-in users.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User:** The attacker must have a user account on the target system.
- **D-Bus Access:** The attacker needs to have the ability to send D-Bus messages to the `tuned` daemon.

**Additional Details:**
- This vulnerability affects `tuned` versions >= 2.23.0.
- The `instance_create()` D-Bus method was introduced in commit [cddcd233](https://github.com/redhat-performance/tuned/commit/cddcd2336944a56e313324c699dd739fe8f1f85d).
- Patches are available in `tuned` version 2.24.1 which include input sanitization using the `is_valid_name()` function.
- Red Hat has issued security advisories (RHSA-2024:10381, RHSA-2024:10384, RHSA-2024:11161, RHSA-2025:0195) to address this vulnerability in various versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
