  "reference_content": "The provided content is a commit diff from the MISP project on GitHub, specifically addressing an issue related to bookmark visibility. While it doesn't explicitly describe a vulnerability, it does highlight a fix for a problem where bookmark information was being returned in an overly verbose manner, potentially exposing user data unintentionally.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the relevant information:\n\n**Root Cause of the Issue:**\n\nThe issue stemmed from how bookmark data, particularly user information, was being handled in the `index` and `view` functions of the `BookmarksController`. The original code was returning user details even when the current user didn't have the necessary permissions to view that information.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n- **Information Disclosure:** The primary weakness was the unintentional disclosure of user information associated with bookmarks. This could occur when a user queried bookmarks using the `index` or `view` functions. Although the access control checks were in place, the user information was not being properly filtered out prior to being sent as part of the response, potentially leading to unauthorized access to PII.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n- **Unauthorized Access to User Data:**  If a malicious actor could craft requests, they could potentially gain access to the user data associated with bookmarks that they should not have access to, such as user IDs, emails, or organization IDs.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n- **API Manipulation:** An attacker could exploit the API endpoints used to fetch bookmarks (likely `/bookmarks` for `index` and `/bookmarks/{id}` for `view`) to retrieve information about bookmarks, including the user details, without proper authorization.\n- **Authenticated access:** An attacker would have to have a valid account to be able to access the API endpoints in question.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n- **Authenticated User:** The attacker would need a valid user account on the MISP system.\n- **API Knowledge:** The attacker would need some knowledge of the API endpoints used for retrieving bookmarks and their respective parameters.\n\n**Changes Made to Fix the Issue:**\n\nThe commit introduces the following key changes:\n\n1. **`index` function:** Added logic to filter user information from the results within an `afterFind` callback using `mayViewUser()` function from the `Bookmark` model.\n2. **`view` function:** Similar to the `index` function, logic to filter user information has been added within an `afterFind` callback, using the same `mayViewUser()` function.\n3. **`mayViewUser` function:** A new function `mayViewUser()` was added to the `Bookmark` model. This function checks if the current user has permission to view the user details associated with a specific bookmark based on their role (site admin, owner, or org admin) and whether the bookmark is exposed to the organization.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThis commit addresses an information disclosure vulnerability by implementing proper filtering of user data in the bookmark API endpoints. It prevents unauthorized users from accessing sensitive user information by correctly applying access controls. This is a bug fix rather than a full vulnerability disclosure.",

CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) is a class-level CWE, while CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) is a related class-level CWE. Both are children of CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) which is discouraged, indicating that a more specific CWE should be used if possible. The retriever results also suggest CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key). However, the vulnerability isn't about bypassing an authorization mechanism, but rather performing the check incorrectly leading to information exposure.\n\nCWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data) and CWE-359 (Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor) are considered as secondary CWEs as they represent the impact of the **incorrect authorization**. These are base-level CWEs.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe359[\"CWE-359: Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe201 -->|RESULT| cwe863\n    cwe359 -->|RESULT| cwe863\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe201,cwe359 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **incorrect authorization** (CWE-863). Due to the **improper restriction of access**, sensitive information is included in the data sent to the user (CWE-201) which leads to the exposure of private personal information to an unauthorized actor (CWE-359).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on authorization-related CWEs, as the vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"**does not properly restrict access**\". The retriever results pointed to several authorization-related CWEs, including CWE-863, CWE-862, and CWE-639. However, based on the evidence, the core issue is that authorization checks are present but not correctly implemented, leading to information exposure. Therefore, CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) was chosen as the primary CWE.\n\nThe commit diff highlights that user information was not being properly filtered out, leading to potential unauthorized access to PII. This leads to the consideration of CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data) and CWE-359 (Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor) as secondary CWEs, representing the impact of the **incorrect authorization**.\n\nThe final selection of CWEs reflects the root cause (CWE-863) and the resulting impact (CWE-201, CWE-359), providing a comprehensive view of the vulnerability. The chosen CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-863 being a class-level CWE and CWE-201 and CWE-359 being base-level CWEs.\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were
