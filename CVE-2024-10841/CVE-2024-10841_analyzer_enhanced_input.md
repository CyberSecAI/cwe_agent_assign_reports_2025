## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the identified vulnerabilities:

**Vulnerability 1: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**

*   **Root Cause:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `kode` parameter of the `akun_edit.php` page.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Reflective XSS vulnerability.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code that would be executed in the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement, or other malicious actions.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is a crafted URL. An attacker would need to send a link to the victim and trick them into clicking it.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL.

**Vulnerability 2: Foreground Injection (Likely related to XSS)**

*   **Root Cause:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `Proses_Kirim.php` page when processing data from `mail.php`.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The vulnerability is not explicitly stated but is described as a foreground injection vulnerability which seems to imply XSS.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker could inject malicious content or scripts through the POST parameters.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted POST request to `Proses_Kirim.php` when the victim attempts to use the form on the `mail.php` page.
*    **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**: The attacker needs to craft a malicious POST request.

**Vulnerability 3: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**

*   **Root Cause:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when editing user accounts via `Proses_Edit_Akun.php`, which allows the injected script to be stored in the database.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Stored XSS vulnerability.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Malicious JavaScript code is stored in the database.  When an administrator accesses the user list via `akun.php`, this script is executed within their browser.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is a crafted POST request to `Proses_Edit_Akun.php` by the attacker when the victim is editing the profile of a user.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to access the administrative backend and the `Proses_Edit_Akun.php` page.

**Summary:**

The document describes three XSS vulnerabilities: one reflective, one foreground injection (likely XSS), and one stored. These vulnerabilities exist in a web application called "WEB-Sekolah."  An attacker could use these to execute malicious scripts in the browsers of users (including administrators), leading to various malicious impacts.

The document provides Proof-of-Concepts (POCs) including URLs and POST requests to demonstrate the vulnerabilities.
