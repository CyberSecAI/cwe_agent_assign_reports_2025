  "description": "A vulnerability classified as critical was found in romadebrian WEB-Sekolah 1.0. Affected by this vulnerability is an unknown functionality of the file /Proses_Kirim.php of the component Mail Handler. The manipulation of the argument Name leads to **sql injection**. The attack can be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. Other parameters might be affected as well.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the identified vulnerabilities:\n\n**Vulnerability 1: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**\n\n*   **Root Cause:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `kode` parameter of the `akun_edit.php` page.\n*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Reflective XSS vulnerability.\n*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code that would be executed in the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement, or other malicious actions.\n*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is a crafted URL. An attacker would need to send a link to the victim and trick them into clicking it.\n*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL.\n\n**Vulnerability 2: Foreground Injection (Likely related to XSS)**\n\n*   **Root Cause:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `Proses_Kirim.php` page when processing data from `mail.php`.\n*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The vulnerability is not explicitly stated but is described as a foreground injection vulnerability which seems to imply XSS.\n*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker could inject malicious content or scripts through the POST parameters.\n*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted POST request to `Proses_Kirim.php` when the victim attempts to use the form on the `mail.php` page.\n*    **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**: The attacker needs to craft a malicious POST request.\n\n**Vulnerability 3: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**\n\n*   **Root Cause:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when editing user accounts via `Proses_Edit_Akun.php`, which allows the injected script to be stored in the database.\n*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Stored XSS vulnerability.\n*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Malicious JavaScript code is stored in the database.  When an administrator accesses the user list via `akun.php`, this script is executed within their browser.\n*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is a crafted POST request to `Proses_Edit_Akun.php` by the attacker when the victim is editing the profile of a user.\n*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to access the administrative backend and the `Proses_Edit_Akun.php` page.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe document describes three XSS vulnerabilities: one reflective, one foreground injection (likely XSS), and one stored. These vulnerabilities exist in a web application called \"WEB-Sekolah.\"  An attacker could use these to execute malicious scripts in the browsers of users (including administrators), leading to various malicious impacts.\n\nThe document provides Proof-of-Concepts (POCs) including URLs and POST requests to demonstrate the vulnerabilities.",
