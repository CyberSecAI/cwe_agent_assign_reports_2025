## Vulnerability Description
ConnectWise-Password-Encryption-Utility.exe in ConnectWise Risk Assessment allows an attacker to extract a **hardcoded AES decryption key** via reverse engineering. This key is embedded in plaintext within the binary and used in cryptographic operations without dynamic key management. Once obtained the key can be used to decrypt CSV input files used for authenticated network scanning.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **hardcoded AES decryption key**
- **weakness:** **plaintext key**
- **impact:** decrypt CSV input files
- **vector:** reverse engineering
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** ConnectWise Risk Assessment
- **component:** ConnectWise-Password-Encryption-Utility.exe
