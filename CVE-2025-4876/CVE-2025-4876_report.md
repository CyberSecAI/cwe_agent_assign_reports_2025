# Analysis Report for CVE-2025-4876

# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2025-4876

## Description

ConnectWise-Password-Encryption-Utility.exe in ConnectWise Risk Assessment allows an attacker to extract a **hardcoded AES decryption key** via reverse engineering. This key is embedded in plaintext within the binary and used in cryptographic operations without dynamic key management. Once obtained the key can be used to decrypt CSV input files used for authenticated network scanning.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Rootcause:** hardcoded AES decryption key
- **Weakness:** plaintext key
- **Impact:** decrypt CSV input files
- **Vector:** reverse engineering
- **Attacker:** attacker
- **Product:** ConnectWise Risk Assessment
- **Component:** ConnectWise-Password-Encryption-Utility.exe

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-321 | Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key | 1.0 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-312 | Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship identified is that CWE-321 is a variant of CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials), indicating a more specific case of using hardcoded credentials where the credential is a cryptographic key. Also, there is a potential chain relationship as the hardcoded key leads to cleartext storage (CWE-312) because it is used to decrypt the data. The abstraction levels influenced the selection, preferring the more specific Variant level for the root cause (CWE-321) and Base level for the impact (CWE-312).

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **hardcoded AES decryption key** (CWE-321). This leads to the ability to decrypt CSV input files, effectively resulting in **cleartext storage of sensitive information** (CWE-312) if the decrypted data is not properly handled.
  - CWE-321 (Root Cause): **Hardcoded AES decryption key**
  - CWE-312 (Impact): Decrypted CSV input files leading to **cleartext storage of sensitive information**

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is primarily based on the vulnerability description, which clearly states the presence of a **hardcoded AES decryption key**. The retriever results also strongly suggest CWE-321 as a potential match. The relationship analysis confirms that CWE-321 is a specific case of hardcoded credentials. The vulnerability description key phrases identify "**hardcoded AES decryption key**" as rootcause and "**plaintext key**" as the weakness.

The choice of CWE-321 is based on the explicit mention of a **hardcoded cryptographic key** being the root cause. The high similarity scores in the retriever results support this selection. The selection is at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-321 is a Variant, which is preferred for root cause analysis.

CWE-311, while initially considered due to the lack of encryption, is not the primary issue. The main problem is the presence and use of a **hardcoded key**, not the complete absence of encryption. The evidence supports the hardcoded key being the core issue, making CWE-321 a more precise fit. Once the key is obtained, the cleartext storage becomes possible, thus CWE-312 is a secondary weakness.
