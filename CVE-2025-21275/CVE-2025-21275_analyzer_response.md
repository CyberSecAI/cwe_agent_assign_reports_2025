## Vulnerability Chain
The chain of vulnerability starts with an **incorrect privilege assignment** (CWE-266), leading to an elevation of privilege.
- Root cause: CWE-266 (Incorrect Privilege Assignment)
- Impact: Elevation of Privilege

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is based on the limited information provided in the vulnerability description. The key phrase "Elevation of Privilege" suggests that a privilege issue exists, and the guidance indicates that the underlying cause should be identified rather than just the impact. CWE-266 best describes the root cause of the vulnerability as it involves an **incorrect assignment of privileges**, leading to an unintended level of control.

The decision to choose CWE-266 is based on the guidance provided, which indicates that when there is an "Elevation of Privilege", then the root cause should be identified instead of just the impact.
