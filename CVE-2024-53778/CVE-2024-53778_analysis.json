The specific impact varies case by case.\n- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious website to trigger the unintended action.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need to be authenticated but needs to find a way to get a logged-in user to perform an action.",

Improper validation of data that are user-controllable can lead to the application processing incorrect, and often malicious, input.\n\n\nFor example, custom cookies commonly store session data or persistent data across sessions. This kind of session data is normally involved in security related decisions on the server side, such as user authentication and access control. Thus, the cookies might contain sensitive data such as user credentials and privileges. This is a dangerous practice, as it can often lead to improper reliance on the value of the client-provided cookie by the server side application.\n",
