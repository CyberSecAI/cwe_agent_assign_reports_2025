# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-34750

## Vulnerability Description
Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions, Uncontrolled Resource Consumption vulnerability in Apache Tomcat. When processing an HTTP/2 stream, Tomcat did not handle some cases of excessive HTTP headers correctly. This led to a miscounting of active HTTP/2 streams which in turn led to the use of an incorrect infinite timeout which allowed connections to remain open which should have been closed. This issue affects Apache Tomcat from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.0-M20, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.24, from 9.0.0-M1 through 9.0.89. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 11.0.0-M21, 10.1.25 or 9.0.90, which fixes the issue.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-34750:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within Apache Tomcat versions 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.0-M20, 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.24, and 9.0.0-M1 through 9.0.89. The specific nature of the flaw is not detailed in this advisory, but it is related to how these versions handle certain requests or data, leading to a denial of service.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The primary vulnerability is a flaw in Apache Tomcat that can be exploited to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition. This would likely result in the affected application or system being unavailable to legitimate users.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is network-based (AV:N) which means a remote attacker can initiate the attack.
*   The attack does not require special privileges (PR:N), meaning no authentication is required to exploit it.
*   No user interaction is required (UI:N).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable Apache Tomcat instance. No special privileges or user interactions are necessary, thus this is exploitable over the network by any unauthenticated user.
