Potential for other injection-based attacks if the polluted property propagates to sensitive Node.js APIs (e.g., exec, eval), potentially enabling arbitrary command execution.\n\nAttack vectors:\nSupplying a payload with an `Object.prototype` setter to the `lib.Logger` function.\n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position:\nAn attacker needs to be able to control the input to the `lib.Logger` function.\n\nMitigation or fix:\nThe advisory does not specify a fix, but suggests input validation to prevent modification of the `Object.prototype`.\n\nThe content provides more detail than the official CVE description.\n\nCVE-2024-57075 is related to this content.",

An attacker injects a crafted payload, leading to prototype pollution. This pollution can then result in **CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption)**, manifesting as a Denial of Service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on strong evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference links. The description explicitly mentions \"**prototype pollution**\" as the root cause. The CVE reference summary further details the lack of proper input validation, which allows modification of the `Object.prototype`. The primary CWE, **CWE-1321**, directly addresses this weakness. **CWE-400** is considered as a secondary CWE because the impact of the prototype pollution is Denial of Service.\n\nThe selection of **CWE-1321** is at the optimal level of specificity as it's a variant-level CWE that accurately describes the **prototype pollution** vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1321: Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component that specifies attributes that are to be initialized or updated in an object, but it does not properly control modifications of attributes of the object prototype.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-204: Observable Response Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product provides different responses to incoming requests in a way that reveals internal state information to an unauthorized actor outside of the intended control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1286: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input that is expected to be well-formed - i.e., to comply with a certain syntax - but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input complies with the syntax.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-617: Reachable Assertion\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains an assert() or similar statement that can be triggered by an attacker, which leads to an application exit or other behavior that is more severe than necessary.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
