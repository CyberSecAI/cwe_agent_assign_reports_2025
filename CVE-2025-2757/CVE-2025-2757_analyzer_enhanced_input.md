## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability classified as critical was found in Open Asset Import Library Assimp 5.4.3. This vulnerability affects the function AI_MD5_PARSE_STRING_IN_QUOTATION of the file code/AssetLib/MD5/MD5Parser.cpp of the component MD5 File Handler. The manipulation of the argument data leads to **heap-based buffer overflow**. The attack can be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **heap-based buffer overflow**
- **product:** Open Asset Import Library Assimp
- **version:** 5.4.3
- **component:** AI_MD5_PARSE_STRING_IN_QUOTATION in code/AssetLib/MD5/MD5Parser.cpp

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
```text
The provided content relates to CVE-2025-2757.

The content describes a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the AI_MD5_PARSE_STRING_IN_QUOTATION function within the Assimp library, which can be exploited by providing a malformed MD5 file.

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The code in `code/AssetLib/MD5/MD5Parser.cpp:302` does not validate the boundary of `sz`, allowing an attacker to write arbitrary data and size.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Heap-based buffer overflow in `AI_MD5_PARSE_STRING_IN_QUOTATION`.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability to cause a remote code execution if they can trick the victim into running assimp on a malformed MD5 file.
*   **Attack vectors:** An attacker can craft a malicious MD5 file and trick a user into opening it with a vulnerable version of assimp.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious MD5 file to a user who will open it using a vulnerable version of the Assimp library.
*   **Mitigation or fix:** The content does not provide a fix.
