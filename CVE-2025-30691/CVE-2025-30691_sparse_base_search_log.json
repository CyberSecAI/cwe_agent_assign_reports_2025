  "query": "Vulnerability in Oracle Java SE (component Compiler). Supported versions that are affected are Oracle Java SE 21.0.6, 24 Oracle GraalVM for JDK 21.0.6 and 24. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Oracle Java SE. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Oracle Java SE accessible data as well as unauthorized read access to a subset of Oracle Java SE accessible data. Note This vulnerability can be exploited by using APIs in the specified Component, e.g., through a web service which supplies data to the APIs. This vulnerability also applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. CVSS 3.1 Base Score 4.8 (Confidentiality and Integrity impacts). CVSS Vector (CVSS3.1/AVN/ACH/PRN/UIN/SU/CL/IL/AN).",
