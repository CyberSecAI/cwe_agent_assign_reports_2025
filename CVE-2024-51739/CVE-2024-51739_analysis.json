As a fix the sentence displayed after resetting password no longer shows if the user exists or not. This fix is included in versions 2.7.11, 3.0.5, 3.1.2, and 3.2.0. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may overload the dictionary entry `UIResetPwd-Error-WrongLogin` through an extension and replace it with a generic message.",

The application **incorrectly** implements the password reset functionality.\n2.  This leads to an **Observable Response Discrepancy (CWE-204)**, where the response indicates whether a user exists.\n3.  This allows for **users enumeration**, making brute-force attacks easier.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe primary weakness is CWE-204, as the application's password reset functionality reveals whether a user exists or not based on the message displayed. The evidence is strong, with the CVE summary explicitly stating \"User enumeration vulnerability through the password reset mechanism.\" The fix described also directly addresses this issue by ensuring a generic message is displayed regardless of user existence.\n\nThe other CWEs were considered, but were ultimately less precise. CWE-203 is a broader category, and CWE-209 focuses on error messages, while the discrepancy occurs regardless of whether it's an error.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-204 accurately capturing the nature of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this
