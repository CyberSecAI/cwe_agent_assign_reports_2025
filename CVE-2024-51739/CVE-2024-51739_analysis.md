# Analysis for CVE-2024-51739

# Summary

| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-204 | Observable Response Discrepancy | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE. The application reveals user existence via different responses. |
| CWE-203 | Observable Discrepancy | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary candidate. A more general case of CWE-204. |
| CWE-209 | Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary candidate. The sensitive information is whether a username exists. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis

The primary weakness is CWE-204, which is a more specific case of CWE-203. CWE-209 is also related, as the different responses are a form of sensitive information leakage.

## Vulnerability Chain

The vulnerability chain is relatively simple:

1.  The application **incorrectly** implements the password reset functionality.
2.  This leads to an **Observable Response Discrepancy (CWE-204)**, where the response indicates whether a user exists.
3.  This allows for **users enumeration**, making brute-force attacks easier.

## Summary of Analysis

The primary weakness is CWE-204, as the application's password reset functionality reveals whether a user exists or not based on the message displayed. The evidence is strong, with the CVE summary explicitly stating "User enumeration vulnerability through the password reset mechanism." The fix described also directly addresses this issue by ensuring a generic message is displayed regardless of user existence.

The other CWEs were considered, but were ultimately less precise. CWE-203 is a broader category, and CWE-209 focuses on error messages, while the discrepancy occurs regardless of whether it's an error.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-204 accurately capturing the nature of the vulnerability.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-204: Observable Response Discrepancy
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product provides different responses to incoming requests in a way that reveals internal state information to an unauthorized actor outside of the intended control sphere.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-620: Unverified Password Change
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
When setting a new password for a user, the product does not require knowledge of the original password, or using another form of authentication.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product generates an error message that includes sensitive information about its environment, users, or associated data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-294: Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A capture-replay flaw exists when the design of the product makes it possible for a malicious user to sniff network traffic and bypass authentication by replaying it to the server in question to the same effect as the original message (or with minor changes).

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
