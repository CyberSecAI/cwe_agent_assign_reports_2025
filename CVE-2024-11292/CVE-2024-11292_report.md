# Analysis Report for CVE-2024-11292

# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-11292

## Description

The WP Private Content Plus plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to **Sensitive Information Exposure** in all versions up to, and including, 3.6.1 via the WordPress core search feature. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to extract sensitive data from posts that have been restricted to higher-level roles such as administrator.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Weakness:** Sensitive Information Exposure
- **Impact:** extract sensitive data
- **Attacker:** unauthenticated attackers
- **Product:** WP Private Content Plus plugin for WordPress
- **Version:** all versions up to and including 3.6.1
- **Component:** WordPress core search feature

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary

| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-200 | Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor | 0.9 | Class | Allowed | The plugin fails to adequately prevent the WordPress core search feature from exposing the content of posts that are meant to be restricted, leading to **Sensitive Information Exposure**. |
| CWE-862 | Missing Authorization | 0.7 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | The plugin's access controls are not robust enough to handle search queries, allowing unauthenticated users to view content they should not have access to. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that impacted my decision was the parent-child relationship. CWE-200 is a class-level CWE, and while more specific CWEs exist, none precisely capture the nuance of sensitive information exposure due to **insufficient access control** in the search functionality. CWE-862 describes a scenario where authorization checks are missing, and it is related to the **Content Restriction Bypass**.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **insufficient access control** within the WP Private Content Plus plugin when handling WordPress's core search feature, leading to a **Content Restriction Bypass** which culminates in the **Exposure of Sensitive Information** to unauthenticated attackers.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis focused on the **Sensitive Information Exposure** resulting from the plugin's failure to properly restrict content access during search queries. The evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE Reference Links Content Summary clearly indicates that the plugin does not adequately prevent unauthorized access to restricted content through the WordPress search feature.

The assessment is heavily based on the provided evidence. The "Vulnerability Description Key Phrases" highlight the **weakness** as "Sensitive Information Exposure." The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" explicitly states that the "vulnerability stems from the WP Private Content Plus plugin not properly restricting access to content when using WordPress's built-in search functionality." It also notes the "**Insufficient Access Control:** The plugin's access controls are not robust enough to handle search queries, allowing unauthenticated users to view content they should not have access to."

The relationship analysis reinforces the selection of CWE-200 as the primary weakness, with CWE-862 representing a contributing factor due to the **missing authorization** checks.

CWE-200 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly describes the **sensitive information exposure**, while CWE-862 describes the **missing authorization** contributing to the exposure.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
**Abstraction Level**: Compound
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.

## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
