## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The content relates to a different CVE (CVE-2024-12014) than the one specified (CVE-2025-4762). However, it provides detailed vulnerability information.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper implementation of security controls in the eSignaViewer component. Specifically, issues stem from Path Traversal and Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Path Traversal:** Attackers can craft malicious file paths to access restricted files.
*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** Insufficient authorization checks on user-controlled object references (e.g., document IDs) allow attackers to bypass permissions and access unauthorized resources.

**Impact of exploitation:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data and potential regulatory violations.

**Attack vectors:** Manipulation of inputs such as file paths and object identifiers. No authentication is required for exploitation.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** No specific capabilities or position are mentioned, implying a relatively low barrier to entry for attackers.

**Mitigation or fix:**
*   Upgrade to patched versions:
    *   1.3.2
    *   1.4.4
    *   4.0.4
    *   4.1.4
    *   5.0.2
    *   5.1.2
    *   5.2.4
    *   5.3.3
    *   5.4.1
*   Implement stronger input validation.
*   Implement robust authorization controls.
*   Adopt complementary security measures: logging suspicious activities, regular security audits, and monitoring for signs of potential exploitation.

The content provides more detail than the official CVE description would likely contain, specifically listing affected and fixed versions, and detailing the root cause and mitigation steps.
