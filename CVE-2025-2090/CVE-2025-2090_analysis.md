# Analysis for CVE-2025-2090

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-284 | Improper Access Control | 1 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | 0.7 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is **improper access control** (CWE-284), which is a fundamental security flaw. The vulnerability occurs because the system **lacks verification of user session identity**, allowing low-privileged users to add sub-administrators. This is related to **missing authentication** (CWE-306) since proper authentication would establish the user's identity before granting privileges.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of user session identity verification**, which leads to **missing authentication**. This **missing authentication** directly causes the **improper access control**, allowing unauthorized users to perform administrative actions.

## Summary of Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-284 (Improper Access Control). The vulnerability description and the CVE reference summary clearly state that the root cause is the **improper access controls** due to the **lack of verification of user session identity**. This allows low-privileged users to perform actions they should not be authorized to do, such as adding sub-administrators. CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) is a secondary CWE, as the **missing authentication** is a prerequisite for the **improper access control** to occur.

The evidence for CWE-284 is found in the "Vulnerability Description Key Phrases" section, which states: "**rootcause:** **improper access controls**". Further evidence is in the "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" section, which states: "due to the **lack of verification of user session identity** in request verification, resulting in low privileged users being able to successfully send requests to add sub administrators directly."

The abstraction level for both CWE-284 and CWE-306 is Base, which is the preferred level.

Other CWEs Considered:
*   CWE-425 (Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')): Similar to CWE-284, but CWE-284 more directly addresses the **improper access control**.
*   CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key): Not applicable because the vulnerability does not involve modification of a key value.
*   CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function): Considered as a secondary CWE because the **lack of authentication** is a prerequisite for the **improper access control**.
*   CWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')): Not relevant, as there is no mention of SQL injection in the description.
*   CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')): Not relevant, as there is no mention of cross-site scripting in the description.
*   CWE-434 (Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type): Not relevant, as there is no mention of file uploads in the description.
*   CWE-73 (External Control of File Name or Path): Not relevant, as there is no mention of file name or path manipulation in the description.
