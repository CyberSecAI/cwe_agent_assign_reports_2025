  "description": "Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. In affected versions if a Next.js application is performing authorization in middleware based on pathname, it was possible for this authorization to be bypassed for pages directly under the applications root directory. For example * [Not affected] `https//example.com/` * [Affected] `https//example.com/foo` * [Not affected] `https//example.com/foo/bar`. This issue is patched in Next.js `14.2.15` and later. If your Next.js application is hosted on Vercel, this vulnerability has been automatically mitigated, regardless of Next.js version. There are no official workarounds for this vulnerability.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-51479\n\n**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from how Next.js applications were handling authorization in middleware based on the pathname.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n- **Authorization Bypass:** It was possible to bypass authorization checks if they were implemented in middleware based on pathname. This means that unauthorized users could potentially gain access to protected resources by manipulating the request in a way not properly handled by the middleware.\n- **Inadequate Pathname Handling:** The underlying cause is related to how Next.js processes or interprets pathnames, leading to potential bypass scenarios.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker could bypass intended authorization mechanisms, gaining access to protected resources or functionalities without proper authentication.\n- **Confidentiality Violation:** Exploiting this vulnerability could result in the exposure of sensitive data. Though the CVSS metrics rate confidentiality impact as high, integrity and availability are none.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.\n- **Pathname manipulation:** The attack likely involves crafting specific requests with manipulated pathnames, which the vulnerable middleware fails to process correctly.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **No privileges are required.** The attacker does not need any pre-existing access to the system.\n- **No user interaction is required.** The attacker does not need to trick a user into performing any actions to exploit the vulnerability.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The vulnerability affects Next.js versions `9.5.5` up to and including `14.2.14`.\n- The vulnerability was fixed in version `14.2.15`\n- Vercel deployments are automatically mitigated, regardless of the Next.js version used.\n- The vulnerability was reported by tyage (GMO CyberSecurity by IERAE).\n- The CVSS score is 7.5, with a high confidentiality impact\n\nThe provided information is more descriptive than a typical CVE, providing details about the vulnerable versions, patch version, mitigation and the specific component affected by the vulnerability.",

Since the vulnerability description clearly indicates that an authorization check is present but flawed, CWE-863 is the more specific and appropriate choice over the more generic CWE-284.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain consists of the following:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Incorrect Authorization** (CWE-863): The application's middleware has a flaw in its authorization logic when handling pathnames directly under the application's root directory.\n2.  **Impact:** Authorization Bypass: Due to the flawed authorization, an attacker can bypass the intended authorization checks.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis considered several CWEs, but the final conclusion focuses on CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) as the primary weakness. This decision is based on a thorough review of the vulnerability description and the available CWE specifications. The vulnerability description clearly states that the authorization in middleware based on pathname can be bypassed due to a flaw in how Next.js applications handle pathnames.\n\nThe evidence from the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section supports this conclusion:\n- \"**Authorization Bypass:** It was possible to bypass authorization checks if they were implemented in middleware based on pathname.\"\n- \"**Inadequate Pathname Handling:** The underlying cause is related to how Next.js processes or interprets pathnames, leading to potential bypass scenarios.\"\n\nThe graph relationships show that CWE-863 is a child of CWE-284 (Improper Access Control), but CWE-863 is the more specific choice because the vulnerability involves a flawed authorization check rather than a general access control issue. This specificity ensures that the CWE mapping accurately reflects the nature of the vulnerability.\n\nThe selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because it clearly identifies the **incorrect authorization** as the root cause of the vulnerability, aligning with the technical details provided in the vulnerability description.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
