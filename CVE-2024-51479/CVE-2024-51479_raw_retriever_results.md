# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-51479
## Query
Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. In affected versions if a Next.js application is performing authorization in middleware based on pathname, it was possible for this authorization to be bypassed for pages directly under the applications root directory. For example * [Not affected] `https//example.com/` * [Affected] `https//example.com/foo` * [Not affected] `https//example.com/foo/bar`. This issue is patched in Next.js `14.2.15` and later. If your Next.js application is hosted on Vercel, this vulnerability has been automatically mitigated, regardless of Next.js version. There are no official workarounds for this vulnerability.
