While other CWEs related to cookie security were considered, CWE-1004 specifically addresses the **missing HTTPOnly flag**, which aligns perfectly with the vulnerability description.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1004[\"CWE-1004: Sensitive Cookie Without 'HttpOnly' Flag\"]\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    \n    cwe1004 -->|PeerOf| cwe614[\"CWE-614: Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute\"]\n    cwe1004 -->|CHILDOF| cwe319\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1004 primary\n    class cwe319 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper configuration of the HTTPOnly flag** on a sensitive cookie (CWE-1004). This **weakness** leads to a potential exposure of sensitive information transmitted in cleartext (CWE-319) if the cookie contains sensitive data. The chain is: **Missing HTTPOnly Flag (CWE-1004) -> Potential Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information (CWE-319)**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-1004 as the primary candidate due to its direct relevance to the **missing HTTPOnly flag** on cookies. The retriever results and vulnerability description both strongly support this classification. The vulnerability description explicitly states \" **does not properly set the HTTPOnly flag for cookies**\". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this: \"The Netgear WNR614 router **does not properly set the HTTPOnly** and Secure flags for cookies.\" The root cause is clearly the **missing HTTPOnly flag**.\n\nCWE-319 was considered because a cookie without the HTTPOnly flag can potentially be intercepted and its contents exposed if transmitted in cleartext. However, this is a secondary concern and represents a potential consequence rather than the primary root cause. Therefore, it's a secondary candidate.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-1004 is a Variant, which is preferred, and accurately reflects the specific **weakness** of a **missing HTTPOnly flag**. While CWE-319 is a Base class, it describes the potential impact rather than the root cause.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as
