# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-11048

## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability was found in D-Link DI-8003 16.07.16A1. It has been rated as critical. Affected by this issue is the function dbsrv_asp of the file /dbsrv.asp. The manipulation of the argument str leads to **stack-based buffer overflow**. The attack may be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **stack-based buffer overflow**
- **vector:** manipulation of str argument
- **product:** D-Link DI-8003
- **version:** 16.07.16A1
- **component:** dbsrv_asp in /dbsrv.asp

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a stack buffer overflow vulnerability in the `dbsrv_asp` service of the D-Link DI-8003 router.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Stack Overflow:** A stack buffer overflow is present, triggered by an excessively long string being processed by the `dbsrv_asp` service.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Service crash:** The overflow causes the `dbsrv` service to crash due to the stack corruption.
- **Potential for further exploitation:** Although not explicitly stated in the provided content, stack overflows can potentially be leveraged for arbitrary code execution on the device.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending an overly long string to the vulnerable service. The exact method of sending this string is not described, but it likely involves interacting with a service or interface that handles user input and passes it to `dbsrv_asp`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send data to the affected service. This likely requires network access to the device on the local network or remotely if the device is exposed. The provided information doesn't specify whether authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability.
