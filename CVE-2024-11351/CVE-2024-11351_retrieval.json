This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to extract sensitive data from posts that have been restricted to higher-level roles such as administrator.', key_phrases={'rootcause': 'WordPress core search feature', 'weakness': ['Sensitive Information Exposure', 'information disclosure'], 'impact': 'extract sensitive data', 'vector': '', 'attacker': 'unauthenticated attackers', 'product': ['Restrict membership', 'site', 'content and user access plugin for WordPress'], 'version': 'all versions up to and including 2.2.8', 'component': ''}, reference_content='Based on the provided content, here\\'s a breakdown of the vulnerability:\\n\\n**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-11351\\n\\n**Vulnerability Description:**\\n\\nThe \"Restrict \u2013 membership, site, content and user access restrictions for WordPress\" plugin, in versions up to and including 2.2.8, is vulnerable to a content restriction bypass. This vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers to access sensitive content that is supposed to be restricted to higher-level users like administrators through the WordPress core search feature.\\n\\n**Root Cause:**\\n\\nThe plugin failed to properly restrict access to content when using the WordPress search functionality.  It did not account for the WordPress core search, which revealed restricted content in search results.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\\n\\n- **Inadequate Content Restriction:** The plugin\\'s access control mechanisms were bypassed by the WordPress core search functionality.\\n- **Sensitive Information Exposure:**  Restricted content, including potentially sensitive data meant only for specific roles (e.g., administrators), was exposed to unauthenticated users via search results.\\n\\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\\n\\n- **Sensitive Data Leakage:** Unauthorized users could gain access to restricted content, potentially exposing confidential information. This could include data intended for administrators or specific user roles.\\n\\n**Attack Vectors:**\\n\\n- **WordPress Core Search:** The vulnerability is triggered by using the standard WordPress search functionality.\\n\\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\\n\\n- **Unauthenticated Access:** Attackers do not need to be logged in or have any specific privileges to exploit this vulnerability.\\n- **Knowledge of the target site:** Attacker needs knowledge of a vulnerable site using the plugin and how the search function works on the website.\\n\\n**Additional Notes:**\\n\\n*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.2.9 of the plugin by adding a filter to the `pre_get_posts` hook, modifying the search query to exclude restricted content.\\n*   The Wordfence article includes a CVSS score of 5.3 (Medium) with the vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N\\n*   The provided patch details show that the fix involves adding a `restrict_search` function that filters out posts that are not available to the \\'everyone\\' role or don\\'t have a restriction set at all.\\n\\nThis information provides a comprehensive understanding of the vulnerability described in CVE-2024-11351.', similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {}, 'top_cwes_by_threshold': {}}},
