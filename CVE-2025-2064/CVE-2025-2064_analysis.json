  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-2064 Content\n\nThis content **RELATES** to a SQL injection vulnerability. It provides more detail than a standard CVE description would.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the extracted information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\n*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient user input validation of the `recipt_no` parameter in the `/deletePayment.php?recipt_no=1` file. The application directly uses this parameter in SQL queries without proper cleaning or validation.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   SQL Injection\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   Unauthorized database access\n*   Sensitive data leakage\n*   Data tampering\n*   Comprehensive system control\n*   Service interruption\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   The vulnerability is exploitable via the `recipt_no` GET parameter in the `/deletePayment.php?recipt_no=1` URL.\n*   No login or authorization is required to exploit the vulnerability.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   An attacker needs to be able to craft malicious SQL queries and send them as the `recipt_no` parameter in a GET request. No authentication is required.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   **Use prepared statements and parameter binding:** This separates SQL code from user input.\n*   **Input validation and filtering:**  Strictly validate and filter user input.\n*   **Minimize database user permissions:** Use accounts with the least necessary privileges.\n*   **Regular security audits:** Conduct regular code and system security audits.\n\n**Payload Examples:**\n\n*   `recipt_no=1' AND GTID_SUBSET(CONCAT(0x71706b6271,(SELECT (ELT(8273=8273,1))),0x716a6b7071),8273)-- EsAG` (error-based)\n*   `recipt_no=1' AND 5182=BENCHMARK(5000000,MD5(0x6a78426e))-- HKDH` (time-based blind)\n\n**Affected Software:**\n\n*   Life Insurance Management System in PHP V1.0\n*   Software Link: <https://projectworlds.in/life-insurance-management-system-in-php/>\n\n**Vulnerable File:**\n\n*   `/deletePayment.php?recipt_no=1`",

CWE-74 is a class level CWE, which is a more general form of injection. The retriever results also favored CWE-89 with the highest score.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    cwe89 -- CHILDOF --> cwe74\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe89 primary\n    class cwe74 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain starts with the **improper neutralization** of the `recipt_no` parameter which leads to **SQL Injection**, and finally results in unauthorized database access, sensitive data leakage, or other impacts.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability is clearly an SQL injection vulnerability due to the **improper neutralization** of the `recipt_no` parameter in the `/deletePayment.php` file. The application fails to sanitize this input before using it in an SQL query, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.\n\nThe evidence for this is strong, coming from both the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary. The summary explicitly states: \"The vulnerability stems from insufficient user input validation of the `recipt_no` parameter in the `/deletePayment.php?recipt_no=1` file. The application directly uses this parameter in SQL queries without proper cleaning or validation.\"\n\nThe selection of CWE-89 is based on the precise match to the vulnerability, its Base level abstraction, and the explicit mention of SQL injection. The retriever results also gave it the highest score.\n\nCWE-74 was considered as it is a parent of CWE-89, but it is too general. While SQL Injection is a type of injection, CWE-89 provides a more accurate and specific classification. The MITRE mapping guidance discourages the use of CWE-74 when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate, solidifying the choice of CWE-89.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.
