## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-2064 Content

This content **RELATES** to a SQL injection vulnerability. It provides more detail than a standard CVE description would.

Here's a breakdown of the extracted information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient user input validation of the `recipt_no` parameter in the `/deletePayment.php?recipt_no=1` file. The application directly uses this parameter in SQL queries without proper cleaning or validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   SQL Injection

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Unauthorized database access
*   Sensitive data leakage
*   Data tampering
*   Comprehensive system control
*   Service interruption

**Attack vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is exploitable via the `recipt_no` GET parameter in the `/deletePayment.php?recipt_no=1` URL.
*   No login or authorization is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to craft malicious SQL queries and send them as the `recipt_no` parameter in a GET request. No authentication is required.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   **Use prepared statements and parameter binding:** This separates SQL code from user input.
*   **Input validation and filtering:**  Strictly validate and filter user input.
*   **Minimize database user permissions:** Use accounts with the least necessary privileges.
*   **Regular security audits:** Conduct regular code and system security audits.

**Payload Examples:**

*   `recipt_no=1' AND GTID_SUBSET(CONCAT(0x71706b6271,(SELECT (ELT(8273=8273,1))),0x716a6b7071),8273)-- EsAG` (error-based)
*   `recipt_no=1' AND 5182=BENCHMARK(5000000,MD5(0x6a78426e))-- HKDH` (time-based blind)

**Affected Software:**

*   Life Insurance Management System in PHP V1.0
*   Software Link: <https://projectworlds.in/life-insurance-management-system-in-php/>

**Vulnerable File:**

*   `/deletePayment.php?recipt_no=1`
