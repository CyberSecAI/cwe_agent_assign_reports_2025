## Query
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved NFS fix nfs_release_folio() to not deadlock via kcompactd writeback Add PF_KCOMPACTD flag and current_is_kcompactd() helper to check for it so nfs_release_folio() can skip calling nfs_wb_folio() from kcompactd. Otherwise NFS can deadlock waiting for kcompactd enduced writeback which recurses back to NFS (which triggers writeback to NFSD via NFS loopback mount on the same host, NFSD blocks waiting for XFSs call to __filemap_get_folio) 6070.550357] INFO task kcompactd058 blocked for more than 4435 seconds. {--- [58] kcompactd0 [] folio_wait_bit+0xe8/0x200 [] folio_wait_writeback+0x2b/0x80 [] nfs_wb_folio+0x80/0x1b0 [nfs] [] nfs_release_folio+0x68/0x130 [nfs] [] split_huge_page_to_list_to_order+0x362/0x840 [] migrate_pages_batch+0x43d/0xb90 [] migrate_pages_sync+0x9a/0x240 [] migrate_pages+0x93c/0x9f0 [] compact_zone+0x8e2/0x1030 [] compact_node+0xdb/0x120 [] kcompactd+0x121/0x2e0 [] kthread+0xcf/0x100 [] ret_from_fork+0x31/0x40 [] ret_from_fork_asm+0x1a/0x30 ---} [akpm@linux-foundation.org fix build]
