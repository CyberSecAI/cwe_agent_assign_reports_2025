  "description": "silverstripe/reports is an API for creating backend reports in the Silverstripe Framework. In affected versions reports can be accessed by their direct URL by any user who has access to view the reports admin section, even if the `canView()` method for that report returns `false`. This issue has been addressed in version 5.2.3. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe `Report` class in Silverstripe CMS has a `canView` method intended to control access to reports. However, even when this method is configured to return `false`, reports could still be accessed directly via their URL if the user had the `CMS_ACCESS_ReportAdmin` permission.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n- **Insufficient Access Control:** The `canView` method's access restrictions were not enforced when accessing reports directly, bypassing intended access controls.\n- **Permission Bypass:** Users with `CMS_ACCESS_ReportAdmin` were able to bypass `canView` restrictions.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- Unauthorized Access: Users could view reports they were not supposed to access based on the `canView` method's configuration.\n- Confidentiality Breach: Sensitive information contained in reports could be exposed to unauthorized users.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- Direct URL Access: An attacker could directly access the report via its URL.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- `CMS_ACCESS_ReportAdmin` Permission: The attacker needs to have the permission to access the reports admin section.\n- Knowledge of Report URL: The attacker needs to know the URL of the report they want to access.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n- The vulnerability affects `silverstripe/reports` versions prior to 5.2.3\n- The fix ensures that the `canView` check is properly respected when accessing reports directly.\n- The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 4.3 (Medium severity)",

While it could be more specific, no base-level CWE fits perfectly. CWE-425 Direct Request ('Forced Browsing') is related to CWE-285, as it can be a specific way that improper authorization manifests.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe425[\"CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\"]\n    \n    cwe425 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe285 primary\n    class cwe425 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **insufficient access control**, leading to **unauthorized access** and potential **confidentiality breach**. The root cause is the `canView` method not being properly enforced, and the impact is users accessing reports they shouldn't.\n  - **Root Cause:** **Insufficient Access Control** due to `canView` method not being enforced.\n  - **Weakness:** Users with `CMS_ACCESS_ReportAdmin` can bypass restrictions.\n  - **Impact:** **Unauthorized Access** and potential **Confidentiality Breach**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis pointed to CWE-285 Improper Authorization due to the **insufficient access control**. The vulnerability allows users with `CMS_ACCESS_ReportAdmin` to access reports they shouldn't, even when the `canView()` method returns `false`. The evidence is explicit: \"reports can be accessed by their direct URL by any user who has access to view the reports admin section, even if the `canView()` method for that report returns `false`.\"\n\nCWE-425 Direct Request ('Forced Browsing') was considered because the vulnerability involves accessing reports via direct URLs, which bypasses the intended access controls.\n\nThe final decision is to use CWE-285 as the primary CWE due to the broad nature of the **improper authorization** and CWE-425 as a secondary to specify the method of access, \"Direct Request\".

        "extended_description": "\n\nCross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:\n\n\n  1. Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.\n\n  1. The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.\n\n  1. During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.\n\n  1. A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.\n\n  1. Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.\n\n  1. This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.\n\nThere are three main kinds of XSS:\n\n  -  **Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent)**  - The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.\n\n  -  **Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent)**  - The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs. \n\n  -  **Type 0: DOM-Based XSS**  - In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible. \n\nOnce the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"\n\nIn many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.\n",
