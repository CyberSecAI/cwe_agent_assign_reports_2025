  "query": "BEC Technologies Multiple Routers Authentication Bypass Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to bypass authentication on affected installations of BEC Technologies routers. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the web-based user interface. The issue results from the lack of authentication prior to allowing access to functionality. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to bypass authentication on the system. Was ZDI-CAN-25894.",
