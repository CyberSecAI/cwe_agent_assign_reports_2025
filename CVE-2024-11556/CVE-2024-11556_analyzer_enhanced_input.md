## Vulnerability Description
IrfanView DXF File Parsing Memory Corruption Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of IrfanView. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of DXF files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a **memory corruption** condition. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-24795.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause:** The vulnerability stems from improper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of DXF files in IrfanView, leading to a memory corruption condition.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** The core weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization within the DXF file parsing logic. This allows malicious data to trigger memory corruption.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current IrfanView process. This could lead to complete system compromise if the user has elevated privileges.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a specially crafted malicious DXF file. This could be achieved by tricking a user into opening the file directly, or by visiting a webpage that loads the malicious file.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious DXF file to the victim. This could be achieved through social engineering or by hosting the file on a malicious website. User interaction is required to open the file or access the malicious content via a web browser.
