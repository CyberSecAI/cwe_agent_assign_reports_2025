  "description": "An issue was discovered in za-internet C-MOR Video Surveillance 5.2401 and 6.00PL01. Due to **insufficient input validation**, the C-MOR web interface is vulnerable to **OS command injection** attacks. It was found out that different functionality is vulnerable to **OS command injection** attacks, for example for generating new X.509 certificates, or setting the time zone. These **OS command injection** vulnerabilities in the script generatesslreq.pml can be exploited as a low-privileged authenticated user to execute commands in the context of the Linux user www-data via shell metacharacters in HTTP POST data (e.g., the city parameter). The **OS command injection** vulnerability in the script settimezone.pml or setdatetime.pml (e.g., via the year parameter) requires an administrative user for the C-MOR web interface. By also exploiting a privilege-escalation vulnerability, it is possible to execute commands on the C-MOR system with root privileges.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n\n*   Insufficient input validation in the C-MOR web interface allows for OS command injection. Specifically, user-supplied data is not properly sanitized before being used in system calls.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n\n*   **OS Command Injection (CWE-78):**  The primary vulnerability is that arbitrary operating system commands can be executed through vulnerable web interface scripts. Two scripts are specifically mentioned:\n    *   `generatesslreq.pml`: Vulnerable to command injection via the `city` parameter. This script is related to generating X.509 certificates.\n    *   `settimezone.pml`: Vulnerable to command injection when setting the time zone.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying system.\n*   **Web Shell Upload:** An attacker can upload a web shell, allowing for persistent access and further compromise of the system.\n*   **Privilege Escalation:** When combined with other vulnerabilities (SYSS-2024-027), the attacker can gain root privileges on the C-MOR system.\n*   **System Compromise:** Attackers can potentially gain full control of the C-MOR system, leading to data breaches, surveillance manipulation, or denial of service.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **HTTP POST Requests:** Attackers send crafted HTTP POST requests to vulnerable scripts.\n*   **Parameter Injection:** Malicious commands are injected via parameters such as `city` in `generatesslreq.pml` and date/time parameters in `settimezone.pml`.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Authenticated User (Low-Privileged):** For `generatesslreq.pml`, a low-privileged authenticated user is sufficient to exploit the vulnerability. This indicates the vulnerability is accessible to standard users.\n*   **Administrative User:** For `settimezone.pml`, an administrative user is required. However, this can be combined with the privilege escalation vulnerability to gain root access.\n*   **Network Access:** Attackers need network access to the C-MOR web interface.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n*   The vulnerability exists in C-MOR Video Surveillance versions 5.2401 and 6.00PL01.\n*   The fix for this vulnerability is not included in the software version 6.00PL01.\n*   The vulnerability in `generatesslreq.pml` allows execution as the `www-data` user by default, while the `settimezone.pml` attack can escalate privileges to root by exploiting another vulnerability\n*   The provided PoC demonstrates how to create a PHP web shell using the vulnerability in `generatesslreq.pml` and execute commands with `settimezone.pml`",

The vulnerability allows execution of arbitrary OS commands due to **insufficient input validation**. |\n| CWE-20 | Improper Input Validation | 0.7 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary CWE. The **root cause** is the **insufficient input validation**.|\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary weakness is CWE-78, which is a base-level CWE describing **OS command injection**. This stems from the **broader class of improper input validation**, CWE-20. CWE-78 is a child of CWE-77 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')), which is a more general class. The vulnerability description clearly indicates **OS command injection** as the **weakness**, making CWE-78 the most specific and appropriate choice.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: OS Command Injection\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Command Injection\"]\n    \n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n    cwe78 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe20\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe20 secondary\n    class cwe77 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **insufficient input validation** (CWE-20), which leads to **OS command injection** (CWE-78). This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system, potentially leading to privilege escalation and full system compromise.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-78 because the vulnerability description explicitly states that the C-MOR web interface is vulnerable to **OS command injection** attacks. This is due to **insufficient input validation** (CWE-20), which allows attackers to inject malicious commands via shell metacharacters in HTTP POST data. The vulnerability can be exploited by low-privileged authenticated users (for some scripts) or administrative users (for others). By exploiting a privilege-escalation vulnerability, it is possible to execute commands with root privileges.\n\nThe retriever results confirm CWE-78 as the top candidate. While CWE-20 is also relevant, it is a higher-level class that describes the root cause of the vulnerability, but CWE-78 describes the specific type of injection. Therefore, CWE-78 is more specific and suitable.\n\nOther CWEs were considered, but they were not selected because they did not accurately reflect the nature of the vulnerability. For example, CWE-89 (SQL Injection) was considered but rejected because the vulnerability involves **OS command injection**, not SQL injection. Similarly, CWE-22 (Path Traversal) was considered but rejected because the vulnerability does not involve manipulating file paths to access restricted directories. CWE-73 (External Control of File Name or Path) was also considered since the attack vector involves HTTP POST data, but the attack is more directly related to command injection, not path manipulation.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
