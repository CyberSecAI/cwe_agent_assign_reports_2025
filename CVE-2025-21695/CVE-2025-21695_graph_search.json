This ordering can trigger a NULL pointer dereference in the serdev controllers receive_buf handler, as it assumes serdev->ops is valid when SERPORT_ACTIVE is set. This is similar to the issue fixed in commit 5e700b384ec1 (platform/chrome cros_ec_uart properly fix race condition) where devm_serdev_device_open() was called before fully initializing the device. Fix the race by ensuring client ops are set before enabling the port via devm_serdev_device_open(). Note, serdev_device_set_baudrate() and serdev_device_set_flow_control() calls should be after the devm_serdev_device_open() call.
