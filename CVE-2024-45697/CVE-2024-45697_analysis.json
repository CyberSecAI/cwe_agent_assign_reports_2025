The ability to execute OS commands is a result of successful login with those credentials, and the **improper neutralization of special elements** in those commands is classified as CWE-78. CWE-259 is included because the vulnerability description mentions **hard-coded credentials**, which are used to log in.\n\nThe decision to use CWE-912 as the primary CWE is based on the vulnerability description's emphasis on the **hidden functionality** as the enabler for the vulnerability.
