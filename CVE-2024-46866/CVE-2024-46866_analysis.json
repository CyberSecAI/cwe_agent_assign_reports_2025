  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drm/xe/client add missing bo locking in show_meminfo() bo_meminfo() wants to inspect bo state like tt and the ttm resource, however this state can change at any point leading to stuff like NPD and UAF, if the bo lock is not held. Grab the bo lock when calling bo_meminfo(), ensuring we drop any spinlocks first. In the case of object_idr we now also need to hold a ref. v2 (MattB) - Also add xe_bo_assert_held() (cherry picked from commit 4f63d712fa104c3ebefcb289d1e733e86d8698c7)",

  "reference_content": "The provided content is related to the following vulnerability:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe `bo_meminfo()` function inspects the buffer object (bo) state, including the translation table (tt) and the TTM (Translation Table Manager) resource. This state can change at any time, leading to potential use-after-free (UAF) or null pointer dereference (NPD) issues if the bo lock is not held while accessing it.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- **Race Condition:** Concurrent access to the buffer object's state without proper locking. Specifically, the `bo_meminfo()` function was called without holding the necessary lock, allowing for potential modification of the bo's state by another thread while `bo_meminfo()` was operating on it, resulting in a race condition.\n- **Use-After-Free (UAF):** If the bo's state is modified or freed while `bo_meminfo()` is accessing it, it could result in a use-after-free condition.\n- **Null Pointer Dereference (NPD):** Accessing members of a freed object can lead to null pointer dereferences.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\nExploitation of this vulnerability could lead to:\n- Kernel crash due to NPD or UAF.\n- Potential privilege escalation or arbitrary code execution if the UAF can be manipulated.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\nAn attacker could trigger the `show_meminfo()` function through the debugfs interface, while also concurrently modifying buffer object states.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- The attacker needs to have the ability to trigger the `show_meminfo()` function, typically via a privileged user (or a user with access to debugfs).\n- The attacker also needs to be able to trigger changes in buffer object states while `show_meminfo()` is executing.\n\n**Additional details:**\nThe fix addresses the vulnerability by:\n- Adding the `xe_bo_assert_held()` function to assert that the bo lock is held when calling `bo_meminfo()`.\n- Ensuring the bo lock is acquired before calling `bo_meminfo()` and released afterwards using `xe_bo_lock()` and `xe_bo_unlock()`.\n- Adding a reference to the bo using `xe_bo_get()` to prevent it from being freed while `bo_meminfo()` is operating on it\n- Using `dma_resv_trylock` to acquire the lock directly if possible, otherwise acquiring lock with `xe_bo_lock` after dropping other locks to prevent deadlock\n- When iterating over the client's list of buffers, a reference is acquired to prevent the bo from being freed\n- The fix was backported to stable kernel versions starting from 6.8.",

It can lead to race conditions (**CWE-362**), which in turn can cause **Use-After-Free (CWE-416)** or **NULL Pointer Dereference (CWE-476)**. The relationship is hierarchical, with the class CWE-667 being a broader category that encompasses more specific concurrency issues, and the base CWEs representing concrete failure conditions that can occur due to the locking issue.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe667[\"CWE-667: Improper Locking\"]\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    cwe416[\"CWE-416: Use After Free\"]\n    cwe476[\"CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference\"]\n    \n    cwe362 -->|CHILDOF| cwe667\n    cwe416 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe362\n    cwe476 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe362\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe667 primary\n    class cwe362 secondary\n    class cwe416,cwe476 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing bo locking**. This **root cause** leads to a **race condition** where the buffer object's state can be changed while being inspected. This **race condition** can then result in a **use-after-free** or **null pointer dereference**.\n\nMissing Lock -> Race Condition -> Use-After-Free / Null Pointer Dereference\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the vulnerability description and the provided CVE reference links content summary. The key phrase \"missing bo locking in show_meminfo() bo_meminfo() ... if the bo lock is not held\" clearly indicates a locking issue. The CVE reference summary confirms this by stating, \"This state can change at any time, leading to potential use-after-free (UAF) or null pointer dereference (NPD) issues if the bo lock is not held while accessing it.\" This strongly supports the selection of CWE-667 as the primary weakness. The subsequent race condition (CWE-362) and potential UAF (CWE-416) or NPD (CWE-476) are impacts of the **improper locking**.\n\nThe selection of CWE-667 at the class level is appropriate because the vulnerability description focuses on the general issue of **missing locking**, rather than a specific locking mechanism. While more specific base-level CWEs related to locking might exist, the information provided does not allow for a more precise mapping.\n\n**CWE-667: Improper Locking**\n*   **Technical Explanation:** The code is missing necessary locking mechanisms when accessing shared buffer object state. This allows for concurrent modifications, leading to inconsistent or invalid data access.\n*   **Security Implications:** Missing locks can lead to race conditions and data corruption, potentially resulting in crashes, unexpected behavior, or even exploitable vulnerabilities like UAF or NPD.\n*   **Relationship:** This is the primary weakness and the root cause of the vulnerability. It is a class-level CWE.\n*   **Mapping Guidance Influence:** The guidance allows for CWE-667 but suggests reviewing for more specific base-level children. Since details are lacking to go to a more specific lock error, using the Class level is acceptable.\n\n**CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')**\n*   **Technical Explanation:** The vulnerability allows concurrent execution of code sequences that access and modify a shared resource (buffer object state) without proper synchronization, leading to a race condition.\n*   **Security Implications:** A race condition can lead to unpredictable behavior, data corruption, and exploitable vulnerabilities like UAF.\n*   **Relationship:** This is a consequence of the missing locking and a prerequisite for UAF or NPD.\n*   **Mapping Guidance Influence:** The guidance allows for CWE-362 but suggests reviewing for more specific base-level children. Since details are lacking to go to a more specific race condition, using the Class level is acceptable.\n\n**CWE-416: Use After Free**\n*   **Technical Explanation:** Due to the missing locking, a buffer object can be freed while still being accessed, leading to a use-after-free condition.\n*   **Security Implications:** UAF vulnerabilities are often exploitable and can lead to arbitrary code execution.\n*   **Relationship:** This is a potential impact of the race condition caused by the missing locking.\n*   **Mapping Guidance Influence:** This is a Variant level and is appropriate.\n\n**CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference**\n*   **Technical Explanation:** Due to the missing locking, a buffer object can be freed, and a pointer to it becomes a dangling pointer. Dereferencing this dangling pointer results in a null pointer dereference.\n*   **Security Implications:** NPD typically leads to crashes, but it can potentially be exploited.\n*   **Relationship:** This is a potential impact of the race condition caused by the missing locking.\n*   **Mapping Guidance Influence:** This is a Base level and is appropriate.\n\nOther CWEs Considered but Not Used:\n\n*   CWE-833 (Deadlock): While locking is involved, there is no evidence of a deadlock condition in the description.\n*   CWE-764 (Multiple Locks of a Critical Resource): The issue is the lack of locking, not multiple locks.\n*   CWE-909 (Missing Initialization of Resource): This doesn't fit the vulnerability as it's about the lack of locking a resource that is already initialized.\n*   CWE-413 (Improper Resource Locking): Similar to CWE-764, the core issue is the missing lock rather than improper locking.",
