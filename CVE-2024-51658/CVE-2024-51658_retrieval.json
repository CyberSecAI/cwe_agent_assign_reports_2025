This means that a malicious actor can potentially trick a logged-in user into performing unintended actions.\\n\\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\\n*   A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force higher-privileged users (e.g., administrators) to execute unwanted actions within the WordPress site, under their current authentication.\\n*   The exact impact will vary depending on the specific actions that can be triggered through the vulnerable plugin and the user's privileges.\\n\\n**Attack Vectors:**\\n*   The attack vector is through a CSRF attack, likely via social engineering tactics, such as a crafted link sent to a victim, or via other methods that allow a malicious actor to induce the victim into performing a request on a vulnerable website while they are logged in to that website.\\n\\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\\n*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious request that will be executed by a logged-in user.\\n*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated but relies on a victim being authenticated to the vulnerable website.\\n*   The attacker needs some mechanism to entice the victim into making the request (e.g. through a malicious link).\\n\\n**Additional Notes:**\\n*   The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 7.1, but it is noted that CVSS might not be ideal for CMS vulnerabilities. Patchstack considers the issue to have a low severity impact.\\n*   There is currently no official fix available for the vulnerability.\\n*   Patchstack has issued a virtual patch to mitigate this issue.\\n*   The vulnerability was reported by SOPROBRO on Oct 13, 2024.\\n\\nThe content provides more detail than a typical CVE description by outlining the specific vulnerability type, impact, and mitigation strategies, along with the affected version.\", similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {}, 'top_cwes_by_threshold': {}}}, similarity_summary=SimilarityInsight(consensus_cwe='', top_cwes=[], confidence_levels={}, total_samples=0), analysis='', analysis_with_relationships='', criticism='', resolution='', relevant_cwes=[{'metadata': {'doc_id': '352', 'name': 'Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'rootcause:lack of CSRF protection', 'keyphrase': 'lack of CSRF protection', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'weakness:XSS', 'keyphrase': 'XSS', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'weakness:cross-site scripting', 'keyphrase': 'cross-site scripting', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'impact:stored cross-site scripting', 'keyphrase': 'stored cross-site scripting', 'type': 'impact'}, {'id': 'product:Henrik Hoff WP Course Manager', 'keyphrase': 'Henrik Hoff WP Course Manager', 'type': 'product'}, {'id': 'version:n/a through 1.3', 'keyphrase': 'n/a through 1.3', 'type': 'version'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(310.32090244184985)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '434', 'name': 'Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'rootcause:lack of CSRF protection', 'keyphrase': 'lack of CSRF protection', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'weakness:XSS', 'keyphrase': 'XSS', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'weakness:cross-site scripting', 'keyphrase': 'cross-site scripting', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'impact:stored cross-site scripting', 'keyphrase': 'stored cross-site scripting', 'type': 'impact'}, {'id': 'product:Henrik Hoff WP Course Manager', 'keyphrase': 'Henrik Hoff WP Course Manager', 'type': 'product'}, {'id': 'version:n/a through 1.3', 'keyphrase': 'n/a through 1.3', 'type': 'version'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(247.75715685627893)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '79', 'name': \"Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\", 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'rootcause:lack of CSRF protection', 'keyphrase': 'lack of CSRF protection', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'weakness:XSS', 'keyphrase': 'XSS', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'weakness:cross-site scripting', 'keyphrase': 'cross-site scripting', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'impact:stored cross-site scripting', 'keyphrase': 'stored cross-site scripting', 'type': 'impact'}, {'id': 'product:Henrik Hoff WP Course Manager', 'keyphrase': 'Henrik Hoff WP Course Manager', 'type': 'product'}, {'id': 'version:n/a through 1.3', 'keyphrase': 'n/a through 1.3', 'type': 'version'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(206.60206430290816)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '89', 'name': \"Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\", 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.
