# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2025-20161
## Query
A vulnerability in the software upgrade process of Cisco Nexus 3000 Series Switches and Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode could allow an authenticated, local attacker with valid Administrator credentials to execute a command injection attack on the underlying operating system of an affected device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of specific elements within a software image. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by installing a crafted image. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system with root privileges.&nbsp Note Administrators should validate the hash of any software image before installation.

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: 'insufficient validation of specific elements within a software image'
- **weakness**: 'command injection'
