  "description": "A **command injection** vulnerability was found in the IndieAuth functionality of the Ruby on Rails based Haven blog web application. The affected functionality requires authentication, but an attacker can craft a link that they can pass to a logged in administrator of the blog software. This leads to the immediate execution of the provided commands when the link is accessed by the authenticated administrator. This issue may lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) and has been addressed by commit `c52f07c`. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",

Specifically, the application uses user-provided input in a way that allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Command Injection (CWE-78):** The core vulnerability is the improper handling of user input within the IndieAuth client functionality, which allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary system commands.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to arbitrary command execution on the server hosting the application.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Network:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely over the network.\n- **Crafted Link:** An attacker can create a malicious link containing embedded commands.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Authentication (Indirect):**  The attacker does not directly need to authenticate to the application. The vulnerability is exploited when an authenticated administrator clicks on a specially crafted link provided by the attacker.\n- **User Interaction:**  User interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability, as the administrator must click the attacker's malicious link.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n- The vulnerability exists in versions prior to commit `c52f07c`.\n- The fix was introduced in commit `c52f07c`, which adds URI validation to the IndieAuth flow.\n- The CVSS score is 8.4, which is considered high.\n- The attack complexity is \"High\", likely due to the requirement to craft a malicious link and get a user to click on it. The required user interaction is \"Required\" and the privileges required is \"None\"\n\nThe provided information gives more context than a typical CVE description, pinpointing the vulnerable component, the method of exploitation, and the specific commit that fixed the issue.",

CWE-88 is a peer of CWE-78, and can also be considered in cases of command injection where argument delimiters are improperly handled. The relationships influenced my decision to select CWE-78 as the primary due to the direct evidence of command injection.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: OS Command Injection\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Command Injection\"]\n    cwe88[\"CWE-88: Argument Injection\"]\n    \n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n    cwe88 -->|CANALSOBE| cwe78\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe77,cwe88 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper neutralization** of special elements in a command, specifically within the IndieAuth functionality. This leads to the **execution of arbitrary commands** when a crafted link is accessed by an authenticated administrator, ultimately resulting in **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**.\n\nVulnerability Chain: **Improper Neutralization** (CWE-78) -> **Command Execution** -> **Remote Code Execution**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nMy assessment is strongly based on the provided evidence, especially the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" which clearly states: \"The vulnerability is a command injection flaw...allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary system commands.\" The \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" also highlights \"**command injection**\" as the weakness.\n\nThe retriever results and graph relationships influenced the selection of CWE-78 as the primary CWE. While CWE-77 (Command Injection) is a parent class, CWE-78 (OS Command Injection) is a more specific base-level weakness that aligns directly with the vulnerability description. CWE-88 (Argument Injection) was considered as a secondary candidate due to its relationship with command injection, but the primary focus of the vulnerability is on the injection of OS commands, making CWE-78 a better fit.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately represent the root cause of the vulnerability (CWE-78) and provide additional context where applicable (CWE-88).\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.

The key would typically identify a user-related record stored in the system and would be used to lookup that record for presentation to the user. It is likely that an attacker would have to be an authenticated user in the system. However, the authorization process would not properly check the data access operation to ensure that the authenticated user performing the operation has sufficient entitlements to perform the requested data access, hence bypassing any other authorization checks present in the system.\n\n\nFor example, attackers can look at places where user specific data is retrieved (e.g. search screens) and determine whether the key for the item being looked up is controllable externally. The key may be a hidden field in the HTML form field, might be passed as a URL parameter or as an unencrypted cookie variable, then in each of these cases it will be possible to tamper with the key value.\n\n\nOne manifestation of this weakness is when a system uses sequential or otherwise easily-guessable session IDs that would allow one user to easily switch to another user's session and read/modify their data.\n",
