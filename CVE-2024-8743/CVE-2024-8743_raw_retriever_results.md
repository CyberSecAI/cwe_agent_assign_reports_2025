## Query
The Bit File Manager - 100% Free & Open Source File Manager and Code Editor for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Limited JavaScript File Upload in all versions up to, and including, 6.5.7. This is due to a lack of proper checks on allowed file types. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, and granted permissions by an administrator, to upload .css and .js files, which could lead to Stored Cross-Site Scripting.

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: 'lack of proper checks on allowed file types'
