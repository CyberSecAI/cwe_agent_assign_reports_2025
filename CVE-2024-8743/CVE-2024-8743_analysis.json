  "description": "The Bit File Manager - 100% Free & Open Source File Manager and Code Editor for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Limited JavaScript File Upload in all versions up to, and including, 6.5.7. This is due to a **lack of proper checks on allowed file types**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, and granted permissions by an administrator, to upload .css and .js files, which could lead to Stored Cross-Site Scripting.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-8743\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability stems from a lack of proper checks on allowed file types when uploading files via the \"Bit File Manager\" plugin. Specifically, the plugin does not adequately restrict the upload of potentially harmful file types.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Unrestricted File Upload:** The plugin allows the upload of `.css` and `.js` files, which are executable in a web browser context.\n- **Insufficient File Type Validation:**  The plugin fails to properly validate and restrict file uploads based on their MIME types.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** By uploading malicious `.js` or `.css` files, attackers can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the website, leading to XSS attacks. This allows attackers to execute malicious scripts in the browsers of other users who visit the affected pages.\n- **Potential for Further Compromise:** Successful exploitation of XSS can be leveraged to perform various malicious actions, potentially leading to further compromise of the website.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **File Upload Functionality:** Attackers exploit the file upload feature of the plugin.\n- **MIME Type Bypass:** The plugin fails to adequately validate file uploads based on their MIME types, allowing attackers to bypass any existing restrictions.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least \"Subscriber\"-level access.\n- **Permissions:** The attacker needs to have the necessary file management permissions granted by an administrator.\n- **Access to File Manager Functionality**: The user must have access to the file upload feature within the plugin.\n\n**Additional Notes**\n\n- The vulnerability was present in versions up to and including 6.5.7 of the \"Bit File Manager\" plugin.\n- Version 6.5.8 of the plugin includes a fix for this issue.\n- The fix includes restricting javascript and css file types for shortcodes and allows the admin to allow from permission settings if required.\n- The plugin developers have updated the plugin to address this vulnerability which involves changes in `FileManagerController.php`, `PermissionsController.php` and `PermissionsProvider.php` to add  `javascript`, `css` to the list of allowed file types to be managed by admin.\n- The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 6.8 which is medium.\n- The Wordfence vulnerability database provides detailed information about the vulnerability including a link to the plugin's changeset that addresses it, and links to CVE.",

CWE-434 is the root cause, and CWE-79 is a consequence of the uploaded file not being properly handled, leading to potential XSS.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe434[\"CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n\n    cwe434 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe79\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe434 primary\n    class cwe79 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of proper checks on allowed file types (CWE-434)**. This allows an attacker to upload `.css` and `.js` files. Because these files are not properly neutralized, this leads to **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (CWE-79)**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-434 as the primary weakness due to the **lack of proper checks on allowed file types**. This is the direct root cause. The secondary weakness is CWE-79, which is a consequence of the unrestricted file upload. The relationship graph and the vulnerability chain both support this conclusion.
