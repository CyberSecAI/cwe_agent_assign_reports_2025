## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved x86/CPU/AMD Clear **virtualized VMLOAD/VMSAVE** on Zen4 client A number of Zen4 client SoCs advertise the ability to use **virtualized VMLOAD/VMSAVE**, but using these instructions is reported to be a cause of a random host reboot. These instructions arent intended to be advertised on Zen4 client so clear the capability.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **virtualized VMLOAD/VMSAVE**
- **impact:** random host reboot
- **product:** Linux kernel
- **component:** x86/CPU/AMD Zen4 client

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Some AMD Zen4 client SoCs incorrectly advertise support for virtualized VMLOAD/VMSAVE instructions. Using these instructions can lead to random host reboots.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The primary weakness is the incorrect advertisement of the virtualized VMLOAD/VMSAVE feature in certain Zen4 client SoCs.
- This discrepancy between advertised capabilities and actual stability leads to an unstable system if the feature is used.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The primary impact of exploiting this vulnerability is system instability, specifically random host reboots. This could lead to data loss or denial of service.
- The "exploitation" in this case is using the advertised virtualized VMLOAD/VMSAVE instructions.

**Attack vectors:**
- There is no specific attack vector in the traditional sense. The vulnerability arises from the system using the faulty advertised feature.
- A malicious actor or even a standard process that utilized the problematic VMLOAD/VMSAVE instructions could trigger the reboot.
- This isn't a remotely exploitable issue; it's a fault in the hardware and how the operating system interacts with the advertised feature.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- No specific attacker capabilities are needed. Any process that triggers virtualized VMLOAD/VMSAVE instructions on affected Zen4 client SoCs can cause the instability. This includes both userland and kernel code.
- The attacker would need to have code execution on the affected machine.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix involves clearing the `X86_FEATURE_V_VMSAVE_VMLOAD` capability flag for the affected AMD Zen4 client SoCs. This prevents the system from attempting to use the unstable feature.
- The vulnerability is not due to a software bug, but rather a misadvertisement of hardware capabilities by the BIOS.
- The commit messages explicitly mentions this is a hardware issue with the CPU and the goal of this change is to disable the faulty functionality in the kernel.
