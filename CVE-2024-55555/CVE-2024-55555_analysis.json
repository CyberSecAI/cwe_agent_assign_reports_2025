  "cve_id": "CVE-2024-55555",
  "description": "Invoice Ninja before 5.10.43 allows remote code execution from a pre-authenticated route when an attacker knows the APP_KEY. This is exacerbated by .env files, available from the products repository, that have default APP_KEY values. The route/{hash} route defined in the invoiceninja/routes/client.php file can be accessed without authentication. The parameter {hash} is passed to the function decrypt that expects a Laravel ciphered value containing a serialized object. (Furthermore, Laravel contains several gadget chains usable to trigger remote command execution from arbitrary **deserialization**.) Therefore, an attacker in possession of the APP_KEY is able to fully control a string passed to an unserialize function.",

  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2024-55555 based on provided content\n\nThe provided content from synacktiv.com details two vulnerabilities in InvoiceNinja, which align with the CVE description. Here's a breakdown of the extracted information:\n\n**1. Root Cause:**\n\n*   **Default APP\\_KEY:** Several `.env` templates in the InvoiceNinja GitHub repository contain default values for the `APP_KEY` environment variable. This allows attackers to potentially exploit the second vulnerability if a user doesn't generate a unique key.\n*   **Unsafe Deserialization:** The `/route/{hash}` route decrypts a user-controlled value using Laravel's `decrypt()` function, which by default unserializes the data. This allows for remote code execution if the attacker has access to the `APP_KEY`.\n\n**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Insecure Deserialization:**  The use of `unserialize()` on potentially untrusted data without proper validation.\n*   **Exposure of Sensitive Information:** The presence of default `APP_KEY` values in publicly accessible repository files.\n*   **Lack of Authentication:** The `/route/{hash}` route is accessible without authentication.\n\n**3. Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An unauthenticated attacker with access to the `APP_KEY` can execute arbitrary commands on the server.\n\n**4. Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   An attacker can exploit the `/route/{hash}` endpoint by providing a crafted payload that, when decrypted and unserialized, executes malicious code.\n*   The attacker needs to obtain the `APP_KEY`, which could be through the default values in the repository or other means.\n*   The `laravel-crypto-killer` and `phpggc` tools are mentioned as being used to generate and exploit the vulnerability.\n\n**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   The attacker needs to know or be able to discover the `APP_KEY`.\n*   The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the `/route/{hash}` endpoint.\n*   The attacker needs knowledge of PHP deserialization vulnerabilities and Laravel's encryption mechanisms.\n\n**6. Mitigation/Fix:**\n\n*   **Upgrade:** Upgrade InvoiceNinja to version 5.10.11 or greater.\n*   **Generate Unique APP\\_KEY:** If using a self-hosted instance, ensure a unique `APP_KEY` is generated using the `php artisan key:generate` command and *not* using the default values from the `.env` templates.\n\n**Additional Details (More than CVE Description):**\n\n*   The advisory provides a detailed timeline of discovery and patching.\n*   It includes specific commit links to the vulnerable code and the fix.\n*   It details the tools used for exploitation (laravel-crypto-killer, phpggc).\n*   It provides a video demonstrating the exploitation process.\n*   The advisory also mentions the use of the XSRF-TOKEN cookie in the exploitation process.\n\n**In summary, the content provides a comprehensive analysis of the vulnerability, going beyond the basic information typically found in a CVE description.**",

This is enabled by the presence of a default `APP_KEY` (CWE-321), combined with a route that does not require authentication (CWE-306). The final impact is remote code execution (RCE).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial assessment pointed to **CWE-502 (Deserialization of Untrusted Data)** as the primary weakness. The analysis of the CVE description and the provided synacktiv.com content strongly supports this. The vulnerability involves **deserializing** data without proper validation, leading to remote code execution.\n\nThe presence of a default `APP_KEY` (CWE-321) exacerbates the issue, as it allows attackers to craft malicious payloads. Furthermore, the lack of authentication (CWE-306) on the affected route makes it easier for attackers to exploit the vulnerability.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. **CWE-502** is a Base-level CWE that accurately describes the root cause of the vulnerability. **CWE-321** and **CWE-306** are also at appropriate abstraction levels, highlighting contributing factors.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
