Several Base-level CWEs such as CWE-22, CWE-23, CWE-36, and CWE-73 are related to path traversal and information disclosure, offering more specific potential root causes. While CWE-200 is a general weakness, it encapsulates the observed behavior of disclosing full pathnames. The relationships influenced the decision by highlighting possible root causes (path traversal) leading to the information exposure, but the description lacks the specifics to confirm any of them.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Information Exposure\"]\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\"]\n    cwe23[\"CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\"]\n    cwe36[\"CWE-36: Absolute Path Traversal\"]\n    cwe73[\"CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\"]\n\n    cwe22 -->|ParentOf| cwe200\n    cwe23 -->|ParentOf| cwe200\n    cwe36 -->|ParentOf| cwe200\n    cwe73 -->|ParentOf| cwe200\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe22,cwe23,cwe36,cwe73 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a request to `Virto.SharePoint.FileDownloader/Api/Download.ashx?action=archive`, leading to the disclosure of full pathnames. The **root cause** is not explicitly mentioned but could be related to path traversal or **improper** access control. The **impact** is information exposure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-200 as the primary weakness because the vulnerability description explicitly states that it \"discloses full pathnames.\" This aligns directly with the definition of Information Exposure. However, there is no rootcause information to analyze further and map to a specific rootcause.\n\nThe evidence is weak, as it relies solely on the vulnerability description. The absence of details in the CVE reference links further reduces confidence. Based on the limited information, CWE-200 is the most appropriate high-level classification.\n\nCWE-22, CWE-23, CWE-36 and CWE-73 were considered because of the component name FileDownloader and the action archive, hinting at path manipulation issues. However, without explicit evidence of **improper** path handling, these are only secondary considerations.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were
