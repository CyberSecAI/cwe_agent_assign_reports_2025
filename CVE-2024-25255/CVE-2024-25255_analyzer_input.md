- **product:** Sublime Text
- **version:** 4
- **component:** New Build System module

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-25255:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the design of Sublime Text's build system feature, which allows users to define custom build processes using JSON files. Specifically, the `shell_cmd` option within a `.sublime-build` file enables the execution of arbitrary shell commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **OS Command Injection:** The core vulnerability is the ability to inject and execute arbitrary operating system commands via the `shell_cmd` option. This is because the value of `shell_cmd` is directly passed to the operating system's shell for execution.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The `shell_cmd` option does not sanitize or validate user-provided input, allowing for the execution of malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system where Sublime Text is running.
- **System Compromise:** This could lead to a full system compromise, data exfiltration, malware installation, or any other malicious activity that can be achieved by running commands on the compromised system.
- **Reverse Shell:** As demonstrated in the exploit example, an attacker can easily establish a reverse shell connection to their machine to further control the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious `.sublime-build` files:** An attacker could distribute a crafted `.sublime-build` file to a victim. This could be achieved through social engineering, supply chain attacks, or by embedding the malicious file within a project.
- **User Configuration:** Unsuspecting users could unknowingly create or modify a `.sublime-build` file with malicious `shell_cmd` parameters, which they would then execute.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Create/Modify `.sublime-build` Files:** The attacker needs to be able to create or modify `.sublime-build` files, either on the victim's machine or through a method that causes the victim to load such a file.
- **Knowledge of Target System:** To craft effective exploits, the attacker would likely need knowledge of the target operating system and the shell environment used by Sublime Text.
- **User Interaction:** The user must then execute the build process (e.g. `Ctrl+B`) for the malicious code to be run.

**Additional Notes:**
- It is important to note that the Sublime Text documentation describes the behavior of the `shell_cmd` option as intended functionality. However, when used without caution, it introduces a significant security risk.
- The forum discussion reveals that some consider the CVE invalid as the behavior is by design, however the potential security impact is still clear.

In summary, while the functionality is intended, the lack of security around user-defined commands in Sublime Text's build system makes it vulnerable to OS command injection, potentially leading to system compromise.
