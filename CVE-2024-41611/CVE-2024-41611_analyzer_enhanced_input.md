## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Telnet service in the D-Link DIR-860L router firmware has hardcoded credentials.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Hardcoded credentials for the Telnet service.
- Telnet service enabled by default (inferred from the analysis).
- The credentials located in the `/etc/config/image_sign` file are easily accessible.
- Script `S80telnetd.sh` starts the Telnet service with the hardcoded password.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can gain unauthorized remote access to the router's Telnet service.
- Once logged in, attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the router, potentially leading to complete control over the device.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote network access to the Telnet service (port 23).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network connectivity to the target router.
- Knowledge of the hardcoded username and password, which can be obtained from the `/etc/config/image_sign` file.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects at least firmware version "DIR-860L\_REVA\_FIRMWARE\_PATCH\_1.10..B04".
- The content provides evidence of the hardcoded credentials location.
- The content explains how to start the telnet service using the `S80telnetd.sh` script located in the `/squashfs-root/etc/init0.d/` directory.

The provided information offers more details than a typical CVE description, detailing the location of the credentials and the specific script that is being used.
