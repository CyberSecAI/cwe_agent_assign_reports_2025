  "description": "A vulnerability was found in itsourcecode Tailoring Management System 1.0 and classified as critical. This issue affects some unknown processing of the file /expedit.php. The manipulation of the argument expcat leads to **sql injection**. The attack may be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.",

  },
  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n- The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `expedit.php` file, specifically the `expcat` parameter, before it's used in SQL queries.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The application directly uses the unsanitized `expcat` parameter in SQL queries, making it susceptible to SQL injection attacks.\n- **Lack of Input Validation:** The application fails to validate and sanitize user input, specifically the `expcat` parameter, which is directly used in SQL queries.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- **Unauthorized Database Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database.\n- **Sensitive Data Leakage:**  Attackers can retrieve sensitive information stored in the database.\n- **Data Tampering:**  Attackers can modify or delete data within the database.\n- **Comprehensive System Control:** Attackers might gain control over the system through database manipulation.\n- **Service Interruption:**  Attackers could potentially disrupt the system's services.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP POST request to the `expedit.php` file.\n- **`expcat` Parameter:** The vulnerable parameter is `expcat`, which is included in the POST request body using `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web server hosting the application.\n- **Knowledge of the vulnerable parameter:** The attacker needs to know that the `expcat` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection.\n- **Ability to send HTTP requests:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n- The vulnerability is a time-based blind SQL injection.\n- A proof of concept (POC) is provided, demonstrating how to exploit this vulnerability by injecting a sleep command via the `expcat` parameter.\n- The content also provides examples of SQLMap being used to exploit the vulnerability\n- The vulnerable application is the \"Tailoring Management System Project In PHP With Source Code\" version 1.0\n- The vulnerable file is `expedit.php`",

The **SQL Injection** vulnerability is due to **improper neutralization** of special elements used in an SQL command. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship to consider is that CWE-89 is a base-level CWE, which is the preferred level of abstraction. There are several related CWEs that could be part of a vulnerability chain, such as CWE-73 (External Control of File Name or Path) which can precede CWE-89.
