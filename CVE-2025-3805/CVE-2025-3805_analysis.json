Affected by this vulnerability is an unknown functionality of the file check_id.py of the component Jinja2 Template Handler. The manipulation of the argument ID leads to **injection**. It is possible to launch the attack on the local host. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. This product does not use versioning. This is why information about affected and unaffected releases are unavailable.",

  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-3805 Content\n\nThe provided content details a Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerability in the `tournatrack` application, specifically within the `check_id.py` file. This directly relates to a potential security issue.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input validation and sanitization of the `id` parameter received from the user. This parameter is directly used in the Jinja2 template rendering process without being checked for malicious template expressions.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI):** The core vulnerability.\n*   **Improper Input Validation:** The application fails to validate user-supplied input.\n*   **Unsafe Use of Template Engine:** The Jinja2 template engine is used without adequate security measures to prevent malicious code execution.\n*   **CWE-1336:** Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive data like database connection strings, API keys, and user authentication tokens can be exposed.\n*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on the server, leading to a full system compromise.\n*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Malicious input can cause the application to crash or become unresponsive.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Crafted HTTP requests to the `/checkID` endpoint with malicious Jinja2 expressions in the `id` parameter.\n*   Examples provided:\n    *   `http://example.com/checkID?id={{ 7 * 7 }}` (simple expression evaluation)\n    *   `http://example.com/checkID?id={{ config.items() }}` (accessing application configuration)\n    *   `http://example.com/checkID?id={{ ''.__class__.__mro__[2].__subclasses__()[40]('/etc/passwd').read() }}` (attempting to read `/etc/passwd` on a Linux system)\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the `/checkID` endpoint.\n*   No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability, as the `id` parameter is directly accessible via a URL.\n*   Knowledge of Jinja2 template syntax and potential exploitation techniques is beneficial.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\nThe content does not provide a specific fix, but implies that proper input validation and sanitization of the `id` parameter are necessary to prevent the SSTI vulnerability. This could involve:\n\n*   Input validation to ensure the `id` parameter only contains expected characters or values.\n*   Escaping or sanitizing the `id` parameter before passing it to the Jinja2 template engine.\n*   Using a more secure templating engine or configuration.\n\n**Note:** The content provides significantly more detail than a typical CVE description, including specific exploit examples and potential impact scenarios.",

CWE-74 is a Class level CWE and a parent of CWE-1336, but is discouraged because it is too general. The vulnerability involves the manipulation of the ID argument leading to injection via the Jinja2 Template Handler. Therefore, CWE-1336 is the best fit as it specifically addresses template engine injection.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1336[\"CWE-1336: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    \n    cwe1336 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe1336 primary\n    class cwe74 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper neutralization** of special elements in the `ID` argument, which is then used in the Jinja2 template. This leads to code injection, specifically Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment pointed to several injection-related CWEs, but after carefully reviewing the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, CWE-1336 emerged as the most appropriate. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions the Jinja2 Template Handler and the manipulation of the ID argument leading to injection. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the root cause is the lack of proper input validation and sanitization of the `id` parameter. This parameter is directly used in the Jinja2 template rendering process without being checked for malicious template expressions.\n\nThe Retriever Results also list CWE-1336 as a potential match, further supporting the selection. Other CWEs like CWE-79 (Cross-site Scripting) and CWE-89 (SQL Injection) were considered but deemed less relevant as the vulnerability specifically involves template injection rather than web page generation or SQL command construction.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1336: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a template engine to insert or process externally-influenced input, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements or syntax that can be interpreted as template expressions or other code directives when processed by the engine.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\nCWE-1336 is the most specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability, aligning with the root cause and technical details provided.\n\n**CWE-1336: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine**\nThe product uses a template engine to insert or process externally-influenced input, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements or syntax that can be interpreted as template expressions or other code directives when processed by the engine. This directly aligns with the description of the vulnerability, where the `ID` argument is not properly neutralized, leading to template injection. The security implication is that an attacker can inject malicious code into the template, potentially leading to remote code execution or information disclosure. This is the primary weakness. Confidence: 1.0\n\n**CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')**\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component. While this CWE broadly covers injection vulnerabilities, it is less specific than CWE-1336, which directly addresses template engine injection. CWE-74 is a parent of CWE-1336. Given the availability of a more specific CWE, CWE-74 is less preferred. Usage: Discouraged. Confidence: 0.6",
