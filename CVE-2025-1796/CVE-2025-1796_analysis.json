  "description": "A vulnerability in langgenius/dify v0.10.1 allows an attacker to take over any account, including administrator accounts, by exploiting a weak pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) used for generating password reset codes. The application uses `random.randint` for this purpose, which is not suitable for cryptographic use and can be cracked. An attacker with access to workflow tools can extract the PRNG output and predict future password reset codes, leading to a complete compromise of the application.",

The vulnerability description states, \"The application uses `random.randint` for this purpose, which is not suitable for cryptographic use and can be cracked.\" This directly supports the selection of CWE-338. The secondary weakness (CWE-340) describes the broader issue of generating predictable values but is less specific than CWE-338. The choice of CWE-338 is at the optimal level of specificity as it accurately describes the root cause of the vulnerability. Other CWEs, like CWE-337 (Predictable Seed), are related, but the core issue isn't necessarily a predictable seed but the weakness of the PRNG itself, which makes it crackable.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-338: Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) in a security context, but the PRNG's algorithm is not cryptographically strong.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-335: Incorrect Usage of Seeds in Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) but does not correctly manage seeds.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
