## Vulnerability Description
vaultwarden is an unofficial Bitwarden compatible server written in Rust, formerly known as bitwarden_rs. Attacker can obtain owner rights of other organization. Hacker should know the ID of victim organization (in real case the user can be a part of the organization as an unprivileged user) and be the owner/admin of other organization (by default you can create your own organization) in order to attack. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.33.0.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** obtain owner rights of other organization
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** vaultwarden

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-24365 based on provided content:

**CVE Description:** PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval (as per instructions)

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from variable confusion in the `OrgHeaders` trait within `src/auth.rs`. Specifically, the server retrieves the organization UUID from either the path parameter or a GET query parameter. If both are present, the GET query parameter overwrites the path parameter.  This allows an attacker to manipulate the organization ID used in subsequent operations.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **CWE-284:** Improper List of Files to Include (This is the CWE listed in the advisory)
*   Variable confusion/parameter manipulation.
*   Insecure direct object reference (IDOR) - an attacker can access resources of another organization by manipulating the organization ID.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Privilege escalation:** An attacker can gain owner rights in a foreign organization.
*   **Data breach:** Potential access to sensitive data within the compromised organization.
*   **Unauthorized access:** Ability to invite users and modify settings within the target organization.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
*   **DELETE request:** Deleting a foreign organization using a manipulated `organizationId` query parameter.
*   **POST request:** Inviting users to a foreign organization or confirming user enrollment using a manipulated `organizationId` query parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to know the UUID of the target organization.
*   The attacker needs to be an owner or admin of another organization.
*   Low privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability. No user interaction is needed.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   The vulnerability is patched in version 1.33.0.
*   The remediation developer is identified as BlackDex.
*   The advisory recommends updating to the patched version as soon as possible.

**Additional Details (more detail than official CVE description):**

The content provides a detailed explanation of the vulnerability, including the specific code location (`src/auth.rs`), a PoC demonstrating how to exploit the vulnerability, and a CVSS score (High - 8.1). It also lists the contributors who reported and fixed the issue. The advisory also details the specific endpoints that are vulnerable.
