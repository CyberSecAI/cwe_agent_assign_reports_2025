  },
  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:** Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerability exists due to the lack of proper sanitization or encoding of user-provided input when creating Search Template Dashboards. This allows malicious users to inject template syntax that is then processed by the server.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n*   **Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI):**  The core vulnerability is the ability to inject code into a server-side template. This is due to the application's failure to treat user-provided data as untrusted when constructing the template.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n*   **Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of SSTI can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server.\n*   **Data Breach/Information Disclosure:** Attackers could gain access to sensitive information, modify data, or cause denial of service. The CVSS vector specifies:\n    *   **VC:H (Confidentiality Impact: High):** Significant unauthorized access to confidential data.\n    *   **VI:L (Integrity Impact: Low):** Limited alterations to data by an unauthorized party.\n    *  **VA:L (Availability Impact: Low):** Limited disruption of services.\n    * **SC:L (Scope Change: Low):** A successful attack would have limited impact beyond the compromised application\n    * **SI:L (Subsequent access impact: Low):** The attack has a limited impact on resources\n    * **SA:L (System access impact: Low):** Limited ability to modify the systems resource\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n*   **Search Template Dashboard Creation:** The attack vector is specifically through the process of creating a \"Search Template Dashboard\".\n*   **Payload Injection:** Attackers inject malicious code within the template creation process.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Logpoint platform.\n*   **Access to Search Template Dashboard Creation:** The attacker needs access to the feature for creating a \"Search Template Dashboard\" to inject malicious content.\n* **Low Privileges**: Attackers can exploit this vulnerability even with low privileges.\n\n**Additional Notes**\n\n*   The vulnerability is identified as CWE-1336, which is \"Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Template Engine\".\n*   The issue is present in Logpoint versions prior to 7.5.0.\n*   The vendor has provided a solution to mitigate this vulnerability by upgrading to version 7.5.0.\n*   The CVSS v4.0 score is 5.9, which is rated as medium severity.",

It is also a peer of CWE-917 [Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')], which also relates to injection within specific contexts. While CWE-94 [Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')] is a broader category, CWE-1336 provides a more precise classification for this vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1336[\"CWE-1336: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine\"]\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n    cwe917[\"CWE-917: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')\"]\n\n    cwe1336 -->|CHILDOF| cwe94\n    cwe1336 --|PEEROF| cwe917\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1336 primary\n    class cwe94 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper neutralization** of special elements used in a template engine, leading to **server-side template injection**, and ultimately resulting in potential code execution.\n\nCWE-1336 (Root Cause: Improper Neutralization) -> Server-Side Template Injection (Impact: Code Execution).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly points to CWE-1336 [Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine] as the primary weakness. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions **\"Server-Side Template Injection\"** and the ability to **\"inject payloads\"** while creating search template dashboards. This aligns directly with the description of CWE-1336, which focuses on the **improper neutralization** of special elements used in a template engine.\n\nThe key phrases \"Server-Side Template Injection\" and \"inject payloads\" directly support this classification.\n\nCWE-94 [Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')] was considered as a secondary CWE due to the code execution aspect of template injection. However, since CWE-1336 is a more specific type of **code injection** related to template engines, it is the more appropriate primary classification.\n\nThe relationships between CWEs, particularly the child-of relationship between CWE-1336 and CWE-94, reinforces the choice of CWE-1336 as the primary CWE. It is a more specific variant of the broader **code injection** category.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, as CWE-1336 directly addresses the root cause, which is **improper neutralization** within a template engine.\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
