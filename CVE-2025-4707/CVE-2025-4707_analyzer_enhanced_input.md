## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The content relates to CVE-2025-4707. It provides more detail than the official CVE description (which is currently a placeholder).

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

A SQL injection vulnerability was found in the '/pages/transaction\_add.php' file of the 'Sales and Inventory System' project. The reason for this issue is that attackers inject malicious code from the parameter 'prod\_name' and use it directly in SQL queries without the need for appropriate cleaning or validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

* SQL injection

**Impact of exploitation:**

Attackers can exploit this SQL injection vulnerability to achieve unauthorized database access, sensitive data leakage, data tampering, comprehensive system control, and even service interruption.

**Attack vectors:**

* The 'prod\_name' parameter in the '/pages/transaction\_add.php' file is vulnerable. No login or authorization is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

* An attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the '/pages/transaction\_add.php' file with a malicious 'prod\_name' parameter. No authentication is required.

**Mitigation or fix:**

* Use prepared statements and parameter binding.
* Input validation and filtering.
* Minimize database user permissions.
* Regular security audits.

**Payload examples (from the content):**

*   `prod_name=5' AND 6171=6171 AND 'KnxJ'='KnxJ&cid=1&qty=3&addtocart=`
*   `prod_name=5' OR (SELECT 3754 FROM(SELECT COUNT(*),CONCAT(0x71717a7171,(SELECT (ELT(3754=3754,1))),0x7178626271,FLOOR(RAND(0)*2))x FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PLUGINS GROUP BY x)a) AND 'uqDB'='uqDB&cid=1&qty=3&addtocart=`
*   `prod_name=5' AND (SELECT 3185 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))Tcxp) AND 'Gmjq'='Gmjq&cid=1&qty=3&addtocart=`
