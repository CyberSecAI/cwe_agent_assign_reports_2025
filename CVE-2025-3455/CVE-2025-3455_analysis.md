# Analysis for CVE-2025-3455

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-862 | Missing Authorization | 1.0 | Class | Primary | Allowed-with-Review |
| CWE-434 | Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type | 0.7 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is CWE-862: Missing Authorization, a Class-level CWE. A more specific Base CWE under CWE-862 could have been chosen, but no direct child CWEs were provided in the Enhanced Context information. CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type is related to the impact of the missing authorization, as the lack of authorization allows for arbitrary file uploads. CWE-434 can lead to other vulnerabilities like code execution.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **missing authorization** (CWE-862) on the `start_restore` function, which leads to the ability to **upload arbitrary files** (CWE-434). This, in turn, makes remote code execution possible.

## Summary of Analysis
The primary weakness is clearly a **missing capability check**, which directly corresponds to CWE-862 (Missing Authorization). The vulnerability description states that the plugin is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a **missing capability check** on the `start_restore` function. This allows authenticated attackers with subscriber-level access to upload arbitrary files.

The secondary weakness is the impact of this missing authorization: the ability to upload arbitrary files, represented by CWE-434 (Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type). This can lead to remote code execution.

The evidence supporting these mappings comes directly from the vulnerability description, which highlights the **missing capability check** as the root cause and the ability to upload arbitrary files as a direct consequence.

The graph relationships influenced the selection by showing how missing authorization can lead to other vulnerabilities such as unrestricted file uploads.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-862 directly describes the **missing authorization**, and CWE-434 describes the immediate consequence of the vulnerability i.e. **upload arbitrary files**.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
**Abstraction Level**: Compound
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.



## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-862: Missing Authorization
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.67
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.67
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently ensuring that the resulting data will be valid.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-96: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Statically Saved Code ('Static Code Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.66
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes code syntax before inserting the input into an executable resource, such as a library, configuration file, or template.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output
**Abstraction Level**: Class
