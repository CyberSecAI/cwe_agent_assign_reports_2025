{
  "query": "A vulnerability in the segment routing feature for the Intermediate System-to-Intermediate System (IS-IS) protocol of Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of ingress IS-IS packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specific IS-IS packets to an affected device after forming an adjacency. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the IS-IS process on all affected devices that are participating in the Flexible Algorithm to crash and restart, resulting in a DoS condition. Note The IS-IS protocol is a routing protocol. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be Layer 2-adjacent to the affected device and must have formed an adjacency. This vulnerability affects segment routing for IS-IS over IPv4 and IPv6 control planes as well as devices that are configured as level 1, level 2, or multi-level routing IS-IS type.",
