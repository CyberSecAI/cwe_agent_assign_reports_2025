  "description": "A vulnerability in the segment routing feature for the Intermediate System-to-Intermediate System (IS-IS) protocol of Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to **insufficient input validation** of ingress IS-IS packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specific IS-IS packets to an affected device after forming an adjacency. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the IS-IS process on all affected devices that are participating in the Flexible Algorithm to crash and restart, resulting in a DoS condition. Note The IS-IS protocol is a routing protocol. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be Layer 2-adjacent to the affected device and must have formed an adjacency. This vulnerability affects segment routing for IS-IS over IPv4 and IPv6 control planes as well as devices that are configured as level 1, level 2, or multi-level routing IS-IS type.",

  "reference_content": "- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient input validation of ingress IS-IS packets.\n- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper validation of IS-IS packets within the segment routing feature for the IS-IS protocol in Cisco IOS XR Software. This insufficient validation allows an attacker to send specially crafted IS-IS packets that can trigger a crash of the IS-IS process.\n- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation leads to a denial of service (DoS) condition, causing the IS-IS process on affected devices participating in the Flexible Algorithm to crash and restart.\n- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves sending specific, crafted IS-IS packets to a vulnerable device.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be Layer 2-adjacent to the affected device and must have successfully formed an adjacency with it. The attacker does not need authentication to exploit the vulnerability, however, configuring IS-IS area authentication is recommended as a mitigation to slow down attackers.",

While more specific Base or Variant level CWEs are preferred, the provided description lacks the necessary details to pinpoint the exact nature of the input validation failure. Many CWEs are children of CWE-20 [Improper Input Validation], such as CWE-129 [Improper Validation of Array Index], CWE-1284 [Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input], and CWE-170 [Improper Null Termination]. However, without more specifics, the general CWE-20 [Improper Input Validation] is more appropriate.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe20 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **insufficient input validation** (CWE-20 [Improper Input Validation]) of IS-IS packets, leading to a crash and restart of the IS-IS process, ultimately resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. The root cause is clearly the **improper input validation**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment, based on the vulnerability description, points towards **insufficient input validation** as the root cause. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" explicitly states this: \"Root cause of vulnerability: Insufficient input validation of ingress IS-IS packets.\" The selection of CWE-20 [Improper Input Validation] is further supported by the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases,\" which highlights \"**insufficient input validation**\" as the root cause.\n\nThe Retriever Results also list CWE-20 [Improper Input Validation] as a candidate. Although it is generally discouraged to use Class-level CWEs, the provided information does not allow for a more specific CWE selection. Other CWEs from the Retriever Results were considered, such as CWE-1284 [Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input], but there isn't enough information to confirm this more specific type of **improper validation**. Thus, CWE-20 [Improper Input Validation] is the most appropriate choice given the available evidence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
