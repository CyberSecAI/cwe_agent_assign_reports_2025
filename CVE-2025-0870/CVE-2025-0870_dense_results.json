  "query": "A vulnerability was found in Axiomatic Bento4 up to 1.6.0-641. It has been rated as critical. Affected by this issue is the function AP4_DataBufferGetData in the library Ap4DataBuffer.h. The manipulation leads to heap-based buffer overflow. The attack may be launched remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation is known to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. This product is using a rolling release to provide continious delivery. Therefore, no version details for affected nor updated releases are available.",
