The manipulation leads to heap-based buffer overflow. The attack may be launched remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation is known to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. This product is using a rolling release to provide continious delivery. Therefore, no version details for affected nor updated releases are available. Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-121 CWE-119 CWE-79 CWE-126 CWE-805 CWE-190 CWE-125 CWE-122",
