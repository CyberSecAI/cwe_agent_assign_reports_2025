  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-3981 Content\n\nBased on the provided content, this relates to a vulnerability in the \"Internet doctor workstation system\".\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe root cause is the lack of authorization checks on specific API endpoints.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Unauthenticated access to sensitive data.\n*   Information disclosure (specifically, user's name, ID card information, phone number, and medical condition).\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nAttackers can exploit this vulnerability to leak sensitive personal and medical information of users.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Directly accessing the vulnerable API endpoints without authentication.\n*   Specifically, the following endpoints are vulnerable:\n    *   `/ms-hoc-online-prescription/v1/prescription/list`\n    *   `/ms-hoc-online-prescription/v1/prescription/details/`\n    *   `/ms-pocket-hospital/v1/pushConfig/detail/`\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   No specific capabilities are required beyond the ability to send HTTP requests.\n*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\nThe content does not provide specific mitigation or fix details, but implies that implementing proper authentication and authorization checks on the vulnerable API endpoints is necessary.\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n\nThe content provides a Proof of Concept (POC) outlining the steps to exploit the vulnerability:\n\n1.  Access `/ms-pocket-hospital/v1/pushConfig/detail/1` to obtain a `hospitalId`.\n2.  Use the `hospitalId` in a POST request to `/ms-hoc-online-prescription/v1/prescription/list` to obtain a `prescriptionId`.\n3.  Access `/ms-hoc-online-prescription/v1/prescription/details/{prescriptionId}` to retrieve sensitive information.\n\nThe content also identifies the vendor as \u534e\u5353\u79d1\u6280 (Huazhuo Technology) and provides a link to their homepage: <https://www.wowjoy.cn/>. The vulnerable version is V1.0.",

CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) is a child of the broader CWE-284 (Improper Access Control), but CWE-285 is more specific and focuses on flawed authorization logic. CWE-306 (Missing Authentication) was considered because the vulnerability could stem from a complete lack of authentication. CWE-425 (Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')) was considered as a potential consequence of the missing authorization/authentication. The selection of CWE-285 reflects the \"improper authorization\" highlighted in the vulnerability description.\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe425[\"CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe306 -->|PEEROF| cwe285\n    cwe425 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe285\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe285 primary\n    class cwe306,cwe425 secondary\n    class cwe284 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper authorization** (CWE-285), potentially stemming from **missing authentication** (CWE-306). This leads to the ability to directly access resources (CWE-425), resulting in the exposure of sensitive data.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified \"**improper authorization**\" as the root cause, aligning with CWE-285. The retriever results also highlighted CWE-285 as a relevant candidate. The content indicates that the API endpoints are directly accessible without proper authorization checks, allowing attackers to leak sensitive information.\n\nThe graph relationships reinforced the decision to prioritize CWE-285 due to its direct relationship with access control and its specific focus on authorization flaws. CWE-306 was considered because the authorization failure might originate from a complete lack of authentication. CWE-425 was considered a possible result of the authorization issue.\n\nThe selection of CWE-285 is at an appropriate level of specificity because it directly addresses the \"**improper authorization**\" identified in the vulnerability description. While CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) is a broader category, CWE-285 better captures the specific nature of the flaw.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
