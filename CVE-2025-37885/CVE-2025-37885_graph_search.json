Updating the IRTE if and only if the new GSI is an MSI results in KVM leaving an IRTE posting to a vCPU. The dangling IRTE can result in interrupts being incorrectly delivered to the guest, and in the worst case scenario can result in use-after-free, e.g. if the VM is torn down, but the underlying host IRQ isnt freed.
