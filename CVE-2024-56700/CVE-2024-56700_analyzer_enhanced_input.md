## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved media wl128x Fix **atomicity violation** in fmc_send_cmd() Atomicity violation occurs when the fmc_send_cmd() function is executed simultaneously with the modification of the fmdev->resp_skb value. Consider a scenario where, after passing the validity check within the function, a non-null fmdev->resp_skb variable is assigned a null value. This results in an invalid fmdev->resp_skb variable passing the validity check. As seen in the later part of the function, skb = fmdev->resp_skb when the invalid fmdev->resp_skb passes the check, a null pointer dereference error may occur at line 478, evt_hdr = (void *)skb->data To address this issue, it is recommended to include the validity check of fmdev->resp_skb within the locked section of the function. This modification ensures that the value of fmdev->resp_skb does not change during the validation process, thereby maintaining its validity. This possible bug is found by an experimental static analysis tool developed by our team. This tool analyzes the locking APIs to extract function pairs that can be concurrently executed, and then analyzes the instructions in the paired functions to identify possible concurrency bugs including data races and **atomicity violation**s.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content relates to CVE-2024-56700.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** An atomicity violation occurs in the `fmc_send_cmd()` function of the `wl128x` driver. This happens when the function is executed concurrently with modifications to the `fmdev->resp_skb` variable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-   **Atomicity Violation:** The code checks for a valid `fmdev->resp_skb` outside of a locked section, and then uses it after a lock, meaning the value can change between the check and use.
-   **Race Condition:**  Multiple threads could access and modify `fmdev->resp_skb` concurrently. Specifically, one thread might be checking `fmdev->resp_skb` while another sets it to NULL.
-   **Null Pointer Dereference:** A non-null `fmdev->resp_skb` might be set to null by another thread after passing a check resulting in a null pointer dereference on `skb->data` if the value becomes null before being used.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-   The primary impact is a potential null pointer dereference within the `fmc_send_cmd()` function leading to a crash. Specifically, the line `evt_hdr = (void *)skb->data;` at line 478 would trigger the dereference.

**Attack vectors:**
-   The vulnerability can be triggered by any process or thread that uses the wl128x driver and its `fmc_send_cmd()` function. The attacker must be able to trigger the concurrent execution of `fmc_send_cmd()` and another thread modifying `fmdev->resp_skb`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
-   The attacker needs to be able to interact with the wl128x driver such that they can cause the race condition to occur between execution of `fmc_send_cmd()` and another function modifying `fmdev->resp_skb`. This likely implies local access to the system or a remote capability exposed by the system.
-   The ability to control the timing to increase likelihood of race condition triggering.

**Additional details:**
-   The vulnerability was discovered using a static analysis tool that identified potential concurrency issues related to locking APIs.
-   The fix involves moving the `fmdev->resp_skb` validity check inside the locked section to ensure the value does not change between the check and its usage.
- Multiple commits are present in the provided content. These commits address the same issue in different kernel branches/versions and are all related to the fix for the same vulnerability.
