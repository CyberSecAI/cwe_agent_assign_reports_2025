  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-6757:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability lies within the `get_image_alt` function in the Elementor plugin. This function, intended to retrieve the alt text of an image, incorrectly retrieves and exposes post excerpt data or titles of private or password-protected posts when an image is associated with such a post.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n- **Information Exposure:** The `get_image_alt` function does not properly check access permissions before retrieving the post excerpt or title. It bypasses access controls designed to protect private or password-protected content.\n- **Insufficient Access Control:** The function directly accesses post data without proper authorization checks based on user roles and permissions.\n- **Incorrect Data Retrieval:** The function prioritizes `post_excerpt` and `post_title` if the `_wp_attachment_image_alt` meta is not set. This results in unintended information exposure if an image is associated with a private or password-protected post.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n- **Exposure of Sensitive Information:** An attacker can gain access to the excerpt or title of private or password-protected posts, potentially revealing sensitive or confidential content.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n- **Direct Function Call:** An attacker can trigger the vulnerable `get_image_alt` function.\n- **Authenticated Access Required:** The attacker needs to have at least Contributor-level access to the WordPress site to exploit the vulnerability.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n- **WordPress Account:** The attacker needs an account with Contributor or higher level privileges.\n- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Function:** The attacker needs to know about the `get_image_alt` function and its vulnerability.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe vulnerability in Elementor's `get_image_alt` function allows authenticated users with Contributor access or higher to bypass access controls and extract post excerpt or titles from private or password-protected posts. The root cause is that the function retrieves these details without checking proper authorization, resulting in information exposure.",

While more specific child CWEs might exist, the provided information doesn't offer enough detail to pinpoint them accurately. CWE-862 is a potential contributing factor (missing authorization) that could lead to the exposure of sensitive information. The abstraction levels of the CWEs were considered, opting for the Class level due to the lack of precise details for more specific Base or Variant mappings.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe862 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe862 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **missing authorization** (CWE-862), which leads to the **exposure of sensitive information** (CWE-200) like excerpt data or titles of private/password-protected posts. The `get_image_alt` function **does not properly** check access permissions before retrieving the post excerpt or title. It bypasses access controls designed to protect private or password-protected content.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified the **Basic Information Exposure** as the primary weakness. The retriever results suggested CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization), CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data), and CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor). After reviewing the vulnerability description, CVE reference, and CWE specifications, CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) was chosen as the primary CWE because it directly reflects the impact of the vulnerability. The **root cause** is the **insufficient access control** in the `get_image_alt` function which is a **missing authorization** (CWE-862) check.\nThe selection of CWE-200 is based on the evidence that the vulnerability allows authenticated attackers to extract either excerpt data or titles of private or password-protected posts, which constitutes **exposure of sensitive information**.\nThe choice of a Class-level CWE (CWE-200) is due to the limited information available to pinpoint a more specific Base or Variant CWE. However, it accurately represents the high-level weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this
