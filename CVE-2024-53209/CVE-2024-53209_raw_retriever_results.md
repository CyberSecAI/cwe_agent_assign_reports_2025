# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-53209
## Query
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved bnxt_en Fix receive ring space parameters when XDP is active The MTU setting at the time an XDP multi-buffer is attached determines whether the aggregation ring will be used and the rx_skb_func handler. This is done in bnxt_set_rx_skb_mode(). If the MTU is later changed, the aggregation ring setting may need to be changed and it may become out-of-sync with the settings initially done in bnxt_set_rx_skb_mode(). This may result in random memory corruption and crashes as the HW may DMA data larger than the allocated buffer size, such as

## Keyphrases
- **weakness**: 'random memory corruption'
