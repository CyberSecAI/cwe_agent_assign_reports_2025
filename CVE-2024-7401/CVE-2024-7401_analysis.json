It describes a Netskope Client enrollment bypass vulnerability due to the usage of a static token (\"Orgkey\") as an authentication parameter.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe Netskope client enrollment process used a static token as authentication, which, if leaked, could not be revoked or rotated, allowing a malicious actor to impersonate and enroll.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- Use of static, non-rotatable, non-revocable authentication token during client enrollment.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- Malicious actor could enroll Netskope client using leaked token from a customer's tenant and impersonate users.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- Obtaining a leaked static token.\n- Using the static token to enroll Netskope client from a customer's tenant\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- Attacker needs the leaked static \"Orgkey\" token.\n- Attacker requires knowledge of the tenant URL to enroll.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n- The vulnerability is addressed by enforcing \"Secure Enrollment,\" which mandates strict authentication parameters during client enrollment.\n- Netskope recommends enabling \"Enforce authentication of Netskope Client Enrollment\" and optionally \"Enforce encryption of initial configuration of Netskope client\" in all tenants.\n- Multi-token support is introduced with version 122.0.0, allowing the creation of multiple authentication and encryption tokens.",

CWE-798 is a Base CWE that directly addresses the use of hardcoded credentials, while CWE-259 and CWE-321 are more specific variants. Since the description refers to a **static token**, not specifically a password or cryptographic key, CWE-798 is a more appropriate fit. CWE-798 is also related to authentication issues, making CWE-287 and CWE-306 potential secondary considerations.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n\n    cwe287 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n\n    class cwe798 primary\n    class cwe287,cwe306 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **use of a static token (Orgkey)**, leading to the ability to bypass authentication and impersonate users.\n  - Root Cause: **Use of static token Orgkey** (CWE-798)\n  - Weakness: Improper Authentication (CWE-287) / Missing Authentication (CWE-306)\n  - Impact: Enroll NSClient from customers tenant and impersonate user\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the **root cause** of the vulnerability and mapping it to the most specific CWE. The vulnerability description and CVE summary clearly indicate that the **use of a static token \"Orgkey\"** is the primary flaw. This directly aligns with CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials. While the vulnerability also impacts authentication, the root cause is the hardcoded credential itself. The retriever results also suggest CWE-798, lending further support to this conclusion.\n\nThe final decision is based on the evidence that the application uses a **static token**, which is a form of hardcoded credential, for authentication. CWE-798 is chosen as the **primary CWE** because it directly addresses the **root cause**. CWE-287 and CWE-306 are considered as secondary because they describe the consequence of this vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
