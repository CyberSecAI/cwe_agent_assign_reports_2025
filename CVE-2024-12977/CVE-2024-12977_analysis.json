  "description": "A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, was found in PHPGurukul Complaint Management System 1.0. This affects an unknown part of the file /admin/state.php. The manipulation of the argument state leads to **sql injection**. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection\n\n**Root Cause:**\n- The application directly incorporates user-supplied input from the `state` parameter into SQL queries without proper sanitization or validation.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Lack of input sanitization.\n- Lack of input validation.\n- Direct embedding of user input into SQL queries.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Unauthorized Data Access:** Attackers can retrieve sensitive information.\n- **Data Breach:** Confidential data, including user information, can be exposed.\n- **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can alter or delete existing data.\n- **System Compromise:** Potential for complete takeover of the application and underlying server.\n- **Denial of Service:** Disruption of services by overloading the database with malicious queries.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- HTTP GET/POST request to `/admin/state.php`\n- The `state` parameter is vulnerable\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.\n- No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.\n\n**Technical Details**\n- The vulnerability is in the `/admin/state.php` file.\n- The `state` parameter is vulnerable.\n- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) uses a time-based SQL injection using `SLEEP(5)` function to confirm the vulnerability.\n- The PoC uses `sqlmap` to demonstrate exploitation.\n\n**Remediation Recommendations:**\n- Implement prepared statements and parameterized queries.\n- Enforce input validation and sanitization.\n- Adopt the principle of least privilege for database user accounts.\n- Conduct regular security audits and code reviews.\n- Implement Web Application Firewalls (WAF).\n\nThis information is more detailed than the typical CVE description, which would usually only provide a high level overview of the vulnerability.",

The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the application directly incorporates user-supplied input from the `state` parameter into SQL queries without proper sanitization or validation. This directly aligns with **CWE-89's** description of constructing an SQL command using externally-influenced input without proper neutralization. The retriever results also identify **CWE-89** as the top candidate. There is strong evidence supporting this classification.\n\nOther CWEs Considered and Rejected:\n\n*   CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting'): While input neutralization is a concern, the core issue is the direct injection into an SQL query, not web page generation.\n*   CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type: Not relevant as the vulnerability does not involve file uploads.\n*   CWE-1336: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine: Not relevant as the vulnerability does not involve template engines.\n*   CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing'): Not relevant as there is no mention of authorization issues, only **SQL Injection**\n\nThe selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because it accurately captures the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL command.",
