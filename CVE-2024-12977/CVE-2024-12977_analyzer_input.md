# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-12977

## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, was found in PHPGurukul Complaint Management System 1.0. This affects an unknown part of the file /admin/state.php. The manipulation of the argument state leads to **sql injection**. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **sql injection**
- **product:** PHPGurukul Complaint Management System
- **version:** 1.0
- **component:** /admin/state.php

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Root Cause:**
- The application directly incorporates user-supplied input from the `state` parameter into SQL queries without proper sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses:**
- Lack of input sanitization.
- Lack of input validation.
- Direct embedding of user input into SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Data Access:** Attackers can retrieve sensitive information.
- **Data Breach:** Confidential data, including user information, can be exposed.
- **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can alter or delete existing data.
- **System Compromise:** Potential for complete takeover of the application and underlying server.
- **Denial of Service:** Disruption of services by overloading the database with malicious queries.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP GET/POST request to `/admin/state.php`
- The `state` parameter is vulnerable

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
- No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Technical Details**
- The vulnerability is in the `/admin/state.php` file.
- The `state` parameter is vulnerable.
- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) uses a time-based SQL injection using `SLEEP(5)` function to confirm the vulnerability.
- The PoC uses `sqlmap` to demonstrate exploitation.

**Remediation Recommendations:**
- Implement prepared statements and parameterized queries.
- Enforce input validation and sanitization.
- Adopt the principle of least privilege for database user accounts.
- Conduct regular security audits and code reviews.
- Implement Web Application Firewalls (WAF).
