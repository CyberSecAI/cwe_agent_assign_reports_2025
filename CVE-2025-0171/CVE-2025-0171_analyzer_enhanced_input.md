## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Root Cause:**
- The `deleteuser.php` script directly incorporates user-supplied input (`$_POST['id']`) into a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization. Specifically, the vulnerable line is: `mysqli_query($conn,"delete from \`user\` where userid='$id'");`

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a time-based blind SQL injection. Because the `id` parameter is not sanitized, an attacker can inject malicious SQL code to manipulate the database query and use `SLEEP()` function to confirm injection and extract information.
- **Lack of Input Validation:**  The code lacks input validation, which is the root cause of the SQL injection vulnerability.
- **Session privilege escalation:** The document notes a session privilege escalation vulnerability that is not detailed in the provided information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database Manipulation:** An attacker can use SQL injection to manipulate the database, which could include deleting or modifying data.
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database by exploiting the blind SQL injection vulnerability, even without seeing the direct results of the query. The provided exploit code demonstrates extracting the database name.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  By using functions like `SLEEP()`, the attacker can cause delays in database responses, potentially leading to a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker sends a crafted POST request to the `deleteuser.php` endpoint, injecting malicious SQL code in the `id` parameter within the request body.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the application.
- **Knowledge of Target:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerable `deleteuser.php` script and its structure.
- **Session Management:** The attacker also needs to have a valid `PHPSESSID` cookie to be able to send a request to the vulnerable endpoint.

**Additional Information:**

-   The provided content includes a Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrating the time-based SQL injection using the `SLEEP()` function and a Python exploit code to retrieve the database name, demonstrating the impact of the vulnerability.
-   The PoC and exploit code clearly illustrate how to leverage the vulnerability to perform time-based SQL injection by sending a modified `id` parameter with SQL injection payloads.
-   The github content provides more detailed information than a typical CVE description, including the exact vulnerable code, a PoC, and a python script to exploit the vulnerability.
