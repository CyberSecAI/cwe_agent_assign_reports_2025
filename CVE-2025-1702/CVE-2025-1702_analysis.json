CWE-89 is a base level CWE, while CWE-116 is a class-level CWE, suggesting a more specific weakness is CWE-89.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    cwe116[\"CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\"]\n\n    cwe89 -->|CHILD_OF| cwe116\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe89 primary\n    class cwe116 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query** which leads to **Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') CWE-89**, enabling unauthenticated attackers to extract sensitive information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis focuses on the provided vulnerability description and associated details to determine the most appropriate CWE mapping.\n\nThe primary weakness is identified as **Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') CWE-89**. This is supported by the **rootcause** statement: **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**, which directly aligns with the description of CWE-89. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this, stating \"Insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query\" as the root cause, resulting in \"Time-based SQL Injection.\"\n\nCWE-116, Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output, is considered as a secondary CWE. The **insufficient escaping** mentioned in the description relates to encoding/escaping. However, CWE-89 is more specific to SQL injection and accurately captures the vulnerability's nature.\n\nThe relationship analysis shows CWE-89 as a child of CWE-116, meaning it is more specific.
