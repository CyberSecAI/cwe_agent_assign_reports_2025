# Analysis for CVE-2024-48914

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-23 | Relative Path Traversal | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE. The vulnerability stems from the usage of `decodeURIComponent(req.path)` directly in `path.join` without any path normalization. This allows path traversal attacks |
| CWE-400 | Uncontrolled Resource Consumption | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. Malformed URI characters in the asset URL can crash the server due to an error in `decodeURIComponent`. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-23, which describes the path traversal vulnerability. CWE-400 is the denial of service due to malformed requests.

## Vulnerability Chain
1.  **Root Cause:** **Improper neutralization of path delimiters** in user-controlled input (CWE-23).
2.  **Impact:** Arbitrary file read.
3.  **Root Cause:** **Improper handling of malformed URI characters** leading to a crash (CWE-400).
4.  **Impact:** Denial of Service.

## Summary of Analysis
The primary vulnerability is **Relative Path Traversal (CWE-23)**. The vulnerability description clearly states that an attacker can craft a request to traverse the server file system and retrieve arbitrary files. The root cause is the **lack of proper sanitization of user-provided paths**, specifically the use of `decodeURIComponent(req.path)` in `path.join` without normalization, as mentioned in the CVE Reference Links Content Summary.

Additionally, there's a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability due to malformed URI characters. This is classified as **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400)**, as the malformed input leads to excessive resource consumption, crashing the server.

The retriever results list CWE-22 and CWE-23 which are related. CWE-23 is more specific and thus more appropriate.

CWE-918, CWE-212, CWE-201, CWE-863, CWE-639, CWE-306, CWE-502 and CWE-226 were considered but are not as closely aligned with the specific vulnerabilities described. They are either related to different attack vectors (SSRF, Deserialization) or different types of weaknesses (information leakage, authorization issues).

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web server receives a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as ".." that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently ensuring that the resulting data will be valid.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-346: Origin Validation Error
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly verify that the source of data or communication is valid.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.

- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
