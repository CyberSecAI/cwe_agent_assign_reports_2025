# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-38365

## Vulnerability Description
btcd is an alternative full node bitcoin implementation written in Go (golang). The btcd Bitcoin client (versions 0.10 to 0.24) did not correctly re-implement Bitcoin Cores FindAndDelete() functionality. This logic is consensus-critical the difference in behavior with the other Bitcoin clients can lead to btcd clients accepting an invalid Bitcoin block (or rejecting a valid one). This consensus failure can be leveraged to cause a chain split (accepting an invalid Bitcoin block) or be exploited to DoS the btcd nodes (rejecting a valid Bitcoin block). An attacker can create a standard transaction where FindAndDelete doesnt return a match but removeOpCodeByData does making btcd get a different sighash, leading to a chain split. Importantly, this vulnerability can be exploited remotely by any Bitcoin user and does not require any hash power. This is because the difference in behavior can be triggered by a standard Bitcoin transaction, that is a transaction which gets relayed through the P2P network before it gets included in a Bitcoin block. `removeOpcodeByData(script []byte, dataToRemove []byte)` removes any data pushes from `script` that contain `dataToRemove`. However, `FindAndDelete` only removes exact matches. So for example, with `script = ` and `dataToRemove = data` btcd will remove both data pushes but Bitcoin Cores `FindAndDelete` only removes the first `` push. This has been patched in btcd version v0.24.2. Users are advised to upgrad

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **improper re-implementation of FindAndDelete() functionality**
- **impact:** accept invalid block and reject valid block and chain split and DoS
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** btcd Bitcoin client
- **version:** 0.10 to 0.24

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-38365

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from an incorrect implementation of the `FindAndDelete` function in `btcd` (Bitcoin client) versions prior to 0.24.2. This function is used during signature verification for legacy (non-segwit) transactions to remove the signature from the script before creating the sighash.
- `btcd`'s `removeOpcodeByData` function, which was meant to be equivalent to Bitcoin Core's `FindAndDelete`, incorrectly removes any data push from the script that *contains* the signature data, instead of only removing exact matches, which is what Bitcoin Core's `FindAndDelete` does.
- This discrepancy in how the signature is removed before generating the sighash leads to different sighash values, and thus a potential for chain splits and denial-of-service attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Incorrect Implementation:**  `removeOpcodeByData` in `btcd` performs a fuzzy match instead of an exact match when removing signature data, which does not align with the consensus rules of Bitcoin Core.
- **Consensus Failure:** The difference in behavior between `btcd` and Bitcoin Core (and other Bitcoin clients) creates a consensus failure, where a block or transaction could be considered valid by one node and invalid by another, leading to a chain split or DoS attack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Chain Split:** Attackers can craft a standard transaction that exploits the `FindAndDelete` bug, causing `btcd` nodes to accept an invalid block, splitting the blockchain.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Attackers can cause vulnerable `btcd` nodes to reject valid blocks, effectively DoSing the nodes and disrupting the network.
- **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by any Bitcoin user through the standard Bitcoin P2P network.
- **No Hash Power Required:** The vulnerability doesn't require any special hash power to exploit because it is triggered by crafting a specific, valid Bitcoin transaction that exploits the bug.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted Transactions:** An attacker creates a transaction with a specific script containing a signature check and an extraneous data push that includes the signature (with additional padding data) which would be valid on Bitcoin Core nodes and invalid on vulnerable `btcd` nodes due to the `FindAndDelete` difference.
- **Standard P2P Network:** The crafted transaction is relayed through the normal Bitcoin peer-to-peer network.
- The vulnerability exists in the script interpreter during signature verification for legacy transactions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Bitcoin User:** Any Bitcoin user can exploit this vulnerability; no special privileges or access are needed.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs access to the Bitcoin P2P network to broadcast the crafted transaction.
- **Transaction Crafting Knowledge:** The attacker needs the ability to craft a transaction with the specific script that exploits the `FindAndDelete` bug (as described above). This includes crafting the script in such a way that the signature check will succeed on Bitcoin Core but fail on `btcd` because of the different sighash calculations.
- **Public Key Recovery:** As noted in the Delving Bitcoin discussion, public key recovery is used to construct a script where the signature check will pass on Bitcoin Core and fail on btcd, because of the differences in how `FindAndDelete`/`removeOpcodeByData` operate

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was introduced in commit `76339baf6c9407b073828245e3458f4df35190ae` in 2014.
- The fix was included in `btcd` version v0.24.2.
- The vulnerability affects versions 0.10 to 0.24 of `btcd`.
