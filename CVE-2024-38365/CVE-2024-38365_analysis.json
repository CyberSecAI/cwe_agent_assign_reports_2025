  "description": "btcd is an alternative full node bitcoin implementation written in Go (golang). The btcd Bitcoin client (versions 0.10 to 0.24) did not correctly re-implement Bitcoin Cores FindAndDelete() functionality. This logic is consensus-critical the difference in behavior with the other Bitcoin clients can lead to btcd clients accepting an invalid Bitcoin block (or rejecting a valid one). This consensus failure can be leveraged to cause a chain split (accepting an invalid Bitcoin block) or be exploited to DoS the btcd nodes (rejecting a valid Bitcoin block). An attacker can create a standard transaction where FindAndDelete doesnt return a match but removeOpCodeByData does making btcd get a different sighash, leading to a chain split. Importantly, this vulnerability can be exploited remotely by any Bitcoin user and does not require any hash power. This is because the difference in behavior can be triggered by a standard Bitcoin transaction, that is a transaction which gets relayed through the P2P network before it gets included in a Bitcoin block. `removeOpcodeByData(script []byte, dataToRemove []byte)` removes any data pushes from `script` that contain `dataToRemove`. However, `FindAndDelete` only removes exact matches. So for example, with `script = ` and `dataToRemove = data` btcd will remove both data pushes but Bitcoin Cores `FindAndDelete` only removes the first `` push. This has been patched in btcd version v0.24.2. Users are advised to upgrad",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-38365\n\n**Root Cause:**\n- The vulnerability stems from an incorrect implementation of the `FindAndDelete` function in `btcd` (Bitcoin client) versions prior to 0.24.2. This function is used during signature verification for legacy (non-segwit) transactions to remove the signature from the script before creating the sighash.\n- `btcd`'s `removeOpcodeByData` function, which was meant to be equivalent to Bitcoin Core's `FindAndDelete`, incorrectly removes any data push from the script that *contains* the signature data, instead of only removing exact matches, which is what Bitcoin Core's `FindAndDelete` does.\n- This discrepancy in how the signature is removed before generating the sighash leads to different sighash values, and thus a potential for chain splits and denial-of-service attacks.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n- **Incorrect Implementation:**  `removeOpcodeByData` in `btcd` performs a fuzzy match instead of an exact match when removing signature data, which does not align with the consensus rules of Bitcoin Core.\n- **Consensus Failure:** The difference in behavior between `btcd` and Bitcoin Core (and other Bitcoin clients) creates a consensus failure, where a block or transaction could be considered valid by one node and invalid by another, leading to a chain split or DoS attack.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Chain Split:** Attackers can craft a standard transaction that exploits the `FindAndDelete` bug, causing `btcd` nodes to accept an invalid block, splitting the blockchain.\n- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Attackers can cause vulnerable `btcd` nodes to reject valid blocks, effectively DoSing the nodes and disrupting the network.\n- **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by any Bitcoin user through the standard Bitcoin P2P network.\n- **No Hash Power Required:** The vulnerability doesn't require any special hash power to exploit because it is triggered by crafting a specific, valid Bitcoin transaction that exploits the bug.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Crafted Transactions:** An attacker creates a transaction with a specific script containing a signature check and an extraneous data push that includes the signature (with additional padding data) which would be valid on Bitcoin Core nodes and invalid on vulnerable `btcd` nodes due to the `FindAndDelete` difference.\n- **Standard P2P Network:** The crafted transaction is relayed through the normal Bitcoin peer-to-peer network.\n- The vulnerability exists in the script interpreter during signature verification for legacy transactions.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Bitcoin User:** Any Bitcoin user can exploit this vulnerability; no special privileges or access are needed.\n- **Network Access:** The attacker needs access to the Bitcoin P2P network to broadcast the crafted transaction.\n- **Transaction Crafting Knowledge:** The attacker needs the ability to craft a transaction with the specific script that exploits the `FindAndDelete` bug (as described above). This includes crafting the script in such a way that the signature check will succeed on Bitcoin Core but fail on `btcd` because of the different sighash calculations.\n- **Public Key Recovery:** As noted in the Delving Bitcoin discussion, public key recovery is used to construct a script where the signature check will pass on Bitcoin Core and fail on btcd, because of the differences in how `FindAndDelete`/`removeOpcodeByData` operate\n\n**Additional Details:**\n- The vulnerability was introduced in commit `76339baf6c9407b073828245e3458f4df35190ae` in 2014.\n- The fix was included in `btcd` version v0.24.2.\n- The vulnerability affects versions 0.10 to 0.24 of `btcd`.\n\nThe provided content gives more detail than the basic CVE description by explaining the technical specifics of the bug.",

CWE-347 (Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature) is a child of CWE-345 (Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity). While CWE-345 is a broader class, CWE-347 is more specific to the cryptographic aspect of the vulnerability, making it a better fit. CWE-347 is related to CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) in that the lack of proper input validation can lead to issues with signature verification. CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) is a peer of CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) and is considered since signature validation could be considered a form of authentication.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe347[\"CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe345[\"CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\"]\n    \n    cwe347 -->|CHILDOF| cwe345\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe347 primary\n    class cwe20,cwe863 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper re-implementation of FindAndDelete() functionality**, which leads to **improper verification of the cryptographic signature** (CWE-347). This then causes a consensus failure, allowing attackers to either cause a chain split (accepting an invalid block) or DoS the btcd nodes (rejecting a valid block). Improper input validation (CWE-20) and incorrect authorization (CWE-863) could also be factors.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe primary weakness is the **improper re-implementation of FindAndDelete() functionality**, which directly leads to signature verification failures. The evidence for this is: \"btcd Bitcoin client (versions 0.10 to 0.24) did not correctly re-implement Bitcoin Cores FindAndDelete() functionality...difference in behavior with the other Bitcoin clients can lead to btcd clients accepting an invalid Bitcoin block (or rejecting a valid one).\" This directly supports CWE-347. The graph relationships influenced the decision to include CWE-20 and CWE-863 as secondary considerations, as input validation and authorization issues can often be related to signature verification problems. The selected CWEs are at an optimal level of specificity, as CWE-347 directly addresses the cryptographic signature verification issue, while CWE-20 and CWE-863 cover related aspects of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nAn algorithm in a product has an inefficient worst-case computational complexity that may be detrimental to system performance and can be triggered by an attacker, typically using crafted manipulations that ensure that the worst case is being reached.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not selected*: This vulnerability is not about algorithmic complexity, but about incorrect implementation.\n\n## CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an algorithm that produces a digest (output value) that does not meet security expectations for a hash function that allows an adversary to reasonably determine the original input (preimage attack), find another input that can produce the same hash (2nd preimage attack), or find multiple inputs that evaluate to the same hash (birthday attack).\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not selected*: While hashes are involved, the core issue is not the use of a weak hash function, but the incorrect handling of signature data.\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
