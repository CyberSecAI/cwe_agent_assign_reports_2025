  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved usb dwc3 core remove lock of otg mode during gadget suspend/resume to avoid **deadlock** When config CONFIG_USB_DWC3_DUAL_ROLE is selected, and trigger system to enter suspend status with below command echo mem > /sys/power/state There will be a **deadlock** issue occurring. Detailed invoking path as below dwc3_suspend_common() spin_lock_irqsave(&dwc->lock, flags) lock, flags) gadget_driver is NULL or not. It causes the following code is executed and **deadlock** occurs when trying to get the spinlock. In fact, the root cause is the commit 5265397f9442(usb dwc3 **Remove DWC3 locking during gadget suspend/resume**) that forgot to remove the lock of otg mode. So, remove the redundant lock of otg mode during gadget suspend/resume.",

  "reference_content": "The provided content describes a fix for a deadlock vulnerability in the Linux kernel's DWC3 USB driver.\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe root cause is a missing removal of a spinlock during gadget suspend/resume operations when the DWC3 controller operates in dual-role mode, specifically when acting as a USB device. The commit 5265397f9442 (\"usb: dwc3: Remove DWC3 locking during gadget suspend/resume\") removed some locks but forgot to remove the otg mode lock, causing a deadlock.\n\n**Vulnerabilities/Weaknesses:**\n- **Deadlock:** The code attempts to acquire the same spinlock (`dwc->lock`) twice within the `dwc3_suspend_common` function during suspend, resulting in a deadlock. This occurs because `dwc3_gadget_suspend` calls `dwc3_gadget_soft_disconnect` which attempts to acquire the same spinlock a second time.\n- **Missing Lock Removal:**  The primary weakness is that commit 5265397f9442 did not completely remove all relevant locks during gadget suspend/resume, specifically the lock related to the otg mode, leaving a double lock situation in the gadget suspend path.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **System Hang/Deadlock:** The system becomes unresponsive when entering suspend mode because the kernel threads are blocked waiting on the same lock.\n- **Denial of Service:** The deadlock prevents the system from suspending correctly and can cause a denial of service, as the device becomes unusable and might require a hard reset.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **System Suspend:** The vulnerability is triggered by putting the system into suspend state using `echo mem > /sys/power/state`.\n- **Dual-Role Configuration:** The system must have the `CONFIG_USB_DWC3_DUAL_ROLE` option enabled for the vulnerability to be exposed.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **User-level Access:** The attacker needs user-level access to the system to execute the command to trigger the system suspend.\n- **System Configuration:** The system must be configured to enable dual role support for the DWC3 USB controller.",

Since the vulnerability description explicitly mentions a **deadlock** caused by improper locking during suspend/resume operations, CWE-833 becomes the most specific and appropriate choice as the primary CWE. CWE-413 is related to the root cause of the **deadlock**, i.e. improper locking, and CWE-667 is a more general classification of the same issue.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe833[\"CWE-833: Deadlock\"]\n    cwe413[\"CWE-413: Improper Resource Locking\"]\n    cwe667[\"CWE-667: Improper Locking\"]\n    \n    cwe833 -->|CHILDOF| cwe667\n    cwe413 -->|CHILDOF| cwe667\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe833 primary\n    class cwe413,cwe667 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **missing lock removal** (implicit in the description), leading to **improper locking** and ultimately resulting in a **deadlock**.\n\n1.  **Missing Lock Removal:** The initial commit failed to remove all necessary locks during suspend/resume.\n2.  **Improper Locking (CWE-413):** The incomplete lock removal leads to a double locking situation.\n3.  **Deadlock (CWE-833):** The double locking causes the system to enter a **deadlock** state when suspending.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is primarily based on the provided vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary. The description clearly states that the vulnerability is a **deadlock** caused by a missing lock removal during suspend/resume operations.\n\nThe retriever results also suggest CWE-667 (**Improper Locking**) and CWE-833 (**Deadlock**) as potential candidates. Given the explicit mention of a **deadlock** and the root cause being a locking issue, CWE-833 is the most specific and appropriate primary CWE. CWE-413 (Improper Resource Locking) serves as a good secondary CWE since it describes the root cause of the deadlock.\n\nThe relationship analysis further supports this decision, as CWE-833 is a child of CWE-667 and closely related to CWE-413, indicating a more specific instance of **improper locking**. The evidence from the vulnerability description includes phrases like \"remove lock of otg mode during gadget suspend/resume to avoid **deadlock**\", \"There will be a **deadlock** issue occurring\" and \"causes the following code is executed and **deadlock** occurs when trying to get the spinlock\" which strongly support the selection of CWE-833.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-833 directly addresses the vulnerability, while CWE-413 and CWE-667 provide context about the underlying locking issue.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-833: Deadlock\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains multiple threads or executable segments that are waiting for each other to release a necessary lock, resulting in **deadlock**.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
