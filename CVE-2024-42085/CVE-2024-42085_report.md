# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-42085

## Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved usb dwc3 core remove lock of otg mode during gadget suspend/resume to avoid **deadlock** When config CONFIG_USB_DWC3_DUAL_ROLE is selected, and trigger system to enter suspend status with below command echo mem > /sys/power/state There will be a **deadlock** issue occurring. Detailed invoking path as below dwc3_suspend_common() spin_lock_irqsave(&dwc->lock, flags) lock, flags) gadget_driver is NULL or not. It causes the following code is executed and **deadlock** occurs when trying to get the spinlock. In fact, the root cause is the commit 5265397f9442(usb dwc3 **Remove DWC3 locking during gadget suspend/resume**) that forgot to remove the lock of otg mode. So, remove the redundant lock of otg mode during gadget suspend/resume.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Rootcause:** Remove DWC3 locking during gadget suspend/resume
- **Weakness:** deadlock
- **Vector:** echo mem > /sys/power/state
- **Product:** Linux kernel
- **Component:** usb dwc3 core

*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that impacted my decision was the hierarchical relationship between CWE-667 (Improper Locking) and its potential children, specifically CWE-413 (Improper Resource Locking) and CWE-833 (**Deadlock**). Since the vulnerability description explicitly mentions a **deadlock** caused by improper locking during suspend/resume operations, CWE-833 becomes the most specific and appropriate choice as the primary CWE. CWE-413 is related to the root cause of the **deadlock**, i.e. improper locking, and CWE-667 is a more general classification of the same issue.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with a **missing lock removal** (implicit in the description), leading to **improper locking** and ultimately resulting in a **deadlock**.

1.  **Missing Lock Removal:** The initial commit failed to remove all necessary locks during suspend/resume.
2.  **Improper Locking (CWE-413):** The incomplete lock removal leads to a double locking situation.
3.  **Deadlock (CWE-833):** The double locking causes the system to enter a **deadlock** state when suspending.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is primarily based on the provided vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary. The description clearly states that the vulnerability is a **deadlock** caused by a missing lock removal during suspend/resume operations.

The retriever results also suggest CWE-667 (**Improper Locking**) and CWE-833 (**Deadlock**) as potential candidates. Given the explicit mention of a **deadlock** and the root cause being a locking issue, CWE-833 is the most specific and appropriate primary CWE. CWE-413 (Improper Resource Locking) serves as a good secondary CWE since it describes the root cause of the deadlock.

The relationship analysis further supports this decision, as CWE-833 is a child of CWE-667 and closely related to CWE-413, indicating a more specific instance of **improper locking**. The evidence from the vulnerability description includes phrases like "remove lock of otg mode during gadget suspend/resume to avoid **deadlock**", "There will be a **deadlock** issue occurring" and "causes the following code is executed and **deadlock** occurs when trying to get the spinlock" which strongly support the selection of CWE-833.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-833 directly addresses the vulnerability, while CWE-413 and CWE-667 provide context about the underlying locking issue.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-833: Deadlock
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product contains multiple threads or executable segments that are waiting for each other to release a necessary lock, resulting in **deadlock**.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-667: Improper Locking
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.
