  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved page_pool avoid infinite loop to schedule delayed worker We noticed the kworker in page_pool_release_retry() was waken up repeatedly and infinitely in production because of the buggy driver causing the inflight less than 0 and warning us in page_pool_inflight()[1]. Since the inflight value goes negative, it means we should not expect the whole page_pool to get back to work normally. This patch mitigates the adverse effect by not rescheduling the kworker when detecting the inflight negative in page_pool_release_retry().

CWE-835 is a child of CWE-834 (Excessive Iteration), indicating a more general category. CWE-755 is a high-level class and therefore less specific.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe835[\"CWE-835: Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')\"]\n    cwe834[\"CWE-834: Excessive Iteration\"]\n    cwe755[\"CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\"]\n\n    cwe835 -->|CHILDOF| cwe834\n    cwe835 -->|CANBE caused by| cwe755\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe835 primary\n    class cwe755 secondary\n    class cwe834 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a buggy driver that causes a negative inflight value, which then leads to the **infinite loop** due to repeated rescheduling of the kworker. The **improper handling of the exceptional condition** (negative inflight value) is a contributing factor.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary vulnerability is an **infinite loop**, identified as CWE-835. The evidence for this comes from the vulnerability description stating \"page_pool avoid **infinite loop** to schedule delayed worker\". The call trace also shows repeated calls, indicating the loop. The negative inflight value is the reason the loop occurs, so **improper handling of this exceptional condition** contributes to the loop.\n\nCWE-835 is a Base level CWE, which is preferred.\n\nCWE-755 was considered, but it's too general. The specific exceptional condition isn't elaborated upon in the description.\n\nOther CWEs were considered but ultimately deemed less relevant:\n*   CWE-1284 and CWE-1285 are related to input validation, which isn't the primary issue here.\n*   CWE-362 is related to race conditions, but the description does not indicate that.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-835: Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains an iteration or loop with an exit condition that cannot be reached, i.e., an infinite loop.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check.
