  "description": "A vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, was found in TOTOLINK A3700R 9.1.2u.5822_B20200513. Affected is an unknown function of the file /wizard.html of the component Password Reset Handler. The manipulation leads to **improper access controls**. It is possible to launch the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The identifier of this vulnerability is VDB-272568. NOTE The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\n*   The vulnerability stems from **Incorrect Access Control** in the TOTOLINK A3700R router firmware. Specifically, the `/wizard.html` and `/phone/wizard.html` pages lack proper authentication checks.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **Missing Authentication:** The web pages responsible for changing passwords (`/wizard.html` and `/phone/wizard.html`) can be accessed without prior authentication. This bypasses the intended access control mechanisms.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   **Unauthorized Password Reset:** Attackers can reset critical passwords without needing any credentials, leading to a complete loss of control over the device. This can allow for unauthorized access to the network, modification of device settings, and potentially other malicious actions.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   **Direct URL Access:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by directly visiting the vulnerable URLs (`/wizard.html` or `/phone/wizard.html`) in a web browser.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to access the router's web interface. This could be from the local network or potentially remotely if the router's management interface is exposed to the internet.\n*   **No Credentials Required:** The attacker does not need any valid user credentials to exploit this vulnerability.\n\n**Summary of Vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker to reset the device passwords by simply accessing specific URLs, which means that the access control for these critical pages is missing. This could result in full control of the device.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n*   **Affected version:** TOTOLINK A3700R V9.1.2u.5822\\_B20200513\n*   **Proof of Concept (POC):** The provided images show the vulnerable pages being accessed in a web browser.",

CWE-425, a peer of CWE-288 (Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel), is considered as a secondary CWE because the lack of authentication directly leads to forced browsing of sensitive functionalities. The base abstraction level for both CWEs is suitable because the provided information clearly points to specific implementation flaws.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe425[\"CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\"]\n    cwe288[\"CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel\"]\n\n    cwe425 -->|CHILDOF| cwe288\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe306 primary\n    class cwe425 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authentication** (CWE-306) for critical functions, specifically the password reset functionality. This allows for **direct requests** (CWE-425) to the `/wizard.html` endpoint, leading to **unauthorized password reset** and complete device compromise.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-306 as the primary weakness due to the explicit **missing authentication** for the password reset functionality. The vulnerability description clearly states that the `/wizard.html` page can be accessed without authentication, leading to unauthorized password resets. This aligns perfectly with the definition of CWE-306.\n\nThe \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section further reinforces this by stating, \"The vulnerability stems from **Incorrect Access Control**... Specifically, the `/wizard.html` and `/phone/wizard.html` pages lack proper authentication checks\" and \"**Missing Authentication:** The web pages responsible for changing passwords can be accessed without prior authentication. This bypasses the intended access control mechanisms.\"\n\nCWE-425 (Direct Request) is included as a secondary CWE because the **missing authentication** allows an attacker to directly request the protected functionality without proper authorization checks.\n\nOther CWEs like CWE-79 and CWE-89 were considered but rejected as they are related to input validation and injection vulnerabilities, which are not the primary issue in this case. The focus here is on the **missing authentication** mechanism, making CWE-306 the most appropriate primary classification. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, providing a clear and accurate representation of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 947.80\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not perform any authentication for functionality that requires a provable user identity or consumes a significant amount of resources.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 2.36\n**Source**: graph\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.",

        "extended_description": "\n\nThis weakness can lead to a vulnerability in environments in which the attacker does not have direct access to the operating system, such as in web applications. Alternately, if the weakness occurs in a privileged program, it could allow the attacker to specify commands that normally would not be accessible, or to call alternate commands with privileges that the attacker does not have. The problem is exacerbated if the compromised process does not follow the principle of least privilege, because the attacker-controlled commands may run with special system privileges that increases the amount of damage.\n\n\nThere are at least two subtypes of OS command injection:\n\n\n  - The application intends to execute a single, fixed program that is under its own control. It intends to use externally-supplied inputs as arguments to that program. For example, the program might use system(\"nslookup [HOSTNAME]\") to run nslookup and allow the user to supply a HOSTNAME, which is used as an argument. Attackers cannot prevent nslookup from executing. However, if the program does not remove command separators from the HOSTNAME argument, attackers could place the separators into the arguments, which allows them to execute their own program after nslookup has finished executing.\n\n  - The application accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run, as well as which commands to use. The application simply redirects this entire command to the operating system. For example, the program might use \"exec([COMMAND])\" to execute the [COMMAND] that was supplied by the user. If the COMMAND is under attacker control, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or programs. If the command is being executed using functions like exec() and CreateProcess(), the attacker might not be able to combine multiple commands together in the same line.\n\nFrom a weakness standpoint, these variants represent distinct programmer errors. In the first variant, the programmer clearly intends that input from untrusted parties will be part of the arguments in the command to be executed. In the second variant, the programmer does not intend for the command to be accessible to any untrusted party, but the programmer probably has not accounted for alternate ways in which malicious attackers can provide input.",
