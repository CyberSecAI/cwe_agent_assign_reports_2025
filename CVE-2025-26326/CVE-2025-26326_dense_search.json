  "query": "A vulnerability was identified in the NVDA Remote (version 2.6.4) and Tele NVDA Remote (version 2025.3.3) remote connection add-ons, which allows an attacker to obtain total control of the remote system by guessing a weak password. The problem occurs because these add-ons accept any password entered by the user and do not have an additional authentication or computer verification mechanism. Tests indicate that more than 1,000 systems use easy-to-guess passwords, many with less than 4 to 6 characters, including common sequences. This allows brute force attacks or trial-and-error attempts by malicious invaders. The vulnerability can be exploited by a remote attacker who knows or can guess the password used in the connection. As a result, the attacker gains complete access to the affected system and can execute commands, modify files, and compromise user security.",
