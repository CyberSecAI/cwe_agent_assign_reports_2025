  "description": "Shields.io is a service for concise, consistent, and legible badges in SVG and raster format. Shields.io and users self-hosting their own instance of shields using version < `server-2024-09-25` are vulnerable to a remote execution vulnerability via the **JSONPath library** used by the Dynamic JSON/Toml/Yaml badges. This vulnerability would allow any user with access to make a request to a URL on the instance to the ability to execute code by crafting a malicious JSONPath expression. All users who self-host an instance are vulnerable. This problem was fixed in server-2024-09-25. Those who follow the tagged releases should update to `server-2024-09-25` or later. Those who follow the rolling tag on DockerHub, `docker pull shieldsio/shieldsnext` to update to the latest version. As a workaround, blocking access to the endpoints `/badge/dynamic/json`, `/badge/dynamic/toml`, and `/badge/dynamic/yaml` (e.g via a firewall or reverse proxy in front of your instance) would prevent the exploitable endpoints from being accessed.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-47180:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n- The vulnerability stems from the usage of the `jsonpath` library in the Shields.io project's dynamic badge generation feature (JSON/TOML/YAML). The `jsonpath` library had a prototype pollution vulnerability that allowed attackers to inject malicious code via crafted JSONPath expressions.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The core vulnerability is that malicious JSONPath expressions could be crafted to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting Shields.io or a self-hosted instance.\n- **Prototype Pollution:** The underlying issue in the `jsonpath` library allows an attacker to manipulate object prototypes, which could lead to code execution or other unexpected behavior.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Complete Compromise:** An attacker could achieve remote code execution on the server, potentially leading to full control of the affected system.\n- **Data Exfiltration:** Attackers could potentially exfiltrate sensitive data accessible to the server, although the Shields.io instance itself is designed to minimize sensitive data.\n- **Disruption of Service:** Attackers could disrupt the service by causing it to crash or become unavailable.\n- **Token Exfiltration (for Shields.io users):** While the attack surface is limited, if attackers compromised the main Shields.io instance, they could potentially have exfiltrated read-only GitHub API tokens that users had donated to the platform to increase rate limits.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Malicious JSONPath Expressions:** The primary attack vector is through crafted JSONPath expressions in the URL parameters of requests to the dynamic JSON/TOML/YAML badge endpoints.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Network Access:** Attackers must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable dynamic badge endpoints.\n- **Understanding of JSONPath:** The attacker needs to understand how to craft malicious JSONPath expressions to exploit the vulnerability. This includes understanding how the prototype pollution vulnerability in the vulnerable library is exploitable.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- **Patch Information:** The vulnerability was addressed by switching to the `jsonpath-plus` library and disabling its script expression functionality (`eval: false`).\n- **Backwards Compatibility:** Switching to `jsonpath-plus` with `eval: false` disabled some query syntax previously supported by the old library, requiring users to rewrite some queries.  A detailed table of query syntax differences is provided to aid in migration.\n- **Self-Hosted Instances:** Self-hosted instances are particularly vulnerable and users were advised to upgrade immediately.\n- **Shields.io users:** Users of the main Shields.io instance were advised to revoke their donated GitHub tokens as a precaution.\n- **Endpoints:** The vulnerable endpoints are `/badge/dynamic/json`, `/badge/dynamic/toml`, and `/badge/dynamic/yaml`.\n\nThe provided content offers more context than the initial CVE description (which was a placeholder), including the details of the vulnerable library, the patch, and the impact on both self-hosted and hosted Shields.io users.",

Specifically, the selection of CWE-94 was influenced by its position as a Base level CWE related to code injection, which is more specific than the Class level CWE-74. Additionally, CWE-1336 which is related to template engine injection, also influenced the selection of CWE-94 as the root cause, as the JSONPath library can be viewed as a form of template engine.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n    cwe1336[\"CWE-1336: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n\n    cwe1336 -->|CHILDOF| cwe94\n    cwe94 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe94 primary\n    class cwe1336,cwe74 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper neutralization** of special elements in the JSONPath library, leading to **code injection** and ultimately resulting in **remote code execution**.\n\n*   **Root Cause:** **Improper Neutralization** of special elements in JSONPath expressions.\n*   **Weakness:** **Code Injection** due to the ability to control code generation.\n*   **Impact:** **Remote Code Execution** on the server.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial assessment strongly points to CWE-94 as the primary weakness, supported by the evidence of **code injection** via malicious JSONPath expressions. The vulnerability description and CVE reference summaries clearly indicate that the root cause is the ability to control code generation due to the **improper neutralization** of special elements.\n\nThe retriever results also support this, with CWE-94 being a high-ranking candidate. While other CWEs like CWE-918 (Server-Side Request Forgery) and CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) were considered, they do not accurately represent the core issue of code injection.\n\nThe final decision to assign CWE-94 is based on the evidence of **code injection**, its alignment with the CWE description, and its position in the vulnerability chain as the enabler of remote code execution. CWE-94 is at the optimal level of specificity, being a Base level CWE that directly addresses the **improper control of code generation**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product establishes a communication channel to (or from) an endpoint for privileged or protected operations, but it does not properly ensure that it is communicating with the correct endpoint.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
