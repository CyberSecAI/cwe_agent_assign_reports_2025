  "query": "An Uncontrolled Resource Consumption vulnerability in the http daemon (httpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series, QFX Series, MX Series and EX Series allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause Denial-of-Service (DoS). An attacker can send specific HTTPS connection requests to the device, triggering the creation of processes that are not properly terminated. Over time, this leads to resource exhaustion, ultimately causing the device to crash and restart. The following command can be used to monitor the resource usage user@host> show system processes extensive | match mgd | count This issue affects Junos OS on SRX Series and EX Series All versions before 21.4R3-S7, from 22.2 before 22.2R3-S4, from 22.3 before 22.3R3-S3, from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S2, from 23.2 before 23.2R2-S1, from 23.4 before 23.4R1-S2, 23.4R2.",
