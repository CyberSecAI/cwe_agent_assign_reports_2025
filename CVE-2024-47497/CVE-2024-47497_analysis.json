  "description": "An **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption** vulnerability in the http daemon (httpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series, QFX Series, MX Series and EX Series allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause Denial-of-Service (DoS). An attacker can send specific HTTPS connection requests to the device, triggering the creation of processes that are not properly terminated. Over time, this leads to resource exhaustion, ultimately causing the device to crash and restart. The following command can be used to monitor the resource usage user@host> show system processes extensive | match mgd | count This issue affects Junos OS on SRX Series and EX Series All versions before 21.4R3-S7, from 22.2 before 22.2R3-S4, from 22.3 before 22.3R3-S3, from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S2, from 23.2 before 23.2R2-S1, from 23.4 before 23.4R1-S2, 23.4R2.",

CWE-400 is a Class-level CWE, while CWE-770 is a Base-level CWE and a ChildOf CWE-400. The vulnerability involves allocating resources without limits, which directly aligns with CWE-770. However, since the description focuses on the consumption aspect, and the root cause is that processes are not properly terminated after specific HTTPS connection requests which leads to resource exhaustion, it is more appropriately mapped to CWE-400. CWE-770 can be considered as a contributing factor.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe400 primary\n    class cwe770 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the receipt of specific HTTPS connection requests. These requests trigger the creation of processes. The processes are **not properly terminated**, leading to **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption** (CWE-400) and ultimately causing a Denial-of-Service (DoS).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly suggests CWE-400, **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption**, due to the explicit mention of this weakness in the vulnerability description. The description clearly states that the system is vulnerable to resource exhaustion caused by processes that are not properly terminated due to specific HTTPS connection requests.\n\nSeveral CWEs were considered based on the Retriever Results. CWE-770, **Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling**, was considered because it is more specific than CWE-400, as it relates to the allocation of resources without imposing restrictions. However, the issue is not merely about the allocation but the **lack of proper termination** which leads to a sustained consumption of resources.\n\nCWE-401, **Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime**, was considered, but it is more specific to memory leaks, whereas this vulnerability involves a more general resource exhaustion scenario, and the processes are not properly terminated not just memory.\n\nCWE-789, **Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value**, was not selected because the vulnerability does not specifically involve allocating memory with excessive size values.\n\nCWE-252, **Unchecked Return Value**, was not selected as there is no evidence of unchecked return values contributing to the vulnerability.\n\nCWE-400, **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption**, is selected as the primary CWE because it accurately represents the **weakness** described in the vulnerability, where resources are consumed without proper control, leading to a denial-of-service. This aligns with the core issue of resource exhaustion.\n\nCWE-770, **Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling**, is a secondary CWE because the root cause relates to processes are not properly terminated after specific HTTPS connection requests, allocating resources without proper limits or throttling contributes to the uncontrolled resource consumption.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly address the root cause and contributing factors of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource, thereby enabling an actor to influence the amount of resources consumed, eventually leading to the exhaustion of available resources.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-400 is intended for incorrect behaviors in which the product is expected to track and restrict how many resources it consumes, but CWE-400 is often misused because it is conflated with the \"technical impact\" of vulnerabilities in which resource consumption occurs. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).\n\n\n\n## CWE-410: Insufficient Resource Pool\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product's resource pool is not large enough to handle peak demand, which allows an attacker to prevent others from accessing the resource by using a (relatively) large number of requests for resources.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates a reusable resource or group of resources on behalf of an actor without imposing any restrictions on the size or number of resources that can be allocated, in violation of the intended security policy for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-401: Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently track and release allocated memory after it has been used, which slowly consumes remaining memory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
