## Root Cause

*   A GET SQL injection vulnerability was found in multiple PHP files in the Tailoring Management System Project In PHP with Source Code project. The reason for this issue is that an attacker injects malicious code from the parameter "id" or "expid" or "incid" or "typeid" or "staffid" and uses it directly in SQL queries without proper sanitization or validation. This allows an attacker to forge input values to manipulate SQL queries and perform unauthorized actions.

## Impact

*   Attackers can exploit this SQL injection vulnerability to achieve unauthorized database access, sensitive data leakage, data tampering, comprehensive system control, and even service interruption, posing a serious threat to system security and business continuity.

## Attack Vectors

*   The vulnerability can be exploited by injecting malicious SQL queries through the "id", "expid", "incid", "typeid", or "staffid" parameters in the GET requests.

## Required attacker capabilities/position

*   The attacker needs the ability to craft malicious SQL queries and inject them through the vulnerable parameters.

## Mitigation or fix

1.  Use prepared statements and parameter binding:
    Preparing statements can prevent SQL injection as they separate SQL code from user input data. When using prepare statements, the value entered by the user is treated as pure data and will not be interpreted as SQL code.
2.  Input validation and filtering:
    Strictly validate and filter user input data to ensure it conforms to the expected format.
3.  Minimize database user permissions:
    Ensure that the account used to connect to the database has the minimum necessary permissions. Avoid using accounts with advanced permissions (such as' root 'or' admin ') for daily operations.
4.  Regular security audits:
    Regularly conduct code and system security audits to promptly identify and fix potential security vulnerabilities.
