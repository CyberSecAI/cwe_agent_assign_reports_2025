However, the document does not specify the technical details of the root cause of the vulnerability.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\\n- Remote Command Execution vulnerability.\\n\\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\\n- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute commands remotely on the affected system. The CVSS score indicates a high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.\\n\\n**Attack Vectors:**\\n- The attack vector is \"Network\" (AV:N), meaning the attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely over a network.\\n-  The attack complexity is low (AC:L), indicating that the attack does not require special conditions.\\n- No privileges are required (PR:N) for exploitation.\\n- No user interaction is required (UI:N).\\n\\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\\n- The attacker must have network connectivity to the vulnerable Avaya IP Office system.\\n- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.\\n\\n**Additional Details:**\\n- Affected versions include all Avaya IP Office versions prior to 11.1.3.1.\\n- The vulnerability is classified as \"Critical\" with a CVSS v3 base score of 10.\\n- The document also mentions a second related CVE-2024-4197 with a similar severity, but requiring low privileges for exploitation.\\n- Avaya recommends implementing firewalls, ACLs, and physical security as mitigation strategies while updating to version 11.1.3.1.', similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '',
