This **weakness** allows an attacker to perform a timing attack and retrieve the remote cluster token. The primary CWE is therefore CWE-208 (Observable Timing Discrepancy), as the timing difference in the comparison operation is observable and exploitable. This aligns with the description of CWE-208, which states: \"Two separate operations in a product require different amounts of time to complete, in a way that is observable to an actor and reveals security-relevant information about the state of the product.\"\n\nCWE-1254 (Incorrect Comparison Logic Granularity) could be considered as a secondary candidate since the comparison logic is not precise enough.
