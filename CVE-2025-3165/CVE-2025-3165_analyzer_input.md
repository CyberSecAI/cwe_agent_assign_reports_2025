# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-3165

## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability classified as critical has been found in thu-pacman chitu 0.1.0. This affects the function torch.load of the file chitu/chitu/backend.py. The manipulation of the argument ckpt_path/quant_ckpt_dir leads to **deserialization**. An attack has to be approached locally.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **deserialization**
- **product:** thu-pacman chitu
- **version:** 0.1.0
- **component:** torch.load of chitu/chitu/backend.py

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-3165 Content

This content **IS RELATED** to a vulnerability report, specifically regarding arbitrary code execution via untrusted file deserialization. It provides significantly more detail than a typical CVE description would.

Here's a breakdown of the extracted information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The `torch.load` function is used to load checkpoint files (.pt files) without the `weights_only=True` parameter. This causes the function to deserialize the entire file content, including potentially malicious Python objects and code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data.**  The application deserializes data from an untrusted source (.pt files) without proper safeguards.
*   Lack of input validation on the checkpoint files.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Arbitrary code execution on the system running the code.
*   Unauthorized access to sensitive data (user information, system configuration, model weights).
*   Model behavior modification.
*   Disruption of normal operations.
*   Potential system control.

**Attack vectors:**

*   An attacker provides a malicious `.pt` file (checkpoint file) crafted to contain malicious Python code.
*   The attacker ensures the vulnerable code loads this malicious file (e.g., by placing it in the expected directory and setting the correct arguments).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   Ability to create a malicious `.pt` file.
*   Ability to place the malicious file in a location accessible to the vulnerable code.
*   Potentially, the ability to influence the arguments passed to the loading function.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   Use `torch.load` with the `weights_only=True` parameter to only load the model weights and prevent the deserialization of arbitrary Python objects.
*   Implement input validation to verify the integrity and safety of the checkpoint files before loading them.

**Specific Code Locations:**

*   `chitu/chitu/backend.py` lines 319, 322, and 349.

**Affected Version:**

*   v0.1.0
