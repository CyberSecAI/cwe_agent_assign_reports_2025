The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section mentions \"LDAP Misconfiguration leading to command injection\" and the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section highlights the **weakness** as **command injection**. This aligns with CWE-78's description of **improper neutralization** of special elements used in an OS command.\n\nCWE-90, \"Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an LDAP Query ('LDAP Injection')\", was considered as a secondary CWE because the **command injection** occurs in the context of LDAP. However, the primary issue is still the **command injection** itself, making CWE-78 the more direct root cause.\n\nThe choice of CWE-78 over CWE-77 (its parent) is due to CWE-78 being more specific to OS commands, which is relevant in this case.
