  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-1115 Content\n\nBased on the provided content, this relates to a vulnerability report for RT-Thread Smart. The report details a potential information leak due to insufficient parameter validation in the syscall implementation.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nInsufficient validation of the `arg[0]` parameter (a `char *` pointer representing the thread name) in the `sys_thread_create` function within `rt-thread/components/lwp/lwp_syscall.c`.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **CWE-200: Information Leak:**  The lack of validation allows a malicious user thread to potentially pass a crafted pointer that references kernel memory.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nAn information leak, potentially allowing unauthorized access to sensitive kernel data.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\nA malicious user thread passing a crafted `char *` pointer as the `arg[0]` parameter to the `sys_thread_create` syscall.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\nThe attacker needs to be a user thread within the RT-Thread Smart environment.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\nThe report does not specify a mitigation or fix, but implies that proper validation of the `arg[0]` pointer is required to prevent the vulnerability.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\nThe content provides more detail than a typical CVE description, including the vulnerable code location and a specific code snippet. It also references the CWE identifier.",

Although CWE-200 is a Class-level CWE, there is not enough information to select a more specific Base or Variant level CWE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe200 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **insufficient validation** of the `arg[0]` parameter in the `sys_thread_create` function, leading directly to **information disclosure**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is **information disclosure** due to **insufficient validation** of the `arg[0]` parameter, which can lead to unauthorized access to kernel memory. The vulnerability description and CVE reference clearly point to this weakness. The retriever results also listed CWE-200 as the top candidate.\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).

Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates or initializes a resource such as a pointer, object, or variable using one type, but it later accesses that resource using a type that is incompatible with the original type.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of
