## Query
An Uncontrolled Resource Consumption vulnerability in the aftmand process of Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to consume memory resources, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS) condition. The processes do not recover on their own and must be manually restarted. This issue affects both IPv4 and IPv6. Changes in memory usage can be monitored using the following CLI command user@device> show system memory node | grep evo-aftmann This issue affects Junos OS Evolved * All versions before 21.2R3-S8-EVO, * 21.3 versions before 21.3R3-S5-EVO, * 21.4 versions before 21.4R3-S5-EVO, * 22.1 versions before 22.1R3-S4-EVO, * 22.2 versions before 22.2R3-S4-EVO, * 22.3 versions before 22.3R3-S3-EVO, * 22.4 versions before 22.4R2-S2-EVO, 22.4R3-EVO, * 23.2 versions before 23.2R1-S1-EVO, 23.2R2-EVO.
