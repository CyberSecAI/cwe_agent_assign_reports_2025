# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2025-22093
## Query
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drm/amd/display avoid NPD when ASIC does not support DMUB ctx->dmub_srv will de NULL if the ASIC does not support DMUB, which is tested in dm_dmub_sw_init. However, it will be dereferenced in dmub_hw_lock_mgr_cmd if should_use_dmub_lock returns true. This has been the case since dmub support has been added for PSR1. Fix this by checking for dmub_srv in should_use_dmub_lock. [ 37.440832]
