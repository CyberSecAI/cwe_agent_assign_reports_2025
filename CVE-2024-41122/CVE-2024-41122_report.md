# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-41122

## Description

Woodpecker is a simple yet powerful CI/CD engine with great extensibility. The server allow to create any user who can trigger a pipeline run malicious workflows 1. Those workflows can either lead to a host takeover that runs the agent executing the workflow. 2. Or allow to extract the secrets who would be normally provided to the plugins whos entrypoint are overwritten. This issue has been addressed in release version 2.7.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Impact:** ['host takeover', 'extract secrets']
- **Vector:** malicious workflows
- **Attacker:** any user who can trigger a pipeline run
- **Product:** Woodpecker CI/CD engine
- **Version:** before 2.7.0

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-88 | Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection') | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE - Root cause |
| CWE-78 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE - Impact |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is CWE-88, as the injection of arbitrary environment variables allows attackers to control command arguments. CWE-78 is a potential consequence if the injected arguments lead to OS command execution. The graph relationships confirm that CWE-88 can be related to CWE-78 via parent child relationships through CWE-74, and peer relationships. The base level of abstraction is chosen for both to accurately reflect the specific weaknesses.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **improper neutralization of argument delimiters** (CWE-88) when constructing commands with environment variables. This leads to potential **OS command injection** (CWE-78), ultimately resulting in host takeover and secret extraction.

## Summary of Analysis
The primary assessment is based on the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which provides detailed evidence of the vulnerability. The key evidence is the **unrestricted environment variable injection**, which enables attackers to **overwrite environment variables** and **bypass plugin entrypoints**. The retriever results and graph relationships support mapping CWE-88 as the primary cause and CWE-78 as a potential impact.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately reflect the nature of the vulnerability. CWE-88 captures the root cause, while CWE-78 describes a potential consequence.

**CWE Considerations:**

*   **CWE-88 Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection'):** This is the primary CWE because the vulnerability lies in the improper handling of argument delimiters when constructing commands with environment variables. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" states: "The core weakness is that Woodpecker CI allowed users to set arbitrary environment variables that were passed directly to plugin executions. This permitted the use of "dangerous" environment variables like `LD_PRELOAD` or `PATH` which influence how binaries and libraries are loaded and executed."
*   **CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection'):** This is a secondary CWE because it describes a potential impact of the vulnerability. If the injected arguments from CWE-88 are used in an OS command, it can lead to command injection. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" mentions the possibility of host takeover: "Attackers could potentially achieve host takeover on the machine running the agent that executes the vulnerable pipeline steps."

**CWEs Considered But Not Used:**

*   **CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal'):** While path traversal could be a consequence of improper neutralization, it is not the primary weakness in this case.
*   **CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection'):** This is a broader category of injection and is less specific than CWE-88.
*   **CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection'):** While code execution is a possible outcome, the root cause is related to argument injection rather than direct code injection.
*   **CWE-285 Improper Authorization:** The issue is not directly related to authorization, but rather to the injection of arguments.
