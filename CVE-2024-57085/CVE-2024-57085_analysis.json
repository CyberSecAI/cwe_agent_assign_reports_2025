CWE-1321 is a variant of a weakness related to improper control of object properties, while CWE-400 is a class of weaknesses resulting in uncontrolled resource consumption. The abstraction levels influenced the decision to select the more specific CWE-1321 as the primary cause.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1321[\"CWE-1321: Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion')\"]\n    \n    cwe1321 -->|CAN_CAUSE| cwe400\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1321 primary\n    class cwe400 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **prototype pollution** (CWE-1321) in the `deepMerge` function. This **rootcause** leads to a Denial of Service (DoS), which is a form of uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400). The attacker crafts a payload that exploits the **prototype pollution**, leading to the DoS impact.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-1321 as the primary weakness due to the explicit mention of \"**prototype pollution**\" in the vulnerability description and the CVE reference summary. The description states, \"A **prototype pollution** in the function deepMerge of @stryker-mutator/util v8.6.0 allows attackers to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) via supplying a crafted payload.\" The CVE reference summary further confirms this by stating, \"The vulnerability is due to the use of `lib.deepMerge` function without proper sanitization of input, allowing an attacker to inject properties into the `Object.prototype`.\"\n\nThe graph relationships further influenced the selection by highlighting the connection between CWE-1321 and CWE-400. The evidence supports selecting CWE-1321 as the **rootcause**, with the DoS being the resulting impact (CWE-400).\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-1321 directly addresses the **prototype pollution** issue, while CWE-400 captures the resulting impact of resource consumption due to the DoS.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1321: Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component that specifies attributes that are to be initialized or updated in an object, but it does not properly control modifications of attributes of the object prototype.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
