# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-57085

## Vulnerability Description
A **prototype pollution** in the function deepMerge of @stryker-mutator/util v8.6.0 allows attackers to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) via supplying a crafted payload.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **prototype pollution**
- **impact:** Denial of Service (DoS)
- **vector:** crafted payload
- **attacker:** attackers
- **product:** @stryker-mutator/util
- **version:** v8.6.0
- **component:** deepMerge function

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability is due to the use of `lib.deepMerge` function without proper sanitization of input, allowing an attacker to inject properties into the `Object.prototype`.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
Prototype Pollution

Impact of exploitation:
Denial of Service (DoS) at a minimum. Potential for injection-based attacks and arbitrary command execution if the polluted prototype is used in sensitive Node.js APIs.

Attack vectors:
Supply a payload with `Object.prototype` setter to the `lib.deepMerge` function.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
An attacker needs to be able to control the input to the `lib.deepMerge` function.

Mitigation or fix:
The advisory does not specify a fix, but suggests avoiding the use of the vulnerable function or sanitizing the input to prevent prototype pollution.
