## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Impact:** Information disclosure
- **Vector:** implicit broadcast

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-200 | Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor | 0.9 | Class | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-927 | Use of Implicit Intent for Sensitive Communication | 0.7 | Variant | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship identified is that CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) is a broad class, and CWE-927 (Use of Implicit Intent for Sensitive Communication) is a variant of this class, providing a more specific context related to Android applications. The selection of CWE-200 as the primary CWE and CWE-927 as a secondary candidate reflects this hierarchical structure. The graph relationships did not greatly influence the decision here as the vulnerability description does not provide enough information to make a specific determination of rootcause.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain begins with sending an implicit broadcast containing app launch information, leading to the **impact** of information disclosure.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause and impact of the vulnerability. The vulnerability description states "Information disclosure while sending implicit broadcast containing APP launch information." This directly points to CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) as the primary issue, since the fundamental problem is that sensitive information is being exposed. The "implicit broadcast" part of the description leads to considering CWE-927 (Use of Implicit Intent for Sensitive Communication) as a secondary, more specific issue.

The decision to prioritize CWE-200 is based on its direct relevance to the **impact** described. However, the implicit broadcast mechanism suggests a more granular weakness related to how the information is being sent, thus the inclusion of CWE-927. The abstraction levels were considered, and while a more specific CWE would be ideal, the available information only strongly supports the class-level CWE-200 with the variant CWE-927.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-927: Use of Implicit Intent for Sensitive Communication
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The Android application uses an implicit intent for transmitting sensitive data to other applications.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-941: Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product creates a communication channel to initiate an outgoing request to an actor, but it does not correctly specify the intended destination for that actor.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-213: Exposure of Sensitive Information Due to Incompatible Policies
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product's intended functionality exposes information to certain actors in accordance with the developer's security policy, but this information is regarded as sensitive according to the intended security policies of other stakeholders such as the product's administrator, users, or others whose information is being processed.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-223: Omission of Security-relevant Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not record or display information that would be important for identifying the source or nature of an attack, or determining if an action is safe.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-1295: Debug Messages Revealing Unnecessary Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product fails to adequately prevent the revealing of unnecessary and potentially sensitive system information within debugging messages.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-925: Improper Verification of Intent by Broadcast Receiver
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.67
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The Android application uses a Broadcast Receiver that receives an Intent but does not properly verify that the Intent came from an authorized source.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.67
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-359: Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.66
