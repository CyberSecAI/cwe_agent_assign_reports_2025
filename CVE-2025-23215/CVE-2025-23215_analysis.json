  "description": "PMD is an extensible multilanguage static code analyzer. The passphrase for the PMD and PMD Designer release signing keys are included in jar published to Maven Central. The private key itself is not known to have been compromised itself, but given its passphrase is, it must also be considered potentially compromised. As a mitigation, both compromised keys have been revoked so that no future use of the keys are possible. Note, that the published artifacts in Maven Central under the group id net.sourceforge.pmd are not compromised and the signatures are valid.",

The following keys were compromised:\n  - `94A5 2756 9CAF 7A47 AFCA BDE4 86D3 7ECA 8C2E 4C5B`: PMD Designer (Release Signing Key)\n  - `EBB2 41A5 45CB 17C8 7FAC B2EB D0BF 1D73 7C9A 1C22`: PMD Release Signing Key\n- Mitigation or fix:\n  - Revoked the compromised keys.\n  - Reworked the build script to prevent inclusion of sensitive information.\n  - A new release signing key was implemented: `2EFA 55D0 785C 31F9 56F2 F87E A0B5 CA1A 4E08 6838`\n```",

This relates to how the passphrase was stored, leading to the compromise. **CWE-327 Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm**, a Class level CWE, is related because the use of a **weak passphrase** weakens the cryptographic protection, but is not the root cause. **CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor**, a Class level CWE, is related to the disclosure of the passphrase.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe256[\"CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\"]\n    cwe327[\"CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n\n    cwe327 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe200\n    cwe256 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe327\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe256 primary\n    class cwe327,cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **CWE-256 Plaintext Storage of a Password**, as the **weak passphrase** was included in a jar. This leads to **CWE-327 Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm** due to the **weak passphrase** compromising the cryptographic key. Finally, this results in **CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor**, as the passphrase was exposed.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The key evidence is the **rootcause: weak passphrase** in the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" and \"The passphrase for the PMD and PMD Designer release signing keys are included in jar published to Maven Central\" from the vulnerability description. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" also indicates \"Root cause of vulnerability: The passphrase for a GPG key was included in a JAR file published to Maven Central.\" These statements point towards **CWE-256 Plaintext Storage of a Password** as the primary weakness.\n\nThe retriever results suggested **CWE-327 Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm** and **CWE-201 Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data**, but these are consequences of the initial weakness. The relationship graph shows how **CWE-256 Plaintext Storage of a Password** can precede **CWE-327 Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm** and **CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor**, reinforcing the chain of events.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. **CWE-256 Plaintext Storage of a Password** accurately represents the coding error, while **CWE-327 Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm** and **CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor** describes the consequences.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*   **CWE-1391** was not chosen as it is more generic and the **weak passphrase** was directly included in the jar file.\n\n## CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not verify, or incorrectly verifies, the cryptographic signature for data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*   **CWE-347** was not chosen as the description indicates that the signatures were valid.\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
