This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of PDF-XChange Editor. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of PDF files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated object.

    "enhanced_query": "# Vulnerability Description\n\n    PDF-XChange Editor PDF File Parsing Out-Of-Bounds Read **Information Disclosure Vulnerability**. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of PDF-XChange Editor. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of PDF files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated object. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.
