During the login process, user credentials are sent in plain text between the device and the user's source device.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- Weak encoding for password transmission, specifically using plain text.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\nAn attacker can potentially intercept and steal user credentials, which could lead to unauthorized access to the system.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- The attack vector is adjacent. An attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the device to intercept the credentials.\n- The user needs to be tricked into initiating a login while the attacker is listening on the network.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- The attacker needs to be positioned on the same network segment as the device.\n- The attacker needs to monitor network traffic to capture the plain text credentials.\n- User interaction is required (UI:P - user interaction is needed)",

CWE-319 is a child of CWE-311 (Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data). CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials) is a Class-level CWE and a parent of CWE-523 (Unprotected Transport of Credentials) and CWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password). Selecting CWE-319 gives a better description of the vulnerability because the credentials are being transmitted in cleartext.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe311[\"CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    cwe523[\"CWE-523: Unprotected Transport of Credentials\"]\n    cwe256[\"CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\"]\n    \n    cwe319 -->|CHILDOF| cwe311\n    cwe523 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    cwe256 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe319 primary\n    class cwe522 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **sharing of user credentials in plain text** during the login process, which leads to the **transmission of sensitive information in cleartext**. This can then be exploited by an attacker to intercept and steal user credentials, leading to unauthorized access.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability is due to the **sharing of user credentials in plain text** between the device and the user's source device during the login process. This directly corresponds to **Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information**, as the credentials are sent without encryption. The vulnerability description key phrases mention \"**shares user credentials plain text between the device and the user source device**\", which clearly indicates the root cause. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also states that \"user credentials are sent in plain text between the device and the user's source device.\"\n\nI considered CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials), but it is a more general class of weakness. The specific issue is the transmission of credentials in cleartext, which is more accurately described by CWE-319.\n\nThe retriever results identified CWE-522 as a top result, but CWE-319 is a more precise description of the vulnerability. The evidence strongly supports CWE-319 as the primary CWE.\n\n# Relevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nStoring a password in plaintext may result in a system compromise.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
