It details a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in the \"tarzan-cms\" project hosted on Gitee. The information provided goes into more detail than a typical CVE description would initially offer.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the extracted information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe system lacks content restrictions on zip files uploaded by users. Specifically, when uploading a theme package, the system doesn't validate the contents of the zip archive.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The application allows users to upload zip files without proper validation.\n*   **YAML Deserialization Vulnerability:** A specially crafted `theme.yaml` file within the uploaded zip archive can be exploited to achieve remote code execution. This suggests a vulnerability in how the application processes YAML files.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n1.  Navigate to the \"Add Theme\" functionality.\n2.  Select the \"Click to Select Theme Package\" button.\n3.  Upload a malicious zip archive containing a crafted `theme.yaml` file.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   An attacker needs to be able to upload files to the system (potentially requiring a user account, though the content doesn't explicitly state this).\n*   The attacker needs knowledge of YAML syntax and the ability to craft a malicious payload.\n*   The attacker needs access to a YAML payload generator (e.g., `https://github.com/artsploit/yaml-payload`).\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\nThe content doesn't explicitly state a fix, but the implied mitigation is to:\n\n*   Implement strict content validation for uploaded zip files.\n*   Sanitize or restrict the processing of YAML files to prevent deserialization of malicious payloads.\n*   Implement a whitelist approach for allowed file types and content within uploaded archives.\n\n**POC (Proof of Concept):**\n\n1.  Create a YAML file named `theme.yaml`.\n2.  Write a malicious YAML payload into the file.\n3.  Zip the `theme.yaml` file as `theme.zip`.\n4.  Upload the `theme.zip` file through the \"Add Theme\" functionality.\n\nThe content also includes screenshots illustrating the attack process and the relevant code paths (\"Transmission Path\" and \"sink\").",

CWE-434 is a secondary weakness that allows the upload of a malicious file, which then leads to the **deserialization** vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe502[\"CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data\"]\n    cwe434[\"CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\"]\n\n    cwe434 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe502\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe502 primary\n    class cwe434 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with CWE-434, where a malicious file is uploaded. This leads to CWE-502, where the untrusted data is deserialized, leading to remote code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe vulnerability involves a **deserialization** issue due to **unrestricted file upload**. The primary weakness is CWE-502, as it represents the core issue of **deserializing** untrusted data, leading to code execution. The secondary weakness is CWE-434, as it enables the upload of a malicious file that triggers the **deserialization** process. This assessment is based on the provided evidence, particularly the analysis of CVE-2025-1113, which explicitly mentions the lack of content restrictions on uploaded zip files and the exploitation of a crafted `theme.yaml` file for remote code execution. The graph relationships confirm that the file upload precedes the deserialization.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1336: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a template engine to insert or process externally-influenced input, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements or syntax that can be interpreted as template expressions or other code directives when processed by the engine.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
