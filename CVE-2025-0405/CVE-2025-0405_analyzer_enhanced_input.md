## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-0405 based on provided content

The provided content details a SQL injection vulnerability in the `gymxmjpa` project on GitHub.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The `count` method in `src/main/java/com/liujian/gymxmjpa/controller/GoodsController.java` does not filter the `goodsName` parameter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   SQL Injection

**Impact of exploitation:**

The vulnerability allows for blind SQL injection, potentially leading to database information disclosure and potentially modification or deletion of data. The provided examples demonstrate the ability to determine the database name ("gym") and its length.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is exploitable via HTTP requests to the `/goods/count` endpoint, manipulating the `goodsName` parameter with malicious SQL code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint. No authentication is mentioned, suggesting it may be publicly accessible.
*   Knowledge of SQL injection techniques is required to craft the malicious payload.

**Mitigation or fix:**

The content does not provide a specific fix, but implies that proper input validation and sanitization of the `goodsName` parameter in the `count` method is necessary to prevent SQL injection.  Parameterized queries or prepared statements should be used.

**Note:** This content provides more detail than a typical CVE description, including specific examples of exploitation attempts and the database name.
