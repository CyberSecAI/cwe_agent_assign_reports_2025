  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-0405 based on provided content\n\nThe provided content details a SQL injection vulnerability in the `gymxmjpa` project on GitHub.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe `count` method in `src/main/java/com/liujian/gymxmjpa/controller/GoodsController.java` does not filter the `goodsName` parameter.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   SQL Injection\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nThe vulnerability allows for blind SQL injection, potentially leading to database information disclosure and potentially modification or deletion of data. The provided examples demonstrate the ability to determine the database name (\"gym\") and its length.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   The vulnerability is exploitable via HTTP requests to the `/goods/count` endpoint, manipulating the `goodsName` parameter with malicious SQL code.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint. No authentication is mentioned, suggesting it may be publicly accessible.\n*   Knowledge of SQL injection techniques is required to craft the malicious payload.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\nThe content does not provide a specific fix, but implies that proper input validation and sanitization of the `goodsName` parameter in the `count` method is necessary to prevent SQL injection.  Parameterized queries or prepared statements should be used.\n\n**Note:** This content provides more detail than a typical CVE description, including specific examples of exploitation attempts and the database name.",

The vulnerability description clearly states a SQL Injection vulnerability due to the manipulation of the `goodsName` argument, which directly aligns with CWE-89's description of improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL command. Other CWEs considered were related to general injection or improper neutralization, but CWE-89 was the most specific and accurate.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe89 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain consists of a single step:\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** CWE-89 - Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') due to the lack of input validation/sanitization of the `goodsName` parameter.\n    - This directly leads to the vulnerability.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, which clearly indicates a SQL injection vulnerability. The \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" explicitly mentions \"**sql injection**\" as the weakness and \"manipulation of goodsName argument\" as the vector. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms that the `count` method in `src/main/java/com/liujian/gymxmjpa/controller/GoodsController.java` does not filter the `goodsName` parameter, leading to SQL injection.\n\nThe retriever results also strongly support CWE-89, with a score of 1.0. The CWE description perfectly matches the vulnerability: \"The product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command.\"\n\nThe graph relationships did not significantly influence the decision, as the evidence directly points to CWE-89. The selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity (Base), as it accurately represents the root cause of the vulnerability.
