While it would be preferable to have a Base or Variant level CWE, there isn't enough information provided in the vulnerability description to pinpoint a more specific cause. CWE-863 is at the Class level, and the Retriever suggests that there might be more specific Base-level children. The other CWEs, such as CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) and CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor), while relevant, are not as directly related to the described **improper validation** leading to unauthorized actions.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    \n    cwe863 -->|PEEROF| cwe200\n    cwe863 -->|PEEROF| cwe20\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe200,cwe20 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with **improper validation of synced posts**. This **root cause** leads to **incorrect authorization**, which allows a malicious remote attacker to create, update, and delete arbitrary posts in arbitrary channels.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified the **improper validation of synced posts** as the **root cause**. Given this information and the ability of a malicious remote attacker to perform unauthorized actions, CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) was selected as the primary CWE.\n\nThe selection is heavily based on the vulnerability description's key phrases, particularly the \"**improper validation of synced posts**\" and the resulting \"create/update/delete arbitrary posts in arbitrary channels\".
