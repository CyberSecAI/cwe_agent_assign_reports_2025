  "query": "A vulnerability classified as problematic has been found in GNU Binutils 2.43. This affects the function _bfd_elf_write_section_eh_frame of the file bfd/elf-eh-frame.c of the component ld. The manipulation leads to memory corruption. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitability is told to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue.",
