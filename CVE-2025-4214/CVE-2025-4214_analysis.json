  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-4214 Content\n\nThe provided content details a SQL injection vulnerability in the \"Phpgurukul Online DJ Booking Management System V1.0\". This **relates** to a potential CVE, but it's important to note this is a report *about* a vulnerability, not the official CVE description itself. It provides significantly more detail than a typical CVE description would.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the extracted information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\n*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient user input validation of the 'fromdate' parameter in the `/admin/booking-bwdates-reports-details.php` file.  Malicious code injected into this parameter is directly used in SQL queries without proper cleaning or validation.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   SQL Injection\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   Unauthorized database access\n*   Sensitive data leakage\n*   Data tampering\n*   Comprehensive system control\n*   Service interruption\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   The `/admin/booking-bwdates-reports-details.php` file is vulnerable via the 'fromdate' POST parameter.\n*   No login or authorization is required to exploit the vulnerability.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   An attacker needs to be able to send a POST request to the vulnerable file with a crafted 'fromdate' parameter. No authentication is required.\n*   Knowledge of SQL injection techniques is necessary.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   **Use prepared statements and parameter binding:** This separates SQL code from user input.\n*   **Input validation and filtering:**  Strictly validate and filter user input.\n*   **Minimize database user permissions:** Use accounts with the least necessary privileges.\n*   **Regular security audits:** Conduct regular code and system security audits.\n\n**Payload Example:**\n\n```\nParameter: fromdate (POST)\n    Type: time-based blind\n    Title: MySQL >= 5.0.12 AND time-based blind (query SLEEP)\n    Payload: fromdate=1' AND (SELECT 4016 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))uvcB) AND 'KUwg'='KUwg&tomdate=1\n```\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n*   **Affected Product:** Online DJ Booking Management System\n*   **Vendor Homepage:** [https://phpgurukul.com/online-dj-booking-management-system-using-php-and-mysql/](https://phpgurukul.com/online-dj-booking-management-system-using-php-and-mysql/)\n*   **Vulnerable File:** `/admin/booking-bwdates-reports-details.php`\n*   **Version:** V1.0\n*   **Software Link:** [https://phpgurukul.com/?sdm_process_download=1&download_id=11402](https://phpgurukul.com/?sdm_process_download=1&download_id=11402)\n*   The report includes screenshots of `sqlmap` output demonstrating the vulnerability.",

The **weakness** is **SQL Injection** due to **improper neutralization** of special elements in an SQL command. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary identified CWE is CWE-89 which is a Base level CWE. No other CWEs are needed.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe89 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of root cause and weaknesses that followed for the Vulnerability Description:\n1.  The **root cause** is **improper neutralization** of input within the `fromdate` parameter.\n2.  The resulting **weakness** is **SQL Injection**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis indicates a clear case of SQL Injection (CWE-89) due to **improper neutralization** of the `fromdate` parameter. The evidence supporting this is strong, with the vulnerability description explicitly mentioning **SQL injection** and the CVE reference links confirming the presence of SQL Injection in the `fromdate` parameter, which is directly used in SQL queries without proper input validation.\n\nThe retriever results also strongly support CWE-89 as the primary weakness, with a score of 1.0.\n\nThe selection of CWE-89 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly addresses the **root cause** of the vulnerability. Other CWEs were considered, but were not used because they describe impacts or related weaknesses rather than the root cause.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.
