The Apttus_DocuApi__DocusignAuthentication__mdt object is installed via the marketplace from this package and stores some configuration information in a manner that could be compromised.

These disclosed components can be combined to create a valid session via the Docusign API. This will generally lead to a complete compromise of the Docusign account because the session is for an administrator service account and may have permission to re-authenticate as specific users with the same authorization flow.",
