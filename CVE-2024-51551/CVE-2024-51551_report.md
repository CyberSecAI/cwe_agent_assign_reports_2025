## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **use of default credentials** (CWE-1392 [CWE-1392: Use of Default Credentials]), which leads to unauthorized **access to the product**.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis focused on identifying the **root cause** of the vulnerability, which is the **use of default credentials**. The vulnerability description explicitly states that the vulnerability involves **default credentials**, which directly maps to CWE-1392 [CWE-1392: Use of Default Credentials]. The other CWEs considered were either too general or related to the impact of the vulnerability rather than the **root cause**. CWE-1392 [CWE-1392: Use of Default Credentials] is the most specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability.
