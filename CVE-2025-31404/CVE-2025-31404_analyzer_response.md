# Raw Analyzer Response for CVE-2025-31404

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-352 | Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) | 0.9 | Compound | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-79 | Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') | 0.8 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is identified as CWE-352 [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)], which is a compound weakness. The vulnerability description clearly states that a CSRF vulnerability exists. The impact of this vulnerability allows for Stored XSS, thus CWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')] is also present as a secondary weakness, because successful CSRF can lead to stored XSS.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** vulnerability (CWE-352), which allows an attacker to force a user to perform unwanted actions. This leads to the injection of malicious input, which is then stored and executed as **Cross-site Scripting (XSS)** (CWE-79) due to **improper neutralization of input**.
  - Root Cause: CWE-352 [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)]
  - Weakness: CWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')]

## Summary of Analysis
The primary vulnerability is clearly a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), as explicitly stated in the vulnerability description and CVE reference summary: "**rootcause: cross-site request forgery**" and "**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The AF Tell a Friend plugin is vulnerable to CSRF**". The **CSRF** vulnerability enables a malicious actor to force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions, in this case leading to Stored XSS. Thus the secondary vulnerability is the improper neutralization of input (CWE-79) leading to stored XSS.

The relationship graph shows that a successful CSRF attack can lead to Cross-Site Scripting.

The chosen CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly represent the **rootcause** (CSRF) and the resulting weakness (XSS) due to improper neutralization of input.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as "<", ">", and "&" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected:* This is a variant of XSS, but CWE-79 is a more general case and fits better given the description.

## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected:* This CWE is not directly supported by the description. There is no mention of immutable web parameters.

## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected:* This CWE is about authorization, which is not the primary issue. The issue is CSRF, where a legitimate user is tricked into performing actions.

## CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web server receives a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected:* This CWE is about SSRF. The issue is CSRF.

## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
**Abstraction Level**: Compound
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.

*Selected:* The vulnerability description and CVE summary explicitly mention CSRF.

## CWE-346: Origin Validation Error
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly verify that the source of data or communication is valid.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

*Not Selected:* This CWE is too generic. CSRF is more specific.

## CWE-790: Improper Filtering of Special Elements
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives data from an upstream component, but does not filter or incorrectly filters special elements before sending it to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

*Not Selected:* This CWE is related to filtering, but the vulnerability description states that the issue is CSRF leading to Stored XSS.

## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

*Not Selected:* This CWE is related to encoding/escaping. The vulnerability description doesn't mention encoding or escaping.

## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Selected:* The successful CSRF leads to Stored XSS because the input is not neutralized before it is placed in the output.

## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- R
