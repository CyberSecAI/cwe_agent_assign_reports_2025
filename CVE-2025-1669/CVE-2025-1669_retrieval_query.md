# Retrieval Query for CVE-2025-1669

# Vulnerability Description

    The School Management System WPSchoolPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the addNotify action in all versions up to, and including, 2.2.16 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and **lack of sufficient preparation** on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with teacher-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.
