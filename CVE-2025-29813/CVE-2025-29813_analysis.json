There are no direct parent-child or chain relationships that significantly influenced the selection in this case, as the vulnerability description aligns well with the definition of CWE-302.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe302[\"CWE-302: Authentication Bypass by Assumed-Immutable Data\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    \n    class cwe302 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain consists of a single step:\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** CWE-302 (Authentication Bypass by Assumed-Immutable Data) - The system incorrectly assumes that certain data elements used for authentication are immutable, allowing an attacker to modify them and bypass authentication.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe analysis is based heavily on the vulnerability description, which explicitly states \"Authentication Bypass by Assumed-Immutable Data\". The Retriever Results also list CWE-302 as the top candidate with a reasonable score.\nThe vulnerability description clearly indicates that the authentication bypass occurs because the system trusts data that should not be trusted, enabling an attacker to elevate privileges. This is a direct match to CWE-302. The fact that the vulnerability description calls out the term \"Authentication Bypass by Assumed-Immutable Data\" is strong evidence.\n\n# Relevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-302: Authentication Bypass by Assumed-Immutable Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe authentication scheme or implementation uses key data elements that are assumed to be immutable, but can be controlled or modified by the attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
