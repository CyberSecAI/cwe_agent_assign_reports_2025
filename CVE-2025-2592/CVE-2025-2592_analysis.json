  "description": "A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, has been found in Open Asset Import Library Assimp 5.4.3. This issue affects the function CSMImporterInternReadFile of the file code/AssetLib/CSM/CSMLoader.cpp. The manipulation leads to **heap-based buffer overflow**. The attack may be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The patch is named 2690e354da0c681db000cfd892a55226788f2743. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue.",

  "reference_content": "## CVE-2025-2592 Analysis (PLACEHOLDER)\n\nThe provided content details a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the Assimp library, specifically within the `Assimp::CSMImporter::InternReadFile` function when processing CSM (CityscapeML) files.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from a lack of bounds checking when copying data into a fixed-size buffer (`nda->mNodeName.data`) within the `InternReadFile` function. The `while` loop continues copying characters from the input buffer (`buffer`) until a space or newline is encountered, without verifying that the destination buffer has sufficient space.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **Heap-based Buffer Overflow (CWE-122):**  The core vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow.\n*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The code fails to validate the length of the input data before copying it into a fixed-size buffer.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nSuccessful exploitation could lead to remote code execution if an attacker can craft a malicious CSM file that triggers the overflow.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   **Malicious CSM File:** An attacker could create a specially crafted CSM file designed to trigger the buffer overflow when processed by a vulnerable version of Assimp.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious CSM file to a system running a vulnerable version of Assimp. This could be through a file upload, a network share, or other means of file delivery.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\nThe provided content indicates the vulnerability was fixed in commit `2690e35` by adding a check `&& buffer != end` to the `while` loop condition, preventing the write beyond the buffer's bounds.  The fix ensures the loop terminates when the end of the input buffer is reached, even if a space or newline hasn't been encountered.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n*   The vulnerability was discovered through fuzzing.\n*   Affected versions: assimp >= 5.4.3\n*   The fix is included in the assimp 6.0 release.\n*   The issue was closed by pull request #6052.\n\nThis content provides significantly more detail than a typical CVE description, including the specific code location, the root cause, a PoC, and details about the fix.",

CWE-122 is a variant of CWE-119, providing a more specific classification for the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe122[\"CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    \n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe122 primary\n    class cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of bounds checking** on the input data, leading to a **heap-based buffer overflow**, and potentially remote code execution. The chain can be represented as:\nLack of Input Validation -> CWE-122 -> Remote Code Execution\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis strongly suggests CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) as the primary CWE for this vulnerability. The vulnerability description explicitly states that the issue is a \"heap-based buffer overflow,\" and the CVE reference link content summary confirms this, highlighting the **lack of bounds checking** as the root cause. This directly aligns with the definition of CWE-122. The retriever results also list CWE-122 as a relevant candidate. CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) was considered but is a more general classification.
