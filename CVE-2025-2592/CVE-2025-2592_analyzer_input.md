- **component:** CSMImporterInternReadFile

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## CVE-2025-2592 Analysis (PLACEHOLDER)

The provided content details a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the Assimp library, specifically within the `Assimp::CSMImporter::InternReadFile` function when processing CSM (CityscapeML) files.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of bounds checking when copying data into a fixed-size buffer (`nda->mNodeName.data`) within the `InternReadFile` function. The `while` loop continues copying characters from the input buffer (`buffer`) until a space or newline is encountered, without verifying that the destination buffer has sufficient space.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Heap-based Buffer Overflow (CWE-122):**  The core vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The code fails to validate the length of the input data before copying it into a fixed-size buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**

Successful exploitation could lead to remote code execution if an attacker can craft a malicious CSM file that triggers the overflow.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Malicious CSM File:** An attacker could create a specially crafted CSM file designed to trigger the buffer overflow when processed by a vulnerable version of Assimp.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious CSM file to a system running a vulnerable version of Assimp. This could be through a file upload, a network share, or other means of file delivery.

**Mitigation or fix:**

The provided content indicates the vulnerability was fixed in commit `2690e35` by adding a check `&& buffer != end` to the `while` loop condition, preventing the write beyond the buffer's bounds.  The fix ensures the loop terminates when the end of the input buffer is reached, even if a space or newline hasn't been encountered.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered through fuzzing.
*   Affected versions: assimp >= 5.4.3
*   The fix is included in the assimp 6.0 release.
*   The issue was closed by pull request #6052.

This content provides significantly more detail than a typical CVE description, including the specific code location, the root cause, a PoC, and details about the fix.
