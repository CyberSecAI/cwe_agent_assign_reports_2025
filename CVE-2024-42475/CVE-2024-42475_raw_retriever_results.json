These can be successfully guessed by an attacker allowing them to perform a CSRF vs a user, associating the users session with the attackers protected resources. While `state` isnt exactly a cryptographic value, it should be generated in a cryptographically secure way. `generateState` should be using a CSPRNG. Version 0.11 modifies the `generateState` function to generate `state` values of at least 128 bits of entropy while using a CSPRNG.",
