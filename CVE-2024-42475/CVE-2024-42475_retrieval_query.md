# Retrieval Query for CVE-2024-42475

## Vulnerability Description
In the OAuth library for nim prior to version 0.11, the `state` values generated by the `generateState` function do not have sufficient entropy. These can be successfully guessed by an attacker allowing them to perform a CSRF vs a user, associating the users session with the attackers protected resources. While `state` isnt exactly a cryptographic value, it should be generated in a cryptographically secure way. `generateState` should be using a CSPRNG. Version 0.11 modifies the `generateState` function to generate `state` values of at least 128 bits of entropy while using a CSPRNG.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **the state values generated by the generateState function do not have sufficient entropy**
- **impact:** CSRF
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** nim
- **version:** prior to version 0.11
- **component:** OAuth library

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The `generateState` function in the `oauth2.nim` file generates state values with insufficient entropy. It uses a regular pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) instead of a cryptographically secure one (CSPRNG), and the generated state has only 18.57 bits of entropy, which is significantly less than the recommended 128 bits for secrets.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Inadequate entropy:** The generated `state` values have low entropy due to the limited range of characters and the short length, making them predictable.
*   **Use of non-CSPRNG:** The `rand` function from Nim's `std/random` module is used, which is explicitly stated to be unsuitable for cryptographic purposes.
*   **CWE-330 (Use of Insufficiently Random Values):** This vulnerability is classified under CWE-330 as the state generation doesn't produce sufficiently random values.
*   **CWE-352 (Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)):** The low entropy of the state value makes it guessable by an attacker which can lead to a CSRF attack.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **CSRF attacks:** An attacker can guess the state values and perform a CSRF attack against a user. This allows the attacker to associate the victim's session with the attacker's protected resources, potentially granting unauthorized access.
*   **Compromise of authorization flow:** By successfully guessing the state value an attacker can manipulate the OAuth2 authorization flow, potentially leading to various malicious outcomes.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The attack is network-based and does not require physical access.
*   **Prediction:** Attackers would need to be able to predict the state value which due to low entropy is feasible.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the application over the network.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerable system:** They need to know that the system uses the vulnerable `generateState` function.
*   **Ability to predict the state value:** They need to have the ability to guess a valid state due to low entropy.

**Additional notes:**

*   The code snippet from `oauth2.nim` shows the flawed `generateState` function:
    ```nim
    proc generateState*(): string =
        ## Generate a state.
        var r = 0
        result = ""
        randomize()
        for i in 0..4:
            r = rand(25)
            result = result & chr(97 + r)
    ```
*   The advisory references RFC6819, section 5.1.4.2.2, which recommends using a CSPRNG and generating secrets with at least 128 bits of entropy.
*   The vulnerability has a severity rating of **Moderate** with a CVSS score of 6.5
*   The fix recommendation is to modify the `generateState` function to use a CSPRNG and generate state values with at least 128 bits of entropy.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-335: Incorrect Usage of Seeds in Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses a Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) but does not correctly manage seeds.

### Extended Description


 PRNGs are deterministic and, while their output appears random, they cannot actually create entropy. They rely on cryptographically secure and unique seeds for entropy so proper seeding is critical to the secure operation of the PRNG.


 Management of seeds could be broken down into two main areas: 


  -  (1) protecting seeds as cryptographic material (such as a cryptographic key); 

  -  (2) whenever possible, using a uniquely generated seed from a cryptographically secure source 

 PRNGs require a seed as input to generate a stream of numbers that are functionally indistinguishable from random numbers. While the output is, in many cases, sufficient for cryptographic uses, the output of any PRNG is directly determined by the seed provided as input. If the seed can be ascertained by a third party, the entire output of the PRNG can be made known to them. As such, the seed should be kept secret and should ideally not be able to be guessed. For example, the current time may be a poor seed. Knowing the approximate time the PRNG was seeded greatly reduces the possible key space. 

 Seeds do not necessarily need to be unique, but reusing seeds may open up attacks if the seed is discovered.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** As of CWE 4.5, terminology related to randomness, entropy, and predictability can vary widely. Within the developer and other communities, "randomness" is used heavily. However, within cryptography, "entropy" is distinct, typically implied as a measurement. There are no commonly-used definitions, even within standards documents and cryptography papers. Future versions of CWE will attempt to define these terms and, if necessary, distinguish between them in ways that are appropriate for different communities but do not reduce the usability of CWE for mapping, understanding, or other scenarios.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2020-7010:** Cloud application on Kubernetes generates passwords using a weak random number generator based on deployment time.
- **CVE-2019-11495:** server uses erlang:now() to seed the PRNG, which results in a small search space for potential random seeds
- **CVE-2018-12520:** Product's PRNG is not seeded for the generation of session IDs




## CWE-338: Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses a Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) in a security context, but the PRNG's algorithm is not cryptographically strong.

### Extended Description


When a non-cryptographic PRNG is used in a cryptographic context, it can expose the cryptography to certain types of attacks.


Often a pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) is not designed for cryptography. Sometimes a mediocre source of randomness is sufficient or preferable for algorithms that use random numbers. Weak generators generally take less processing power and/or do not use the precious, finite, entropy sources on a system. While such PRNGs might have very useful features, these same features could be used to break the cryptography.

## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

### Extended Description


By design, authentication protocols try to ensure that attackers must perform brute force attacks if they do not know the credentials such as a key or password. However, when these credentials are easily predictable or even fixed (as with default or hard-coded passwords and keys), then the attacker can defeat the mechanism without relying on brute force.


Credentials may be weak for different reasons, such as:


  - Hard-coded (i.e., static and unchangeable by the administrator)

  - Default (i.e., the same static value across different deployments/installations, but able to be changed by the administrator)

  - Predictable (i.e., generated in a way that produces unique credentials across deployments/installations, but can still be guessed with reasonable efficiency)

Even if a new, unique credential is intended to be generated for each product installation, if the generation is predictable, then that may also simplify guessing attacks.

## CWE-1204: Generation of Weak Initialization Vector (IV)
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses a cryptographic primitive that uses an Initialization
			Vector (IV), but the product does not generate IVs that are
			sufficiently unpredictable or unique according to the expected
			cryptographic requirements for that primitive.
			

### Extended Description
By design, some cryptographic primitives (such as block ciphers) require that IVs must have certain properties for the uniqueness and/or unpredictability of an IV. Primitives may vary in how important these properties are. If these properties are not maintained, e.g. by a bug in the code, then the cryptography may be weakened or broken by attacking the IVs themselves.
