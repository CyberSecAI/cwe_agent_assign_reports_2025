CWE-125 is a more specific child of CWE-119, and the vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"out-of-bounds read,\" making CWE-125 the more appropriate choice.

The vulnerability description explicitly states \"out-of-bounds read vulnerability.\" The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section also confirms that the root cause is an \"Out-of-bounds Read\" and identifies it as CWE-125.\n\nThe graph relationships show that CWE-125 is a child of CWE-119, which represents a broader class of improper restrictions within memory buffers. While CWE-119 could be considered, the explicit mention of \"out-of-bounds read\" makes CWE-125 the more specific and appropriate choice.\n\nThe selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly reflects the described vulnerability, as supported by the evidence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-788: Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads or writes to a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location after the end of the buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: The CWE entry might be misused when lower-level CWE entries might be available.
