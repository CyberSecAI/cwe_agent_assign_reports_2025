  "description": "Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Starting in version 11.0.0 and prior to version 11.3.0, when setting `WEBSOCKETS_GRAPHQL_AUTH` or `WEBSOCKETS_REST_AUTH` to public, an unauthenticated user is able to do any of the supported operations (CRUD, subscriptions) with full admin privileges. This impacts any Directus instance that has either `WEBSOCKETS_GRAPHQL_AUTH` or `WEBSOCKETS_REST_AUTH` set to `public` allowing unauthenticated users to subscribe for changes on any collection or do REST CRUD operations on user defined collections ignoring permissions. Version 11.3.0 fixes the issue.",

  },
  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-54151:\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe vulnerability stems from how Directus handles unauthenticated WebSocket connections when `WEBSOCKETS_GRAPHQL_AUTH` or `WEBSOCKETS_REST_AUTH` are set to \"public\". Instead of assigning public permissions to these unauthenticated users, the system defaulted to `null` accountability, which, due to a recent permissions policy update, equates to system/admin level access.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n- **Incorrect Default Permissions:** Unauthenticated WebSocket connections were not properly assigned public permissions, leading to unintended access levels.\n- **Bypass of Access Controls:**  The vulnerability allows bypassing access controls, granting unauthorized users the ability to perform actions as if they were administrators.\n- **Exposure of Sensitive Data:** As a result of the incorrect permissions, sensitive data, such as user details, could be accessed through subscriptions or CRUD operations.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Full Admin Privileges:** Unauthenticated users gain the ability to execute any supported operations (CRUD, subscriptions) as if they were system administrators.\n- **Data Exposure:** Unauthorized users can access sensitive data within the database via websockets.\n- **CRUD Operations:** Unauthorized users can perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on user-defined collections, bypassing intended permissions.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Network:** The attack can be performed remotely over the network.\n- **WebSockets:** The attack is carried out through the WebSocket interface.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **No Privileges Required:** The attacker does not need any prior authentication to exploit the vulnerability.\n- **Network Access:** The attacker only needs network access to the Directus instance.\n\n**Technical Details:**\n- The fix involves changing how accountability is set for unauthenticated websocket requests. Instead of setting it to `null`, the fix uses `createDefaultAccountability()` which ensures that public permissions are used for unauthenticated users.\n- The vulnerability is present in versions >= 11.0.0 of Directus.\n- The fix is available in version 11.3.0.\n- The vulnerability is present if  `WEBSOCKETS_GRAPHQL_AUTH` or `WEBSOCKETS_REST_AUTH` is set to `public`\n- The vulnerability allows an attacker to subscribe for changes on any collection or do REST CRUD operations on user defined collections ignoring permissions.\n\nThis analysis provides more detail than the initial CVE description, which was a placeholder.",

This bypasses access controls, leading to the ability for unauthenticated users to perform actions with full admin privileges, as well as **exposure of sensitive data**. The initial flaw is the **missing authorization**, enabling unauthorized access and operations.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary assessment centers on identifying the root cause that allows unauthenticated users to perform actions with admin privileges.\n\nThe evidence from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary states:\n- \"**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from how Directus handles unauthenticated WebSocket connections when `WEBSOCKETS_GRAPHQL_AUTH` or `WEBSOCKETS_REST_AUTH` are set to \"public\".\"\n- \"**Incorrect Default Permissions:** Unauthenticated WebSocket connections were not properly assigned public permissions, leading to unintended access levels.\"\n- \"**Bypass of Access Controls:** The vulnerability allows bypassing access controls, granting unauthorized users the ability to perform actions as if they were administrators.\"\n\nGiven this evidence, and the retriever result that shows CWE-862 **Missing Authorization** as the best match, the primary CWE is CWE-862.\n\nCWE-284 **Improper Access Control** is a parent of CWE-862 and is a more general case. It is used when no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable. In this case, the authorization is completely missing, so it is not the best choice. Therefore, it is a secondary candidate.\n\nCWE-306 **Missing Authentication for Critical Function** is also related to the vulnerability. If the system had proper authentication, it could then enforce authorization policies. However, the vulnerability specifically highlights the authorization **missing** as the primary issue. Therefore, it is a secondary candidate.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
