# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-54151

## Vulnerability Description
Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Starting in version 11.0.0 and prior to version 11.3.0, when setting `WEBSOCKETS_GRAPHQL_AUTH` or `WEBSOCKETS_REST_AUTH` to public, an unauthenticated user is able to do any of the supported operations (CRUD, subscriptions) with full admin privileges. This impacts any Directus instance that has either `WEBSOCKETS_GRAPHQL_AUTH` or `WEBSOCKETS_REST_AUTH` set to `public` allowing unauthenticated users to subscribe for changes on any collection or do REST CRUD operations on user defined collections ignoring permissions. Version 11.3.0 fixes the issue.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** do any of the supported operations (CRUD, subscriptions) with full admin privileges
- **attacker:** unauthenticated user
- **product:** Directus
- **version:** Starting in version 11.0.0 and prior to version 11.3.0

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-54151:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from how Directus handles unauthenticated WebSocket connections when `WEBSOCKETS_GRAPHQL_AUTH` or `WEBSOCKETS_REST_AUTH` are set to "public". Instead of assigning public permissions to these unauthenticated users, the system defaulted to `null` accountability, which, due to a recent permissions policy update, equates to system/admin level access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Incorrect Default Permissions:** Unauthenticated WebSocket connections were not properly assigned public permissions, leading to unintended access levels.
- **Bypass of Access Controls:**  The vulnerability allows bypassing access controls, granting unauthorized users the ability to perform actions as if they were administrators.
- **Exposure of Sensitive Data:** As a result of the incorrect permissions, sensitive data, such as user details, could be accessed through subscriptions or CRUD operations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Full Admin Privileges:** Unauthenticated users gain the ability to execute any supported operations (CRUD, subscriptions) as if they were system administrators.
- **Data Exposure:** Unauthorized users can access sensitive data within the database via websockets.
- **CRUD Operations:** Unauthorized users can perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on user-defined collections, bypassing intended permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack can be performed remotely over the network.
- **WebSockets:** The attack is carried out through the WebSocket interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Privileges Required:** The attacker does not need any prior authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Network Access:** The attacker only needs network access to the Directus instance.

**Technical Details:**
- The fix involves changing how accountability is set for unauthenticated websocket requests. Instead of setting it to `null`, the fix uses `createDefaultAccountability()` which ensures that public permissions are used for unauthenticated users.
- The vulnerability is present in versions >= 11.0.0 of Directus.
- The fix is available in version 11.3.0.
- The vulnerability is present if  `WEBSOCKETS_GRAPHQL_AUTH` or `WEBSOCKETS_REST_AUTH` is set to `public`
- The vulnerability allows an attacker to subscribe for changes on any collection or do REST CRUD operations on user defined collections ignoring permissions.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* 🔍 *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* 🔍 *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion – CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### 🔸 CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ✅ *“A user created with the ‘guest’ role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ✅ *“The backup service runs as root but only needs read access.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ⚠️ This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### 🔸 CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ✅ *“User can access another user’s invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.”*

## Mapping Examples – Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *“User can escalate privileges to admin.”*
> ❌ Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged – only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ✅ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**

## Good Mapping Examples – Privileges & Permissions

* ✅ **CWE-266**: *“When a new user registers, the system assigns them admin role due to a missing role validation.”*
* ✅ **CWE-250**: *“Installer runs with system-level privileges but doesn't require them to install files in the user directory.”*
* ✅ **CWE-284**: *“Inconsistent access rules between UI and backend for sensitive endpoints.”*
* ✅ **CWE-285**: *“Authorization logic fails to restrict access to finance reports based on department.”*
