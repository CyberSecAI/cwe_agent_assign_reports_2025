# Retrieval Query for CVE-2024-54151

## Vulnerability Description
Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Starting in version 11.0.0 and prior to version 11.3.0, when setting `WEBSOCKETS_GRAPHQL_AUTH` or `WEBSOCKETS_REST_AUTH` to public, an unauthenticated user is able to do any of the supported operations (CRUD, subscriptions) with full admin privileges. This impacts any Directus instance that has either `WEBSOCKETS_GRAPHQL_AUTH` or `WEBSOCKETS_REST_AUTH` set to `public` allowing unauthenticated users to subscribe for changes on any collection or do REST CRUD operations on user defined collections ignoring permissions. Version 11.3.0 fixes the issue.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** do any of the supported operations (CRUD, subscriptions) with full admin privileges
- **attacker:** unauthenticated user
- **product:** Directus
- **version:** Starting in version 11.0.0 and prior to version 11.3.0

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-54151:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from how Directus handles unauthenticated WebSocket connections when `WEBSOCKETS_GRAPHQL_AUTH` or `WEBSOCKETS_REST_AUTH` are set to "public". Instead of assigning public permissions to these unauthenticated users, the system defaulted to `null` accountability, which, due to a recent permissions policy update, equates to system/admin level access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Incorrect Default Permissions:** Unauthenticated WebSocket connections were not properly assigned public permissions, leading to unintended access levels.
- **Bypass of Access Controls:**  The vulnerability allows bypassing access controls, granting unauthorized users the ability to perform actions as if they were administrators.
- **Exposure of Sensitive Data:** As a result of the incorrect permissions, sensitive data, such as user details, could be accessed through subscriptions or CRUD operations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Full Admin Privileges:** Unauthenticated users gain the ability to execute any supported operations (CRUD, subscriptions) as if they were system administrators.
- **Data Exposure:** Unauthorized users can access sensitive data within the database via websockets.
- **CRUD Operations:** Unauthorized users can perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on user-defined collections, bypassing intended permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack can be performed remotely over the network.
- **WebSockets:** The attack is carried out through the WebSocket interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Privileges Required:** The attacker does not need any prior authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Network Access:** The attacker only needs network access to the Directus instance.

**Technical Details:**
- The fix involves changing how accountability is set for unauthenticated websocket requests. Instead of setting it to `null`, the fix uses `createDefaultAccountability()` which ensures that public permissions are used for unauthenticated users.
- The vulnerability is present in versions >= 11.0.0 of Directus.
- The fix is available in version 11.3.0.
- The vulnerability is present if  `WEBSOCKETS_GRAPHQL_AUTH` or `WEBSOCKETS_REST_AUTH` is set to `public`
- The vulnerability allows an attacker to subscribe for changes on any collection or do REST CRUD operations on user defined collections ignoring permissions.

This analysis provides more detail than the initial CVE description, which was a placeholder.

## CWE-285: Improper Authorization
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.

### Extended Description


Assuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.


When access control checks are not applied consistently - or not at all - users are able to access data or perform actions that they should not be allowed to perform. This can lead to a wide range of problems, including information exposures, denial of service, and arbitrary code execution.


### Alternative Terms
AuthZ: "AuthZ" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authorization" within the web application security community. It is distinct from "AuthN" (or, sometimes, "AuthC") which is an abbreviation of "authentication." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.

## CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product allocates a reusable resource or group of resources on behalf of an actor without imposing any restrictions on the size or number of resources that can be allocated, in violation of the intended security policy for that actor.

### Extended Description


Code frequently has to work with limited resources, so programmers must be careful to ensure that resources are not consumed too quickly, or too easily. Without use of quotas, resource limits, or other protection mechanisms, it can be easy for an attacker to consume many resources by rapidly making many requests, or causing larger resources to be used than is needed. When too many resources are allocated, or if a single resource is too large, then it can prevent the code from working correctly, possibly leading to a denial of service.

**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This entry is different from uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400) in that there are other weaknesses that are related to inability to control resource consumption, such as holding on to a resource too long after use, or not correctly keeping track of active resources so that they can be managed and released when they are finished (CWE-771).

**[Theoretical]** Vulnerability theory is largely about how behaviors and resources interact. "Resource exhaustion" can be regarded as either a consequence or an attack, depending on the perspective. This entry is an attempt to reflect one of the underlying weaknesses that enable these attacks (or consequences) to take place.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).
- **CVE-2009-4017:** Language interpreter does not restrict the number of temporary files being created when handling a MIME request with a large number of parts..
- **CVE-2009-2726:** Driver does not use a maximum width when invoking sscanf style functions, causing stack consumption.




## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or "zeroize" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.

### Extended Description


When resources are released, they can be made available for reuse. For example, after memory is de-allocated, an operating system may make the memory available to another process, or disk space may be reallocated when a file is deleted. As removing information requires time and additional resources, operating systems do not usually clear the previously written information.


Even when the resource is reused by the same process, this weakness can arise when new data is not as large as the old data, which leaves portions of the old data still available. Equivalent errors can occur in other situations where the length of data is variable but the associated data structure is not. If memory is not cleared after use, the information may be read by less trustworthy parties when the memory is reallocated.


This weakness can apply in hardware, such as when a device or system switches between power, sleep, or debug states during normal operation, or when execution changes to different users or privilege levels.

**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** There is a close association between CWE-226 and CWE-212. The difference is partially that of perspective. CWE-226 is geared towards the final stage of the resource lifecycle, in which the resource is deleted, eliminated, expired, or otherwise released for reuse. Technically, this involves a transfer to a different control sphere, in which the original contents of the resource are no longer relevant. CWE-212, however, is intended for sensitive data in resources that are intentionally shared with others, so they are still active. This distinction is useful from the perspective of the CWE research view (CWE-1000).

**[Maintenance]** This entry needs modification to clarify the differences with CWE-212. The description also combines two problems that are distinct from the CWE research perspective: the inadvertent transfer of information to another sphere, and improper initialization/shutdown. Some of the associated taxonomy mappings reflect these different uses.

**[Research Gap]** This is frequently found for network packets, but it can also exist in local memory allocation, files, etc.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2019-3733:** Cryptography library does not clear heap memory before release
- **CVE-2003-0001:** Ethernet NIC drivers do not pad frames with null bytes, leading to infoleak from malformed packets.
- **CVE-2003-0291:** router does not clear information from DHCP packets that have been previously used




## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.

### Extended Description


Improper encoding or escaping can allow attackers to change the commands that are sent to another component, inserting malicious commands instead.


Most products follow a certain protocol that uses structured messages for communication between components, such as queries or commands. These structured messages can contain raw data interspersed with metadata or control information. For example, "GET /index.html HTTP/1.1" is a structured message containing a command ("GET") with a single argument ("/index.html") and metadata about which protocol version is being used ("HTTP/1.1").


If an application uses attacker-supplied inputs to construct a structured message without properly encoding or escaping, then the attacker could insert special characters that will cause the data to be interpreted as control information or metadata. Consequently, the component that receives the output will perform the wrong operations, or otherwise interpret the data incorrectly.

**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This weakness is primary to all weaknesses related to injection (CWE-74) since the inherent nature of injection involves the violation of structured messages.

**[Relationship]** 

CWE-116 and CWE-20 have a close association because, depending on the nature of the structured message, proper input validation can indirectly prevent special characters from changing the meaning of a structured message. For example, by validating that a numeric ID field should only contain the 0-9 characters, the programmer effectively prevents injection attacks.


However, input validation is not always sufficient, especially when less stringent data types must be supported, such as free-form text. Consider a SQL injection scenario in which a last name is inserted into a query. The name "O'Reilly" would likely pass the validation step since it is a common last name in the English language. However, it cannot be directly inserted into the database because it contains the "'" apostrophe character, which would need to be escaped or otherwise neutralized. In this case, stripping the apostrophe might reduce the risk of SQL injection, but it would produce incorrect behavior because the wrong name would be recorded.


**[Terminology]** The usage of the "encoding" and "escaping" terms varies widely. For example, in some programming languages, the terms are used interchangeably, while other languages provide APIs that use both terms for different tasks. This overlapping usage extends to the Web, such as the "escape" JavaScript function whose purpose is stated to be encoding. The concepts of encoding and escaping predate the Web by decades. Given such a context, it is difficult for CWE to adopt a consistent vocabulary that will not be misinterpreted by some constituency.

**[Theoretical]** This is a data/directive boundary error in which data boundaries are not sufficiently enforced before it is sent to a different control sphere.

**[Research Gap]** While many published vulnerabilities are related to insufficient output encoding, there is such an emphasis on input validation as a protection mechanism that the underlying causes are rarely described. Within CVE, the focus is primarily on well-understood issues like cross-site scripting and SQL injection. It is likely that this weakness frequently occurs in custom protocols that support multiple encodings, which are not necessarily detectable with automated techniques.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-41232:** Chain: authentication routine in Go-based agile development product does not escape user name (CWE-116), allowing LDAP injection (CWE-90)
- **CVE-2008-4636:** OS command injection in backup software using shell metacharacters in a filename; correct behavior would require that this filename could not be changed.
- **CVE-2008-0769:** Web application does not set the charset when sending a page to a browser, allowing for XSS exploitation when a browser chooses an unexpected encoding.




## CWE-284: Improper Access Control
**Abstraction:** Pillar
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product does not restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor.

### Extended Description


Access control involves the use of several protection mechanisms such as:


  - Authentication (proving the identity of an actor)

  - Authorization (ensuring that a given actor can access a resource), and

  - Accountability (tracking of activities that were performed)

When any mechanism is not applied or otherwise fails, attackers can compromise the security of the product by gaining privileges, reading sensitive information, executing commands, evading detection, etc.

There are two distinct behaviors that can introduce access control weaknesses:


  - Specification: incorrect privileges, permissions, ownership, etc. are explicitly specified for either the user or the resource (for example, setting a password file to be world-writable, or giving administrator capabilities to a guest user). This action could be performed by the program or the administrator.

  - Enforcement: the mechanism contains errors that prevent it from properly enforcing the specified access control requirements (e.g., allowing the user to specify their own privileges, or allowing a syntactically-incorrect ACL to produce insecure settings). This problem occurs within the program itself, in that it does not actually enforce the intended security policy that the administrator specifies.



### Alternative Terms
Authorization: The terms "access control" and "authorization" are often used interchangeably, although many people have distinct definitions. The CWE usage of "access control" is intended as a general term for the various mechanisms that restrict which users can access which resources, and "authorization" is more narrowly defined. It is unlikely that there will be community consensus on the use of these terms.

### Relationships
None

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-284 is extremely high-level, a Pillar. Its name, "Improper Access Control," is often misused in low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287] or by active use of the OWASP Top Ten, such as "A01:2021-Broken Access Control". It is not useful for trend analysis.
**Comments:** Consider using descendants of CWE-284 that are more specific to the kind of access control involved, such as those involving authorization (Missing Authorization (CWE-862), Incorrect Authorization (CWE-863), Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource (CWE-732), etc.); authentication (Missing Authentication (CWE-306) or Weak Authentication (CWE-1390)); Incorrect User Management (CWE-286); Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints (CWE-923); etc.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse
- Abstraction
**Suggested Alternatives:**
- CWE-862: Missing Authorization
- CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization
- CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource
- CWE-306: Missing Authentication
- CWE-1390: Weak Authentication
- CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** 

This entry needs more work. Possible sub-categories include:


  - Trusted group includes undesired entities (partially covered by CWE-286)

  - Group can perform undesired actions

  - ACL parse error does not fail closed





### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-24985:** A form hosting website only checks the session authentication status for a single form, making it possible to bypass authentication when there are multiple forms
- **CVE-2022-29238:** Access-control setting in web-based document collaboration tool is not properly implemented by the code, which prevents listing hidden directories but does not prevent direct requests to files in those directories.
- **CVE-2022-23607:** Python-based HTTP library did not scope cookies to a particular domain such that "supercookies" could be sent to any domain on redirect




## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.

### Extended Description


Attackers may be able to bypass weak authentication faster and/or with less effort than expected.
