CWE-532 focuses on the insecure logging practice, while CWE-200 represents the resulting exposure of sensitive information. CWE-200 is a class, while CWE-532 is a base, so CWE-532 is more specific.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe532[\"CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n\n    cwe532 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe200\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe532 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **root cause**, **insertion of JWT tokens into a log file** (CWE-532). This leads to the **impact** of **exposure of sensitive information to unauthorized actors** (CWE-200). An attacker can then use the JWT tokens to log in as other users.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, which clearly indicates that the CE21 Suite plugin stores JWT tokens in a publicly accessible log file (plugin-log.txt). This constitutes the **root cause** of the vulnerability. The direct consequence of this insecure storage is the exposure of sensitive information, allowing unauthenticated attackers to potentially gain administrative access by using the exposed JWT tokens.\n\nCWE-532 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File) is the most appropriate primary CWE because it accurately describes the **root cause** of the vulnerability, which is the **insecure storage of JWT tokens in a publicly accessible log file**.\n\nCWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) is considered a secondary CWE as it describes the **impact** of the vulnerability, which is the **exposure of the JWT tokens to unauthenticated attackers**.\n\nThe retriever results listed CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) and CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function). These were not chosen because the **root cause** is not a missing authorization or authentication check, but the **insecure storage of sensitive information**. The attacker is not bypassing authentication or authorization; they are exploiting exposed credentials.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n*   CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File\n*   CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor",
