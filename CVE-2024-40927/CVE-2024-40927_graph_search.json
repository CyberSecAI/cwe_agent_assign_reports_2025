This problem case dates back to commit e9df17eb1408 (USB xhci Correct assumptions about number of rings per endpoint.) early on in the XHCI drivers life, when stream support was first added. It was then identified but not fixed nor made into a warning in commit 674f8438c121 (xhci split handling halted endpoints into two steps), which added a FIXME comment for the problem case (without materially changing the behavior as far as I can tell, though the new logic made the problem more obvious).
