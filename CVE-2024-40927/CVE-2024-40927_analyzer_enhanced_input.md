## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved xhci Handle TD clearing for multiple streams case When multiple streams are in use, **multiple TDs might be in flight when an endpoint is stopped**. We need to issue a Set TR Dequeue Pointer for each, to ensure everything is reset properly and the caches cleared. Change the logic so that any N>1 TDs found active for different streams are deferred until after the first one is processed, calling xhci_invalidate_cancelled_tds() again from xhci_handle_cmd_set_deq() to queue another command until we are done with all of them. Also change the error/should never happen paths to ensure we at least clear any affected TDs, even if we cant issue a command to clear the hardware cache, and complain loudly with an xhci_warn() if this ever happens. This problem case dates back to commit e9df17eb1408 (USB xhci Correct assumptions about number of rings per endpoint.) early on in the XHCI drivers life, when stream support was first added. It was then identified but not fixed nor made into a warning in commit 674f8438c121 (xhci split handling halted endpoints into two steps), which added a FIXME comment for the problem case (without materially changing the behavior as far as I can tell, though the new logic made the problem more obvious). Then later, in commit 94f339147fc3 (xhci Fix failure to give back some cached cancelled URBs.), it was acknowledged again. [Mathias commit 94f339147fc3 (xhci Fix failure to

- **rootcause:** **multiple TDs might be in flight when an endpoint is stopped**
- **impact:** insufficient cache flushing
- **product:** Linux kernel
- **component:** xhci

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause lies in the XHCI (eXtensible Host Controller Interface) driver's incorrect handling of Transfer Descriptors (TDs) when multiple streams are used for a USB endpoint. When an endpoint is stopped, multiple TDs associated with different streams could be in flight. The driver failed to properly clear these TDs, particularly their cached states, which resulted in a use-after-free condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Improper TD Clearing:** The XHCI driver did not correctly handle the case where multiple TDs for different streams were active when an endpoint was stopped. It would only clear one TD, leaving others in a cached state, leading to a use-after-free.
- **Lack of Warning/Logging:** The driver logged the issue using `xhci_dbg()`, which is not enabled by default, masking a severe issue. This made the issue extremely hard to debug in real world scenarios.
- **Incorrect assumption about number of rings per endpoint:** The original code was assuming a single ring per endpoint, and did not account for multiple rings, leading to the bug.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **xHC Crashes and IOMMU Faults:**  The primary impact was observed as xHC (XHCI Host Controller) crashes and IOMMU faults, particularly with UAS (USB Attached SCSI) devices when handling errors. This is because a stale TD could reference DMA pages that have already been unmapped.
- **Memory Corruption:** On systems without an IOMMU, the vulnerability would silently corrupt freed memory, leading to unpredictable behavior and potential security issues.
- **Use-After-Free (UAF):** A malicious USB device, pretending to be a UAS device, could deliberately trigger the UAF by reporting errors with the right timing, allowing for writing to freed memory. This constitutes a security vulnerability which could potentially lead to privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious USB Device:** A malicious USB device could trigger the vulnerability by sending specific error responses that lead to cancellation of multiple TDs associated with different streams.
- **Error Handling:** The vulnerability could be triggered via a normal error scenario in UAS devices, such as a read error on a USB storage device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Physical Access:** An attacker would likely need physical access to the target system to connect a malicious USB device.
- **Device Manipulation:** The attacker needs the ability to control a USB device to send specific responses that can trigger the described race condition.
- **UAS device knowledge:** An attacker would need a deeper understanding of the UAS protocol.

**Additional Notes:**
- The issue existed for approximately 14 years and was noted in previous code commits with comments, but was never fully fixed.
- The fix includes a deferred handling mechanism to ensure all TDs associated with different streams are cleared and the cache is updated
- The fix includes more robust error handling and logs a warning message to easily identify the issue in the future.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties.

### Extended Description


Specified quantities include size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, and others. Code may rely on specified quantities to allocate resources, perform calculations, control iteration, etc. When the quantity is not properly validated, then attackers can specify malicious quantities to cause excessive resource allocation, trigger unexpected failures, enable buffer overflows, etc.

## CWE-617: Reachable Assertion
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product contains an assert() or similar statement that can be triggered by an attacker, which leads to an application exit or other behavior that is more severe than necessary.

### Extended Description


While assertion is good for catching logic errors and reducing the chances of reaching more serious vulnerability conditions, it can still lead to a denial of service.


For example, if a server handles multiple simultaneous connections, and an assert() occurs in one single connection that causes all other connections to be dropped, this is a reachable assertion that leads to a denial of service.

- **CVE-2005-0772:** packet with invalid error status value triggers NULL dereference




## CWE-667: Improper Locking
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.

### Extended Description


Locking is a type of synchronization behavior that ensures that multiple independently-operating processes or threads do not interfere with each other when accessing the same resource. All processes/threads are expected to follow the same steps for locking. If these steps are not followed precisely - or if no locking is done at all - then another process/thread could modify the shared resource in a way that is not visible or predictable to the original process. This can lead to data or memory corruption, denial of service, etc.

### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** Deeper research is necessary for synchronization and related mechanisms, including locks, mutexes, semaphores, and other mechanisms. Multiple entries are dependent on this research, which includes relationships to concurrency, race conditions, reentrant functions, etc. CWE-662 and its children - including CWE-667, CWE-820, CWE-821, and others - may need to be modified significantly, along with their relationships.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-1782:** Chain: improper locking (CWE-667) leads to race condition (CWE-362), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2009-0935:** Attacker provides invalid address to a memory-reading function, causing a mutex to be unlocked twice
- **CVE-2010-4210:** function in OS kernel unlocks a mutex that was not previously locked, causing a panic or overwrite of arbitrary memory.




## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.

### Extended Description


A race condition occurs within concurrent environments, and it is effectively a property of a code sequence. Depending on the context, a code sequence may be in the form of a function call, a small number of instructions, a series of program invocations, etc.


A race condition violates these properties, which are closely related:


  - Exclusivity - the code sequence is given exclusive access to the shared resource, i.e., no other code sequence can modify properties of the shared resource before the original sequence has completed execution.

  - Atomicity - the code sequence is behaviorally atomic, i.e., no other thread or process can concurrently execute the same sequence of instructions (or a subset) against the same resource.

A race condition exists when an "interfering code sequence" can still access the shared resource, violating exclusivity.

The interfering code sequence could be "trusted" or "untrusted." A trusted interfering code sequence occurs within the product; it cannot be modified by the attacker, and it can only be invoked indirectly. An untrusted interfering code sequence can be authored directly by the attacker, and typically it is external to the vulnerable product.

**Reasons:**

### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** The relationship between race conditions and synchronization problems (CWE-662) needs to be further developed. They are not necessarily two perspectives of the same core concept, since synchronization is only one technique for avoiding race conditions, and synchronization can be used for other purposes besides race condition prevention.

**[Research Gap]** Race conditions in web applications are under-studied and probably under-reported. However, in 2008 there has been growing interest in this area.

**[Research Gap]** Much of the focus of race condition research has been in Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) variants (CWE-367), but many race conditions are related to synchronization problems that do not necessarily require a time-of-check.

**[Research Gap]** From a classification/taxonomy perspective, the relationships between concurrency and program state need closer investigation and may be useful in organizing related issues.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-29527:** Go application for cloud management creates a world-writable sudoers file that allows local attackers to inject sudo rules and escalate privileges to root by winning a race condition.

- **CVE-2021-0920:** Chain: mobile platform race condition (CWE-362) leading to use-after-free (CWE-416), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.




## CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete
