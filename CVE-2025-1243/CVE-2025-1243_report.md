# Analysis Report for CVE-2025-1243

# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2025-1243

## Description

The Temporal api-go library prior to version 1.44.1 did not send `update response` information to Data Converter when the proxy package within the api-go module was used in a gRPC proxy prior to transmission. This resulted in information contained within the `update response` field not having Data Converter transformations (e.g. encryption) applied. This is an issue only when using the UpdateWorkflowExecution APIs (released on 13th January 2025) with a proxy leveraging the api-go library before version 1.44.1. Other data fields were correctly sent to Data Converter. This issue does not impact the Data Converter server. Data was encrypted in transit. Temporal Cloud services are not impacted.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Weakness:** did not send update response information to Data Converter when the proxy package within the api-go module was used in a gRPC proxy prior to transmission
- **Product:** Temporal api-go library
- **Version:** prior to version 1.44.1

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **CWE-201** | Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data | 0.75 | Base | Primary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.75
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The analysis indicates that the vulnerability involves sending sensitive data without proper transformation. CWE-201 is a base-level CWE that directly addresses this issue. While other CWEs like CWE-212 (Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer) and CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information) are related, CWE-201 is the most precise fit because it focuses on the insertion of sensitive data into sent data, which aligns with the vulnerability description. The hierarchical relationships of other CWEs were considered, but CWE-201 remains the most relevant.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain involves the following:
1.  The api-go library **did not send update response information to Data Converter** when a proxy package within the api-go module was used.
2.  This resulted in information contained within the `update response` field not having Data Converter transformations (e.g., encryption) applied.
3.  Sensitive data was inserted into sent data without proper encryption.
4.  The final impact is the potential exposure of sensitive information.

CWE-201 represents the core issue of sensitive information being included in transmitted data.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is based on the provided evidence, which indicates a **weakness** where the api-go library did not send update response information to the Data Converter for transformation before transmission. This resulted in sensitive information being sent without proper encryption. CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data) is the most appropriate CWE because it directly addresses the issue of sensitive information being included in sent data.

The graph relationships influenced the decision by highlighting related CWEs, but CWE-201's direct relevance to the vulnerability makes it the best choice. The provided evidence focuses on the lack of transformation before sending the data, aligning perfectly with the definition of CWE-201.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-378: Creation of Temporary File With Insecure Permissions
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
Opening temporary files without appropriate measures or controls can leave the file, its contents and any function that it impacts vulnerable to attack.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-208: Observable Timing Discrepancy
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
Two separate operations in a product require different amounts of time to complete, in a way that is observable to an actor and reveals security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-346: Origin Validation Error
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly verify that the source of data or communication is valid.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.

- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-294: Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay
