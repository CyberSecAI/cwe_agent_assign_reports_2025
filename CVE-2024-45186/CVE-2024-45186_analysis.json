The relationships involving CWE-1336 were examined, including its parent CWE-94 (Improper Control of Generation of Code) and peer relationships. The base CWE best captures the specific weakness.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1336[\"CWE-1336: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine\"]\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code\"]\n    \n    cwe1336 -->|CHILDOF| cwe94\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe1336 primary\n    class cwe94 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper neutralization** of special elements used in a template engine (CWE-1336), leading to the ability to retrieve credentials, which is the impact.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, which clearly indicates a **server-side template injection** vulnerability. The vulnerability allows non-authenticated users to inject code into server-side templates to retrieve credentials.\n\nThe Retriever Results strongly suggest CWE-1336 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine) as the most relevant CWE, with a score of 1.0. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions **server-side template injection**, which aligns perfectly with the description of CWE-1336.\n\nThe other CWEs considered were less specific to the root cause. For example, CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')) is a more general injection vulnerability. CWE-94 (Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')) is too broad.\n\nThe selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **server-side template injection** vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-80: Improper
