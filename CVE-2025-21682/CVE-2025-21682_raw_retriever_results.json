The real issue is that the features will randomly come back during another reconfiguration which just happens to invoke netdev_update_features(). The driver doesnt handle reconfiguring two things at a time very robustly. Starting with commit 98ba1d931f61 (bnxt_en Fix RSS logic in __bnxt_reserve_rings()) we only reconfigure the RSS hash table if the effective number of Rx rings has changed. If HW-GRO is enabled effective number of rings is 2x what user sees. So if we are in the bad state, with HW-GRO re-enablement pending after XDP off, and we lower the rings by / 2 - the HW-GRO rings doing 2x and the ethtool -L doing / 2 may cancel each other out, and the if (old_rx_rings != bp->hw_resc.resv_rx_rings && condition in __bnxt_reserve_rings() will be false.
