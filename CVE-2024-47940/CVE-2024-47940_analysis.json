Specifically, the vulnerability occurs when the application reads past the end of an allocated structure.\n- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read.\n- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.\n- **Attack vectors:** An attacker needs to provide a specially crafted PSM file that triggers the vulnerability when opened in Solid Edge.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to entice a user to open the malicious PSM file. The attacker needs to craft a specific PSM file.",

While CWE-119 is a broader class, CWE-125 is a specific base case that directly matches the vulnerability description, which explicitly mentions an **out of bounds read**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    \n    cwe125 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe125 primary\n    class cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the parsing of a specially crafted PSM file, which leads to an **out-of-bounds read** (CWE-125), and ultimately results in the potential for arbitrary code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the explicit description of the vulnerability as an **\"out of bounds read past the end of an allocated structure\"**. This aligns directly with the definition of CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read).\n\nThe \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section reinforces this by stating: \"**Root cause of vulnerability:** An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in the affected application while parsing specially crafted PSM files. Specifically, the vulnerability occurs when the application reads past the end of an allocated structure.\" and \"**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read.\"\n\nThe retriever results also list CWE-125 as a top candidate, with a high similarity score.\n\nCWE-125 is at the Base level of abstraction, which is preferred for root cause analysis. Therefore, CWE-125 is the most appropriate and specific CWE for this vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary.
