## Vulnerability Description
Redis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk. In versions starting from 7.0.0 to before 8.0.2, a **stack-based buffer overflow** exists in redis-check-aof due to the **use of memcpy with strlen(filepath)** when copying a user-supplied file path into a fixed-size stack buffer. This allows an attacker to overflow the stack and potentially achieve code execution. This issue has been patched in version 8.0.2.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **component:** redis-check-aof

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-27151 based on provided content:

**CVE Description:** PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval (as per guidelines)

**Overall:** The provided content details a security fix for CVE-2025-27151 in Redis, specifically within the `redis-check-aof` utility. The vulnerability is a stack overflow potentially leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE). The provided content offers more detail than the placeholder CVE description.

**1. Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a stack-based buffer overflow in `redis-check-aof` due to the use of `memcpy` with `strlen(filepath)` when copying a user-supplied file path into a fixed-size stack buffer.

**2. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **CWE-20:** Improper Input Validation. The code doesn't adequately check the length of the input file path.
*   **CWE-121:** Stack Buffer Overflow.  The `memcpy` operation can write beyond the bounds of the stack buffer if the file path is too long.

**3. Impact of exploitation:**

*   A user can trigger a stack buffer overflow by providing a long file path to `redis-check-aof`.
*   This overflow may potentially lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE).

**4. Attack vectors:**

*   An attacker can supply a crafted, overly long file path as input to the `redis-check-aof` command-line utility.

**5. Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to execute the `redis-check-aof` utility and provide a malicious file path.  Local access is sufficient.

**6. Mitigation or fix:**

*   The fix (commit 643b5db) adds a check to ensure that the length of the input file name does not exceed `PATH_MAX` before copying it into the stack buffer. If the file path is too long, an error message is printed, and the program exits.
*   The fix also includes a comment indicating that the `dirname` function may modify its argument, which is a good practice for defensive programming.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability exists in Redis versions 7.0 and newer.
*   The issue was discovered by Simcha Kosman & CyberArk Labs.
*   The CVSS score is 4.7 (Moderate).
*   The fix has been backported to Redis 8.0 and 8.2.
*   The related pull request is #14081.
*   The initial bug was introduced in #13814.
