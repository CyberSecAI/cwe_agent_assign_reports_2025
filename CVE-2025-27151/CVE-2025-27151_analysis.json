  "description": "Redis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk. In versions starting from 7.0.0 to before 8.0.2, a **stack-based buffer overflow** exists in redis-check-aof due to the **use of memcpy with strlen(filepath)** when copying a user-supplied file path into a fixed-size stack buffer. This allows an attacker to overflow the stack and potentially achieve code execution. This issue has been patched in version 8.0.2.",

  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-27151 based on provided content:\n\n**CVE Description:** PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval (as per guidelines)\n\n**Overall:** The provided content details a security fix for CVE-2025-27151 in Redis, specifically within the `redis-check-aof` utility. The vulnerability is a stack overflow potentially leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE). The provided content offers more detail than the placeholder CVE description.\n\n**1. Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\n*   The vulnerability stems from a stack-based buffer overflow in `redis-check-aof` due to the use of `memcpy` with `strlen(filepath)` when copying a user-supplied file path into a fixed-size stack buffer.\n\n**2. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **CWE-20:** Improper Input Validation. The code doesn't adequately check the length of the input file path.\n*   **CWE-121:** Stack Buffer Overflow.  The `memcpy` operation can write beyond the bounds of the stack buffer if the file path is too long.\n\n**3. Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   A user can trigger a stack buffer overflow by providing a long file path to `redis-check-aof`.\n*   This overflow may potentially lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE).\n\n**4. Attack vectors:**\n\n*   An attacker can supply a crafted, overly long file path as input to the `redis-check-aof` command-line utility.\n\n**5. Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   The attacker needs to be able to execute the `redis-check-aof` utility and provide a malicious file path.  Local access is sufficient.\n\n**6. Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   The fix (commit 643b5db) adds a check to ensure that the length of the input file name does not exceed `PATH_MAX` before copying it into the stack buffer. If the file path is too long, an error message is printed, and the program exits.\n*   The fix also includes a comment indicating that the `dirname` function may modify its argument, which is a good practice for defensive programming.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n*   The vulnerability exists in Redis versions 7.0 and newer.\n*   The issue was discovered by Simcha Kosman & CyberArk Labs.\n*   The CVSS score is 4.7 (Moderate).\n*   The fix has been backported to Redis 8.0 and 8.2.\n*   The related pull request is #14081.\n*   The initial bug was introduced in #13814.",

This is a specific type of CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer (Class). CWE-121 is a child of CWE-119, offering a more precise classification. CWE-131 Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size (Base) can precede CWE-119, as an incorrect size calculation can lead to a buffer overflow. Therefore, we consider CWE-131 as a contributing factor.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe121[\"CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe131[\"CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\"]\n    \n    cwe121 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe131 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe121 primary\n    class cwe119,cwe131 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **use of memcpy with strlen(filepath)** without proper bounds checking (CWE-131), leading to a stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121), which can potentially lead to code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-121 Stack-based Buffer Overflow because the vulnerability description specifically mentions a \"**stack-based buffer overflow**\". The **root cause** is the \"**use of memcpy with strlen(filepath)**\", indicating the lack of input validation and **incorrect** calculation of the buffer size. The evidence is strong because the vulnerability description directly states the type of overflow and the problematic function call. CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer is the more general case of the buffer overflow and parent of CWE-121, so it is classified as secondary.
