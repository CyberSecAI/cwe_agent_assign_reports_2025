  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-0391 based on provided content\n\nThis content **IS RELATED** to CVE-2025-0391. It provides a detailed vulnerability report for JEEWMS, specifically outlining an SQL injection vulnerability. Here's a breakdown of the information extracted:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation and sanitization of the `id` parameter in the `CgFormBuildController.do?saveOrUpdate` request. The code directly uses the `id` parameter in an SQL query without proper filtering, allowing for malicious SQL code injection.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a classic SQL injection flaw.\n*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The code fails to validate or sanitize user-supplied input (the `id` parameter) before incorporating it into an SQL query.\n*   **Direct SQL Construction:** The code constructs SQL queries by directly concatenating strings, making it susceptible to injection attacks.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to:\n\n*   **Read sensitive data:** Access unauthorized information from the database.\n*   **Modify data:** Alter or delete data within the database.\n*   **Execute arbitrary code:** Potentially gain control of the database server.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP request with a specially crafted `id` parameter.\n*   **POC Example:** The provided Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrates the vulnerability using the following URL:\n    ```\n    http://localhost:8083/jeewms/cgFormBuildController.do?saveOrUpdate&bpm_status=&create_by=&create_date=&create_name=&id='and/**/updatexml(1,concat(0x7e,user(),0x7e),1)and'&sys_company_code=&sys_org_code=&tableName=wm_wendu&update_by=&update_date=&update_name=&wendu_bz=1&wendu_cjsj=2024-05-09+11%3A12%3A41&wendu_dd=1&wendu_zhi=1\n    ```\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   **Authenticated Access:** The POC shows the attacker needs to be logged in as a user (e.g., `admin/llg123`).\n*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the JEEWMS application.\n*   **Understanding of SQL Injection:** The attacker needs knowledge of SQL injection techniques to craft a malicious payload.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\nThe report doesn't explicitly state a fix, but the following mitigations are implied:\n\n*   **Parameterized Queries:** Use parameterized queries (prepared statements) to separate SQL code from user-supplied data.\n*   **Input Validation:** Implement robust input validation to ensure that the `id` parameter conforms to expected data types and formats.\n*   **Output Encoding:** Encode output to prevent malicious code from being interpreted as executable code.\n*   **Least Privilege:** Ensure that the database user account used by the application has only the necessary privileges.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n*   **Vulnerable Product:** JEEWMS\n*   **Vulnerable Version:** Before 2025.01.01\n*   **Reported by:** Chaitin Security Research Lab\n*   The report provides specific file paths and line numbers within the JEEWMS codebase where the vulnerability exists, aiding in remediation.\n*   The report includes screenshots illustrating the code flow and the point of injection.\n\nThis content provides significantly more detail than a typical CVE description, offering a comprehensive analysis of the vulnerability, its root cause, and potential exploitation methods.",

The vulnerability stems from **insufficient input validation and sanitization** of the `id` parameter, which is then directly used in an SQL query.|\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship that influenced the decision was the direct match of the vulnerability to the description of CWE-89. There were no parent-child or chain relationships necessary to consider for this particular case, as the evidence clearly pointed to an SQL Injection vulnerability due to **improper neutralization of special elements** in an SQL command.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe89 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward:\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Insufficient input validation and sanitization** of the `id` parameter.\n2.  **Weakness:** **Improper Neutralization of Special Elements** used in an SQL Command (CWE-89).\n3.  **Impact:** Potential for reading sensitive data, modifying data, or executing arbitrary code on the database server.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based heavily on the provided evidence, specifically the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\". This section clearly states that the root cause is **insufficient input validation** of the `id` parameter and its direct use in an SQL query without proper filtering, resulting in an SQL injection vulnerability. The vulnerability description key phrases also highlight \"**sql injection, SQL injection**\".\n\nThe retriever results strongly support CWE-89, with a score of 1.0. The complete CWE specifications for CWE-89 precisely match the vulnerability's characteristics.\n\nThe decision to select CWE-89 is based on the clear evidence of **improper neutralization of special elements** in an SQL command, which is the defining characteristic of this CWE. The abstraction level is optimal as it's a Base level CWE, providing sufficient specificity.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-917: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an expression language (EL) statement in a framework such as a Java Server Page (JSP) using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended EL statement before it is executed.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
