  "description": "OpenCTI is an open-source cyber threat intelligence platform. In versions below 6.2.18, because the function to limit the rate of OTP does not exist, an attacker with valid credentials or a malicious user who commits internal fraud can break through the two-factor authentication and hijack the account. This is because the otpLogin mutation **does not implement One Time Password rate limiting**. As of time of publication, it is unknown whether a patch is available.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n*   **Root Cause:** The primary cause is the absence of rate limiting on the One-Time Password (OTP) login functionality. Specifically, the `otpLogin` mutation lacks any mechanism to restrict the number of OTP attempts.\n\n*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n    *   **CWE-307:** Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts. This weakness is explicitly identified as being related to the vulnerability\n    *   Lack of rate limiting on OTP login attempts.\n\n*   **Impact of Exploitation:**\n    *   **Account Takeover:** Attackers, having obtained valid user credentials through phishing, dark web leaks, or similar means, can bypass the two-factor authentication (2FA) by brute-forcing OTPs.\n    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Successful account takeovers lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information.\n    *   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers may be able to modify content or data within the system.\n\n*   **Attack Vectors:**\n    *   **Network:** The attack is network-based. Attackers can exploit the vulnerability remotely.\n\n*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n    *   **Valid Credentials:** Attackers must possess valid usernames and passwords for targeted accounts. These credentials can be obtained through various means, such as phishing or leaks.\n    *   **Remote Access:** Attackers require network access to the system to initiate the brute-force attempts.\n\n*   **CVSS Metrics:**\n    *   **Attack Vector (AV):** Network (N)\n    *   **Attack Complexity (AC):** Low (L)\n    *   **Privileges Required (PR):** High (H) - The attacker needs to have valid user credentials\n    *   **User Interaction (UI):** None (N)\n    *   **Scope (S):** Unchanged (U)\n    *   **Confidentiality (C):** High (H)\n    *   **Integrity (I):** High (H)\n    *   **Availability (A):** None (N)\n    *   **CVSS Score:** 6.5\n    *   **CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N\n\n*   **Affected Versions:** Versions of OpenCTI prior to 6.2.18 are affected.\n*   **Patched Versions:** No patched versions are mentioned in the content provided, which indicates that a fix is not available yet, and is being tracked by GHSA-hg56-r6hh-56j7.\n\nThis vulnerability allows attackers who have obtained valid user credentials to bypass 2FA and gain unauthorized access to accounts, potentially leading to data breaches, content manipulation, and other malicious activities.",

Since the vulnerability description clearly indicates the **lack of rate limiting** on OTP attempts, CWE-307, being a more specific child of CWE-1390, was chosen as the primary CWE. The chain relationship isn't directly applicable here, as the vulnerability is more about a missing control rather than a sequence of events.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe307[\"CWE-307: Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n    \n    cwe307 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1390\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe307 primary\n    class cwe1390 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain consists of:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Missing rate limiting** on OTP login attempts (CWE-307).\n2.  **Weakness:** The lack of rate limiting leads to a weak authentication mechanism (CWE-1390).\n3.  **Impact:** Attackers can bypass 2FA and hijack accounts.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly pointed towards CWE-307 due to the explicit mention of **missing rate limiting** in both the vulnerability description and the CVE reference content summary. The retriever results also listed CWE-307 as the top candidate.\n\nThe relationship analysis confirmed this by showing that CWE-307 is a specific type of weak authentication (CWE-1390). The decision to choose CWE-307 over CWE-1390 was based on the principle of selecting the most specific CWE that accurately represents the vulnerability.\n\nThe evidence from the vulnerability description is clear: \"**does not implement One Time Password rate limiting**\". This statement directly supports the selection of CWE-307.
