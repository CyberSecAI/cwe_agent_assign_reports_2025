# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-45404

## Vulnerability Description
OpenCTI is an open-source cyber threat intelligence platform. In versions below 6.2.18, because the function to limit the rate of OTP does not exist, an attacker with valid credentials or a malicious user who commits internal fraud can break through the two-factor authentication and hijack the account. This is because the otpLogin mutation **does not implement One Time Password rate limiting**. As of time of publication, it is unknown whether a patch is available.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **does not implement One Time Password rate limiting**
- **impact:** break through the two-factor authentication and hijack the account
- **attacker:** attacker with valid credentials or malicious user
- **product:** OpenCTI
- **version:** below 6.2.18
- **component:** otpLogin mutation

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The primary cause is the absence of rate limiting on the One-Time Password (OTP) login functionality. Specifically, the `otpLogin` mutation lacks any mechanism to restrict the number of OTP attempts.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **CWE-307:** Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts. This weakness is explicitly identified as being related to the vulnerability
    *   Lack of rate limiting on OTP login attempts.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Account Takeover:** Attackers, having obtained valid user credentials through phishing, dark web leaks, or similar means, can bypass the two-factor authentication (2FA) by brute-forcing OTPs.
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Successful account takeovers lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information.
    *   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers may be able to modify content or data within the system.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Network:** The attack is network-based. Attackers can exploit the vulnerability remotely.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Valid Credentials:** Attackers must possess valid usernames and passwords for targeted accounts. These credentials can be obtained through various means, such as phishing or leaks.
    *   **Remote Access:** Attackers require network access to the system to initiate the brute-force attempts.

*   **CVSS Metrics:**
    *   **Attack Vector (AV):** Network (N)
    *   **Attack Complexity (AC):** Low (L)
    *   **Privileges Required (PR):** High (H) - The attacker needs to have valid user credentials
    *   **User Interaction (UI):** None (N)
    *   **Scope (S):** Unchanged (U)
    *   **Confidentiality (C):** High (H)
    *   **Integrity (I):** High (H)
    *   **Availability (A):** None (N)
    *   **CVSS Score:** 6.5
    *   **CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N

*   **Affected Versions:** Versions of OpenCTI prior to 6.2.18 are affected.
*   **Patched Versions:** No patched versions are mentioned in the content provided, which indicates that a fix is not available yet, and is being tracked by GHSA-hg56-r6hh-56j7.

This vulnerability allows attackers who have obtained valid user credentials to bypass 2FA and gain unauthorized access to accounts, potentially leading to data breaches, content manipulation, and other malicious activities.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control

**Authentication**:
Determines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.

* Example phrases: "user must log in", "lack of login check", "bypasses login"
* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.

  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* – used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).

**Authorization**:
Determines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do. It decides access *after* identity is verified.

* Example phrases: "unauthorized access", "regular user can access admin panel", "role checks are missing"
* CWE relevance: use CWEs like 862, 863, 285 for authorization errors:

  * **CWE-862**: *Missing Authorization* – the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all.
  * **CWE-863**: *Incorrect Authorization* – the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).
  * **CWE-285**: *Improper Authorization* – general category for any flawed authorization logic or design.

**Access Control**:
A broader term that includes both authentication and authorization. Governs how resources are protected and who can access them under what conditions.

* CWE relevance:

  * **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* – top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear.
  * This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.

## Mapping Discussion – Common Misclassification Patterns

### 1. **CWE-306 vs CWE-862**:

* **306** is about lack of **authentication** (e.g., *no login required at all*).
* **862** is about lack of **authorization** *after* authentication (e.g., *admin check missing*).
* ✅ Example CWE-306: *“An unauthenticated attacker can invoke the password reset API.”*
* ✅ Example CWE-862: *“An authenticated user without admin privileges can delete any user account.”*

### 2. **CWE-285 vs CWE-284**:

* **285** is specific to authorization flaws – it's a better choice than 284 **if** the issue involves *improper or missing role checks*.
* **284** should be reserved for general access control issues when it’s unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.

---

## Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification

**Phrase like "unauthorized access" is not enough.**

* If you **cannot determine whether identity was checked**, assume it’s **authorization** and consider 862 or 863.
* If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** → CWE-306.
* If the **access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced**, but it's not due to missing checks, consider **CWE-284**.

---

## Good Mapping Examples

* ✅ **CWE-306**: “The endpoint `/admin/deleteUser` does not require any authentication.”
* ✅ **CWE-862**: “Any logged-in user can change any other user's email without being an admin.”
* ✅ **CWE-863**: “An admin check exists but incorrectly grants access to non-admin users.”
* ✅ **CWE-285**: “Application uses a static role check that fails when roles change dynamically.”
* ✅ **CWE-284**: “Inconsistent enforcement of access rules across services with unclear policy source.”

| No role/privilege check after login                        | CWE-862        |
| Role check is present but flawed                           | CWE-863        |
| General or ambiguous authorization failure                 | CWE-285        |
| High-level access control problem with no clear root cause | CWE-284        |
