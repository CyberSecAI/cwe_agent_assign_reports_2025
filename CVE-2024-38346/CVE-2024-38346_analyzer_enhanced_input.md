## Vulnerability Description
The CloudStack cluster service runs on unauthenticated port (default 9090) that can be misused to run arbitrary commands on targeted hypervisors and CloudStack management server hosts. Some of these commands were found to have **command injection** vulnerabilities that can result in arbitrary code execution via agents on the hosts that may run as a privileged user. An attacker that can reach the cluster service on the unauthenticated port (default 9090), can exploit this to perform remote code execution on CloudStack managed hosts and result in complete compromise of the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of CloudStack managed infrastructure. Users are recommended to restrict the network access to the cluster service port (default 9090) on a CloudStack management server host to only its peer CloudStack management server hosts. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 4.18.2.1, 4.19.0.2 or later, which addresses this issue.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **command injection**
- **impact:** arbitrary code execution and availability and integrity and remote code execution and run arbitrary commands
- **product:** CloudStack
- **component:** cluster service

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is an unauthenticated cluster service port (default 9090) that allows the execution of arbitrary commands. Some of these commands have command injection vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unauthenticated Cluster Service Port:** The cluster service runs on an unauthenticated port (default 9090), allowing anyone who can reach the port to interact with it.
*   **Command Injection:** Some commands executed through the cluster service have command injection vulnerabilities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on hypervisors and CloudStack management server hosts. This RCE is achieved through the cluster service and agents running on the hosts. These agents may run as a privileged user.
*   **Complete Compromise:** Successful exploitation can lead to a complete compromise of the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the CloudStack managed infrastructure.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker must have network access to the unauthenticated cluster service port (default 9090).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Reachability:** The attacker needs to be able to reach the cluster service port (default 9090), typically within the management network.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability allows for remote command execution on both the CloudStack management server and managed hypervisor hosts.
*   The vulnerability exists because the cluster service port does not require authentication and because some of the commands sent to this port are vulnerable to command injection attacks.
*   The provided content also mentions CVE-2024-39864.
*   The vulnerability affects Apache CloudStack versions 4.0.0 through 4.18.2.0 and 4.19.0.0 through 4.19.0.1.
*   The advisory recommends upgrading to versions 4.18.2.1 or 4.19.0.2 or later.
*   If upgrading is not possible, restricting access to the cluster service port (default 9090) to only peer CloudStack management server hosts is recommended. Also restrict network access on CloudStack management hosts to essential ports.
