CWE-352 captures the overall attack vector, while underlying issues like missing nonce validation contribute to its success. There are no direct parent-child relationships used, but the selection of CWE-352 as a compound weakness acknowledges that it's comprised of multiple contributing factors.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    cwe1021[\"CWE-1021: Improper Restriction of Rendered UI Layers or Frames\"]\n    \n    cwe352 -->|RELATED| cwe1021\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe352 primary\n    class cwe1021 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing or incorrect nonce validation** (identified root cause), leading to the possibility of a forged request.
