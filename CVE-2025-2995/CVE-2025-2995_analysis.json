While CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) is a related Class-level CWE, CWE-266 provides a more specific description of the root cause: an incorrect assignment of privileges. There are no strong parent-child or chain relationships evident in this specific vulnerability description to suggest a different or more complex mapping.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe266[\"CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe266 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe266 primary\n    class cwe285 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper access controls** due to **incorrect privilege assignment** (CWE-266). The chain ends with unauthorized access to the system's web management interface.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states \"**improper access controls**\" as the root cause. The Retriever Results list CWE-266 (Incorrect Privilege Assignment) and CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) as potential candidates. Given that the root cause is specifically related to privilege assignment, CWE-266 is the most appropriate choice. CWE-285 is a broader, class-level CWE, making CWE-266 the more specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability. The description lacks information to support other CWEs. Therefore, the assessment relies primarily on the explicit statement of **improper access controls** due to **incorrect privilege assignment** in the vulnerability description.\n\nRelevant CWE

        "extended_description": "\n\nThis weakness can lead to a vulnerability in environments in which the attacker does not have direct access to the operating system, such as in web applications. Alternately, if the weakness occurs in a privileged program, it could allow the attacker to specify commands that normally would not be accessible, or to call alternate commands with privileges that the attacker does not have. The problem is exacerbated if the compromised process does not follow the principle of least privilege, because the attacker-controlled commands may run with special system privileges that increases the amount of damage.\n\n\nThere are at least two subtypes of OS command injection:\n\n\n  - The application intends to execute a single, fixed program that is under its own control. It intends to use externally-supplied inputs as arguments to that program. For example, the program might use system(\"nslookup [HOSTNAME]\") to run nslookup and allow the user to supply a HOSTNAME, which is used as an argument. Attackers cannot prevent nslookup from executing. However, if the program does not remove command separators from the HOSTNAME argument, attackers could place the separators into the arguments, which allows them to execute their own program after nslookup has finished executing.\n\n  - The application accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run, as well as which commands to use. The application simply redirects this entire command to the operating system. For example, the program might use \"exec([COMMAND])\" to execute the [COMMAND] that was supplied by the user. If the COMMAND is under attacker control, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or programs. If the command is being executed using functions like exec() and CreateProcess(), the attacker might not be able to combine multiple commands together in the same line.\n\nFrom a weakness standpoint, these variants represent distinct programmer errors. In the first variant, the programmer clearly intends that input from untrusted parties will be part of the arguments in the command to be executed. In the second variant, the programmer does not intend for the command to be accessible to any untrusted party, but the programmer probably has not accounted for alternate ways in which malicious attackers can provide input.",
