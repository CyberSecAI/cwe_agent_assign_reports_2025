# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-23814

## Vulnerability Description
The integrated ICMP service of the network stack of affected devices can be forced to exhaust its available memory resources when receiving specially crafted messages targeting IP fragment re-assembly. This could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to cause a temporary denial of service condition of the ICMP service, other communication services are not affected. Affected devices will resume normal operation after the attack terminates.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** denial of service condition and temporary denial of service
- **vector:** specially crafted messages
- **attacker:** unauthenticated remote attacker

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
```
- Root cause of vulnerability:
  - The integrated ICMP service of the network stack of affected devices can be forced to exhaust its available memory resources when receiving specially crafted messages targeting IP fragment re-assembly.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
  - Denial of service vulnerability.
- Impact of exploitation:
  - A successful attack will impact the availability of ICMP services on affected products for a limited time before it restores itself after the attack ceases.
- Attack vectors:
  - Remote attackers.
  - Specially crafted ICMP packets.
- Required attacker capabilities/position:
  - Unauthenticated remote attacker.
- Mitigation or fix:
  - Update to newer versions.
  - Implement packet filtering rules at network perimeter devices (firewalls, routers, IDS/IPS) to block ICMP messages with large payloads if viable in your environment.
