The attack can lead to Stored XSS (CWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')]).

An attacker exploits this CSRF to inject malicious input, leading to Stored XSS (CWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')]).

The vulnerability leads to Stored XSS, making it a secondary concern in the context of the primary **weakness**.
