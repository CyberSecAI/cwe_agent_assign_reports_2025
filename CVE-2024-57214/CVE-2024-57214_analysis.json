CWE-78 is a specific type of command injection that occurs at the operating system level, while CWE-77 is a more general class of command injection. Given the description explicitly mentions \"command injection\" without further details, I initially considered CWE-77. However, since OS command injection is a common and well-defined type of command injection, and given the device context (TOTOLINK A6000R), it is more likely that the injection occurs at the OS level. Therefore, I selected the more specific CWE-78.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')\"]\n    \n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe77 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper neutralization** of special elements in the `devname` parameter within the `reset_wifi` function. This leads to **command injection**, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states a **command injection** vulnerability. The retriever results also strongly suggest CWE-77 and CWE-78. Given that the vulnerability is in a network device, it's highly probable that the **command injection** occurs at the OS level. Therefore, I selected CWE-78 as the primary CWE, representing the specific type of **command injection** vulnerability. CWE-77 is considered as a secondary candidate to cover the general case of command injection. My decision is based on the vulnerability description and the common context of such vulnerabilities in network devices.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following

of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA stack-based buffer overflow condition is a condition where the buffer being overwritten is allocated on the stack (i.e., is a local variable or,
