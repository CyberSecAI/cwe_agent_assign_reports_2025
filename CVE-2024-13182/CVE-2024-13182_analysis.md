# Analysis for CVE-2024-13182

# Summary

| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-288 | Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE. The application has a path (wp_dp_parse_request function) that bypasses authentication |
| CWE-303 | Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary candidate. The authentication algorithm is **incorrectly implemented**, allowing the bypass. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship is that CWE-288 is a type of Authentication Bypass, which can be caused by various factors. In this case, the **incorrect authentication** mechanism (CWE-303) allows the **Authentication Bypass** (CWE-288).

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with an **incorrect implementation of the authentication algorithm** (CWE-303), which leads to an **authentication bypass** (CWE-288), ultimately allowing unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user.
  - Root Cause: **Incorrect Authentication** (CWE-303)
  - Weakness: **Authentication Bypass** (CWE-288)
  - Impact: Unauthenticated user login as any existing user.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment identified the vulnerability as an **Authentication Bypass** due to **incorrect authentication**. This is supported by the vulnerability description and the identified key phrases. The retriever results also point towards authentication-related CWEs.

The primary CWE is CWE-288 (Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel) because the vulnerability allows bypassing the intended authentication mechanism through the `wp_dp_parse_request` function. The **root cause** for this bypass is the **incorrect implementation of the authentication** algorithm which can be represented by CWE-303. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator.

The selection of CWE-288 is at the Base level of abstraction, which is appropriate for this vulnerability. The relationship analysis shows that CWE-303 contributes to CWE-288.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product requires authentication, but the product has an alternate path or channel that does not require authentication.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product makes files or directories accessible to unauthorized actors, even though they should not be.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-178: Improper Handling of Case Sensitivity
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly account for differences in case sensitivity when accessing or determining the properties of a resource, leading to inconsistent results.
