  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ext4 fix **i_data_sem unlock order in ext4_ind_migrate()** Fuzzing reports a possible **deadlock** in jbd2_log_wait_commit. This issue is triggered when an EXT4_IOC_MIGRATE ioctl is set to require synchronous updates because the file descriptor is opened with O_SYNC. This can lead to the jbd2_journal_stop() function calling jbd2_might_wait_for_commit(), potentially causing a **deadlock** if the EXT4_IOC_MIGRATE call races with a write(2) system call. This problem only arises when CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING is enabled. In this case, the jbd2_might_wait_for_commit macro locks jbd2_handle in the jbd2_journal_stop function while i_data_sem is locked. This triggers lockdep because the jbd2_journal_start function might also lock the same jbd2_handle simultaneously. Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with syzkaller. Rule add",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe root cause is a locking order issue in the `ext4_ind_migrate` function of the ext4 filesystem driver. Specifically, the `i_data_sem` semaphore was being unlocked *after* `ext4_journal_stop`, which could lead to a deadlock. This deadlock occurs when the `EXT4_IOC_MIGRATE` ioctl, requiring synchronous updates due to a file being opened with O_SYNC, races with a `write(2)` syscall.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- **Deadlock:** The primary vulnerability is a potential deadlock. When `CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING` is enabled, the `jbd2_might_wait_for_commit` macro locks the `jbd2_handle` in the `jbd2_journal_stop` function while `i_data_sem` is already locked. The `jbd2_journal_start` function might attempt to lock the same `jbd2_handle` leading to a deadlock.\n- **Incorrect Locking Order:** The incorrect unlock order of `i_data_sem` is the direct cause of the deadlock.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- **System Hang:** The deadlock can cause the system to become unresponsive, requiring a reboot.\n- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The system hang effectively results in a denial of service.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- **EXT4_IOC_MIGRATE ioctl:** The vulnerability is triggered by using the `EXT4_IOC_MIGRATE` ioctl on a file opened with `O_SYNC`.\n- **Race Condition:** The deadlock requires a race condition between the `EXT4_IOC_MIGRATE` call and a `write(2)` system call.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system and the ability to open a file with the `O_SYNC` flag and trigger the `EXT4_IOC_MIGRATE` ioctl, as well as make write system calls to induce the race.\n- **CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING:** The vulnerability is only triggered if the `CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING` kernel configuration option is enabled.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n- The vulnerability was found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) using syzkaller.\n- The fix involves changing the unlock order, specifically moving `up_write(&EXT4_I(inode)->i_data_sem);` to after `ext4_journal_stop(handle);` in some patches. Other patches replace the unlock of `i_data_sem` with  `percpu_up_write(&sbi->s_writepages_rwsem);` or `ext4_writepages_up_write(inode->i_sb, alloc_ctx);` after `ext4_journal_stop(handle)`.\n- Several different patches were applied to fix this vulnerability, with different approaches taken in various kernel versions. These patches appear to have the same end goal but utilize different mechanisms to address the locking issue.",

The **improper resource locking** can be viewed as a specific instance of **concurrent execution with improper synchronization** (CWE-362), often referred to as a race condition. **Improper locking** (CWE-667) is a broader category that encompasses the root cause.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe833[\"CWE-833: Deadlock\"]\n    cwe413[\"CWE-413: Improper Resource Locking\"]\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    cwe667[\"CWE-667: Improper Locking\"]\n\n    cwe833 -->|CAUSED_BY| cwe413\n    cwe413 -->|CHILDOF| cwe667\n    cwe362 -->|CHILDOF| cwe667\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe833 primary\n    class cwe413,cwe362,cwe667 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper locking order** within the `ext4_ind_migrate()` function. This leads to a race condition where the `EXT4_IOC_MIGRATE` ioctl and a `write(2)` system call contend for the same resources. The race condition, in turn, results in a **deadlock**, causing a system hang and denial of service.\n\nImproper Locking Order -> Race Condition -> Deadlock -> System Hang (DoS)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-833 (**Deadlock**), as the vulnerability description explicitly states a potential **deadlock** in `jbd2_log_wait_commit`. This **deadlock** occurs due to a race condition and **improper locking** order, specifically within the `ext4_ind_migrate()` function when the `EXT4_IOC_MIGRATE` ioctl races with a `write(2)` system call.\n\nSupporting evidence:\n- \"Fuzzing reports a possible **deadlock** in jbd2_log_wait_commit.\"\n- \"This issue is triggered when an EXT4_IOC_MIGRATE ioctl is set to require synchronous updates because the file descriptor is opened with O_SYNC.\"\n- \"This can lead to the jbd2_journal_stop() function calling jbd2_might_wait_for_commit(), potentially causing a **deadlock** if the EXT4_IOC_MIGRATE call races with a write(2) system call.\"\n\nCWE-413 (**Improper Resource Locking**) is also a relevant CWE, as the root cause of the **deadlock** is an **incorrect locking order** in the `ext4_ind_migrate()` function.\n\nCWE-362 (**Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')**) is considered because the **deadlock** is triggered by a race condition between the `EXT4_IOC_MIGRATE` ioctl and the `write(2)` system call.\n\nCWE-667 (**Improper Locking**) is also considered as a more general description of the **locking** issue but is not as specific as CWE-413 or CWE-833.\n\nI am confident in this assessment because of the explicit mention of a **deadlock** and supporting evidence of the **improper locking** conditions that trigger it.
