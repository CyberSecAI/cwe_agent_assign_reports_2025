# Retrieval Query for CVE-2024-50006

## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ext4 fix **i_data_sem unlock order in ext4_ind_migrate()** Fuzzing reports a possible **deadlock** in jbd2_log_wait_commit. This issue is triggered when an EXT4_IOC_MIGRATE ioctl is set to require synchronous updates because the file descriptor is opened with O_SYNC. This can lead to the jbd2_journal_stop() function calling jbd2_might_wait_for_commit(), potentially causing a **deadlock** if the EXT4_IOC_MIGRATE call races with a write(2) system call. This problem only arises when CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING is enabled. In this case, the jbd2_might_wait_for_commit macro locks jbd2_handle in the jbd2_journal_stop function while i_data_sem is locked. This triggers lockdep because the jbd2_journal_start function might also lock the same jbd2_handle simultaneously. Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with syzkaller. Rule add

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **i_data_sem unlock order in ext4_ind_migrate()**
- **weakness:** **deadlock**
- **product:** Linux kernel
- **component:** ext4

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a locking order issue in the `ext4_ind_migrate` function of the ext4 filesystem driver. Specifically, the `i_data_sem` semaphore was being unlocked *after* `ext4_journal_stop`, which could lead to a deadlock. This deadlock occurs when the `EXT4_IOC_MIGRATE` ioctl, requiring synchronous updates due to a file being opened with O_SYNC, races with a `write(2)` syscall.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Deadlock:** The primary vulnerability is a potential deadlock. When `CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING` is enabled, the `jbd2_might_wait_for_commit` macro locks the `jbd2_handle` in the `jbd2_journal_stop` function while `i_data_sem` is already locked. The `jbd2_journal_start` function might attempt to lock the same `jbd2_handle` leading to a deadlock.
- **Incorrect Locking Order:** The incorrect unlock order of `i_data_sem` is the direct cause of the deadlock.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **System Hang:** The deadlock can cause the system to become unresponsive, requiring a reboot.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The system hang effectively results in a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- **EXT4_IOC_MIGRATE ioctl:** The vulnerability is triggered by using the `EXT4_IOC_MIGRATE` ioctl on a file opened with `O_SYNC`.
- **Race Condition:** The deadlock requires a race condition between the `EXT4_IOC_MIGRATE` call and a `write(2)` system call.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system and the ability to open a file with the `O_SYNC` flag and trigger the `EXT4_IOC_MIGRATE` ioctl, as well as make write system calls to induce the race.
- **CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING:** The vulnerability is only triggered if the `CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING` kernel configuration option is enabled.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) using syzkaller.
- The fix involves changing the unlock order, specifically moving `up_write(&EXT4_I(inode)->i_data_sem);` to after `ext4_journal_stop(handle);` in some patches. Other patches replace the unlock of `i_data_sem` with  `percpu_up_write(&sbi->s_writepages_rwsem);` or `ext4_writepages_up_write(inode->i_sb, alloc_ctx);` after `ext4_journal_stop(handle)`.
- Several different patches were applied to fix this vulnerability, with different approaches taken in various kernel versions. These patches appear to have the same end goal but utilize different mechanisms to address the locking issue.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-667: Improper Locking
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.

### Extended Description


Locking is a type of synchronization behavior that ensures that multiple independently-operating processes or threads do not interfere with each other when accessing the same resource. All processes/threads are expected to follow the same steps for locking. If these steps are not followed precisely - or if no locking is done at all - then another process/thread could modify the shared resource in a way that is not visible or predictable to the original process. This can lead to data or memory corruption, denial of service, etc.

### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** Deeper research is necessary for synchronization and related mechanisms, including locks, mutexes, semaphores, and other mechanisms. Multiple entries are dependent on this research, which includes relationships to concurrency, race conditions, reentrant functions, etc. CWE-662 and its children - including CWE-667, CWE-820, CWE-821, and others - may need to be modified significantly, along with their relationships.

- **CVE-2009-1961:** OS deadlock involving 3 separate functions




## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.

### Extended Description


A race condition occurs within concurrent environments, and it is effectively a property of a code sequence. Depending on the context, a code sequence may be in the form of a function call, a small number of instructions, a series of program invocations, etc.


A race condition violates these properties, which are closely related:


  - Exclusivity - the code sequence is given exclusive access to the shared resource, i.e., no other code sequence can modify properties of the shared resource before the original sequence has completed execution.

  - Atomicity - the code sequence is behaviorally atomic, i.e., no other thread or process can concurrently execute the same sequence of instructions (or a subset) against the same resource.

A race condition exists when an "interfering code sequence" can still access the shared resource, violating exclusivity.

The interfering code sequence could be "trusted" or "untrusted." A trusted interfering code sequence occurs within the product; it cannot be modified by the attacker, and it can only be invoked indirectly. An untrusted interfering code sequence can be authored directly by the attacker, and typically it is external to the vulnerable product.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** The relationship between race conditions and synchronization problems (CWE-662) needs to be further developed. They are not necessarily two perspectives of the same core concept, since synchronization is only one technique for avoiding race conditions, and synchronization can be used for other purposes besides race condition prevention.

**[Research Gap]** Race conditions in web applications are under-studied and probably under-reported. However, in 2008 there has been growing interest in this area.

**[Research Gap]** Much of the focus of race condition research has been in Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) variants (CWE-367), but many race conditions are related to synchronization problems that do not necessarily require a time-of-check.

**[Research Gap]** From a classification/taxonomy perspective, the relationships between concurrency and program state need closer investigation and may be useful in organizing related issues.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-29527:** Go application for cloud management creates a world-writable sudoers file that allows local attackers to inject sudo rules and escalate privileges to root by winning a race condition.
- **CVE-2021-1782:** Chain: improper locking (CWE-667) leads to race condition (CWE-362), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2021-0920:** Chain: mobile platform race condition (CWE-362) leading to use-after-free (CWE-416), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.




## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
AuthZ: "AuthZ" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authorization" within the web application security community. It is distinct from "AuthN" (or, sometimes, "AuthC") which is an abbreviation of "authentication." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.

### Additional Notes
**[Terminology]** 

Assuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-39155:** Chain: A microservice integration and management platform compares the hostname in the HTTP Host header in a case-sensitive way (CWE-178, CWE-1289), allowing bypass of the authorization policy (CWE-863) using a hostname with mixed case or other variations.
- **CVE-2019-15900:** Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).
- **CVE-2009-2213:** Gateway uses default "Allow" configuration for its authorization settings.

- **CVE-2022-29952:** Condition Monitor firmware uses a protocol that does not require authentication.




## CWE-413: Improper Resource Locking
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not lock or does not correctly lock a resource when the product must have exclusive access to the resource.

### Extended Description
When a resource is not properly locked, an attacker could modify the resource while it is being operated on by the product. This might violate the product's assumption that the resource will not change, potentially leading to unexpected behaviors.

### Alternative Terms
None

- **CVE-2005-0772:** packet with invalid error status value triggers NULL dereference




## CWE-909: Missing Initialization of Resource
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product does not initialize a critical resource.

### Extended Description
Many resources require initialization before they can be properly used. If a resource is not initialized, it could contain unpredictable or expired data, or it could be initialized to defaults that are invalid. This can have security implications when the resource is expected to have certain properties or values.

- **CVE-2005-1036:** Chain: Bypass of access restrictions due to improper authorization (CWE-862) of a user results from an improperly initialized (CWE-909) I/O permission bitmap




## CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product allocates a reusable resource or group of resources on behalf of an actor without imposing any restrictions on the size or number of resources that can be allocated, in violation of the intended security policy for that actor.

### Extended Description


Code frequently has to work with limited resources, so programmers must be careful to ensure that resources are not consumed too quickly, or too easily. Without use of quotas, resource limits, or other protection mechanisms, it can be easy for an attacker to consume many resources by rapidly making many requests, or causing larger resources to be used than is needed. When too many resources are allocated, or if a single resource is too large, then it can prevent the code from working correctly, possibly leading to a denial of service.


### Alternative Terms

**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This entry is different from uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400) in that there are other weaknesses that are related to inability to control resource consumption, such as holding on to a resource too long after use, or not correctly keeping track of active resources so that they can be managed and released when they are finished (CWE-771).

**[Theoretical]** Vulnerability theory is largely about how behaviors and resources interact. "Resource exhaustion" can be regarded as either a consequence or an attack, depending on the perspective. This entry is an attempt to reflect one of the underlying weaknesses that enable these attacks (or consequences) to take place.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).
- **CVE-2009-4017:** Language interpreter does not restrict the number of temporary files being created when handling a MIME request with a large number of parts..
- **CVE-2009-2726:** Driver does not use a maximum width when invoking sscanf style functions, causing stack consumption.




## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check. This can cause the product to perform invalid actions when the resource is in an unexpected state.

### Extended Description
This weakness can be security-relevant when an attacker can influence the state of the resource between check and use. This can happen with shared resources such as files, memory, or even variables in multithreaded programs.

### Alternative Terms
TOCTTOU: The TOCTTOU acronym expands to "Time Of Check To Time Of Use".
TOCCTOU: The TOCCTOU acronym is most likely a typo of TOCTTOU, but it has been used in some influential documents, so the typo is repeated fairly frequently.

**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** TOCTOU issues do not always involve symlinks, and not every symlink issue is a TOCTOU problem.

**[Research Gap]** Non-symlink TOCTOU issues are not reported frequently, but they are likely to occur in code that attempts to be secure.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2015-1743:** TOCTOU in sandbox process allows installation of untrusted browser add-ons by replacing a file after it has been verified, but before it is executed
- **CVE-2003-0813:** A multi-threaded race condition allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash or reboot) by causing two threads to process the same RPC request, which causes one thread to use memory after it has been freed.
- **CVE-2004-0594:** PHP flaw allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by aborting execution before the initialization of key data structures is complete.
