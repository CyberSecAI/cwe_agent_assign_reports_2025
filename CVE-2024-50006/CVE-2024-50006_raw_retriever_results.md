# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-50006
## Query
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ext4 fix i_data_sem unlock order in ext4_ind_migrate() Fuzzing reports a possible deadlock in jbd2_log_wait_commit. This issue is triggered when an EXT4_IOC_MIGRATE ioctl is set to require synchronous updates because the file descriptor is opened with O_SYNC. This can lead to the jbd2_journal_stop() function calling jbd2_might_wait_for_commit(), potentially causing a deadlock if the EXT4_IOC_MIGRATE call races with a write(2) system call. This problem only arises when CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING is enabled. In this case, the jbd2_might_wait_for_commit macro locks jbd2_handle in the jbd2_journal_stop function while i_data_sem is locked. This triggers lockdep because the jbd2_journal_start function might also lock the same jbd2_handle simultaneously. Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with syzkaller. Rule add
