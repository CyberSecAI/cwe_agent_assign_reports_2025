  "description": "The KiviCare Clinic & Patient Management System (EHR) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the sort[] parameter of the static_data_list AJAX action in all versions up to, and including, 3.6.4 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with doctor/receptionist-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-11730\n\n**Root Cause:**\n- The vulnerability is caused by insufficient input sanitization on the `sort[]` parameter within the `static_data_list` AJAX action. The parameter is not properly escaped before being used in an SQL query, and existing SQL queries lack adequate preparation.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n- **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is an SQL injection vulnerability. The unsanitized `sort[]` parameter allows attackers to inject arbitrary SQL code.\n- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize the `sort[]` parameter before using it in an SQL query.\n- **Lack of Prepared Statements:** The existing SQL query does not use prepared statements, which would prevent SQL injection attacks.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to extract sensitive information from the database by injecting malicious SQL queries.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- The vulnerability is triggered via the `static_data_list` AJAX action.\n- The `sort[]` parameter is the attack vector.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Authenticated Access:** Attackers must be authenticated users with at least doctor/receptionist-level access (or higher) to exploit this vulnerability.\n- **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the WordPress site to send the malicious request.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n- The vulnerability exists in versions of the KiviCare \u2013 Clinic & Patient Management System (EHR) WordPress plugin up to and including 3.6.4.\n- The fix was implemented in version 3.6.5 by utilizing `sanitize_sql_orderby` to sanitize the `field` and `type` values before concatenating them to the `ORDER BY` clause.\n- The Wordfence article mentions that the vulnerability is caused by \"insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.\"",
