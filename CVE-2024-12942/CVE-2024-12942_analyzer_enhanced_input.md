The manipulation of the argument username/password leads to **sql injection**. It is possible to launch the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **sql injection**
- **product:** 1000 Projects Portfolio Management System MCA
- **version:** 1.0
- **component:** /admin/admin_login.php

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-12942 (based on the content provided, although this is not officially confirmed)

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `/admin/admin_login.php` file of the "Portfolio Management System MCA Project using PHP and MySQL."
- The application fails to sanitize or validate user input, specifically the 'username' parameter, before using it in SQL queries.
- Attackers can inject malicious SQL code through this parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the presence of SQL injection due to the lack of input sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Database Access:** Attackers can gain access to the database without proper authorization.
- **Sensitive Data Leakage:** Attackers can extract sensitive data stored in the database.
- **Data Tampering:** Attackers can modify or delete data in the database.
- **System Control:** In severe cases, attackers might be able to gain comprehensive control over the system.
- **Service Interruption:** Attackers might be able to cause denial of service or disrupt the normal functioning of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `username` parameter in the `/admin/admin_login.php` file.
- The attacker crafts malicious SQL queries within the username parameter via a POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable login page (`/admin/admin_login.php`)
- They need knowledge of how to craft SQL injection payloads.
- No prior authentication is needed to exploit the vulnerability, which can be leveraged by an unauthenticated attacker.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided proof of concept (POC) utilizes the `sqlmap` tool to demonstrate the vulnerability.
- Boolean-based blind and time-based blind SQL injection techniques are used.
- The payload demonstrates how an attacker can use SQL syntax to bypass the login mechanism.

**Suggested Fixes:**
- **Prepared Statements/Parameterized Queries:** Use prepared statements or parameterized queries to ensure that user input is treated as data rather than as executable SQL code. This is the most effective countermeasure.
- **Input Validation and Filtering:** Implement strict validation and filtering on all user inputs to ensure that data conforms to the expected format. This includes sanitizing special characters, enforcing length limitations, and checking for valid data types.
- **Regular Security Audits:** Perform regular security audits of the code and system to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

**Additional Notes:**
- The identified vulnerability is in a login page, which makes it a high-risk issue.
- The project is described as "Portfolio Management System MCA Project using PHP and MySQL."
- The vulnerable application is accessible via the URL `http://192.168.75.230:8080/admin/admin_login.php`.

This analysis provides a clear understanding of the SQL injection vulnerability, including its root cause, potential impact, and recommended mitigation strategies.
