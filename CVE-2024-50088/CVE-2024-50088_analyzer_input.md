# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-50088

## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved btrfs fix **uninitialized pointer free** in add_inode_ref() The add_inode_ref() function does not initialize the name struct when it is declared. If any of the following calls to read_one_inode() returns NULL, dir = read_one_inode(root, parent_objectid) if (!dir) { ret = -ENOENT goto out } inode = read_one_inode(root, inode_objectid) if (!inode) { ret = -EIO goto out } then name.name would be freed on out before being initialized. out ... kfree(name.name) This issue was reported by Coverity with CID 1526744.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **uninitialized pointer free**
- **impact:** use-after-free
- **product:** Linux kernel
- **component:** btrfs

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The `add_inode_ref()` function in `fs/btrfs/tree-log.c` declares a `struct fscrypt_str name` without initializing it.
- If either of the calls to `read_one_inode()` fails (returns NULL), the code jumps to the `out` label.
- At the `out` label, `kfree(name.name)` is called, which attempts to free the `name.name` pointer. This pointer is uninitialized because the `name` struct was not initialized.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Use of Uninitialized Memory:** The core vulnerability is the use of an uninitialized `name.name` pointer in a `kfree()` call, which can lead to memory corruption.
- **Incorrect Resource Handling:** The function's logic does not properly handle the case where `read_one_inode()` fails.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Memory Corruption:** Attempting to free uninitialized memory can lead to memory corruption and unpredictable behavior. This could result in a crash, denial of service, or potentially other issues.
- **Potential for Privilege Escalation:** Though not explicitly mentioned, memory corruption vulnerabilities in kernel code can sometimes be leveraged for privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The vulnerability can be triggered whenever the `add_inode_ref()` function is called within the Btrfs filesystem, and conditions cause either of the `read_one_inode()` calls to fail (e.g. due to a corrupted filesystem).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker would need to have the ability to manipulate the Btrfs filesystem in such a way that `read_one_inode()` will fail during the execution of `add_inode_ref()`, which may involve direct filesystem access or trigger specific error conditions.
- The attacker likely needs write access to the filesystem to create such conditions.
