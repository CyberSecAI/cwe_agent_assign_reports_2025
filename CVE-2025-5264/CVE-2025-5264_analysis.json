CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) was also considered due to its high retriever score, although ultimately deemed less directly relevant. The abstraction levels were considered to choose the most appropriate level of granularity.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe116[\"CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    \n    cwe787\n    cwe116\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe116 primary\n    class cwe787 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **insufficient escaping of the newline character**, which leads to potential local code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on the **insufficient escaping of the newline character**, making CWE-116 the most relevant. The retriever results also suggested CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write), but the direct cause is the lack of proper escaping, not necessarily a write beyond buffer boundaries. The decision is strongly based on the evidence provided, which highlights the **insufficient escaping** as the root cause. The graph relationships did not significantly influence the decision, as the primary focus was on accurately representing the root cause. CWE-116 is at the Class level, however, there isn't enough information to select a more specific Base level CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-451: User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe user interface (UI) does not properly represent critical information to the user, allowing the information - or its source - to be obscured or spoofed.
