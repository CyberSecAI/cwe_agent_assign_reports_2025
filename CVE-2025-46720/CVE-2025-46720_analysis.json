  "description": "Keystone is a content management system for Node.js. Prior to version 6.5.0, `{field}.isFilterable` access control can be bypassed in `update` and `delete` mutations by adding additional unique filters. These filters can be used as an oracle to probe the existence or value of otherwise unreadable fields. Specifically, when a mutation includes a `where` clause with multiple unique filters (e.g. `id` and `email`), Keystone will attempt to match records even if filtering by the latter fields would normally be rejected by `field.isFilterable` or `list.defaultIsFilterable`. This can allow malicious actors to infer the presence of a particular field value when a filter is successful in returning a result. This affects any project relying on the default or dynamic `isFilterable` behavior (at the list or field level) to prevent external users from using the filtering of fields as a discovery mechanism. While this access control is respected during `findMany` operations, it was not completely enforced during `update` and `delete` mutations when accepting more than one unique `where` values in filters. This has no impact on projects using `isFilterable false` or `defaultIsFilterable false` for sensitive fields, or for those who have otherwise omitted filtering by these fields from their GraphQL schema. This issue has been patched in `@keystone-6/core` version 6.5.0. To mitigate this issue in older versions where patching is not a viable pathway, set `isFilterable false` statically for relevant fields to prevent filtering by them earlier in the access control pipeline (that is, dont use functions) set `{field}.graphql.omit.read true` for relevant fields, which implicitly removes filtering by these fields from the GraphQL schema and/or deny `update` and `delete` operations for the relevant lists completely.",

  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-46720 Content\n\nThis content **relates** to CVE-2025-46720. It provides significantly more detail than the placeholder CVE description.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe `isFilterable` access control can be bypassed in `update` and `delete` mutations when using multiple unique filters in the `where` clause. Keystone attempts to match records even if filtering by certain fields would normally be rejected by `isFilterable` or `defaultIsFilterable`.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Incomplete enforcement of `isFilterable` access control during `update` and `delete` mutations with multiple unique filters.\n*   Potential for information leakage through filter success/failure as an oracle.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nMalicious actors can infer the presence or value of otherwise unreadable fields by observing the success or failure of filters in `update` and `delete` mutations. This affects projects relying on `isFilterable` to prevent field discovery.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Exploitation occurs through `update` and `delete` mutations with a `where` clause containing multiple unique filters.\n*   Network-based attack vector.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   Low privileges required.\n*   No user interaction required.\n*   Attacker needs to be able to send GraphQL `update` or `delete` mutations.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   Upgrade to `@keystone-6/core` version 6.5.0 or later.\n*   **Workarounds (for older versions):**\n    *   Set `{field}.isFilterable: false` statically for sensitive fields.\n    *   Set `{field}.graphql.omit.read: true` for sensitive fields.\n    *   Deny `update` and `delete` operations for the relevant lists.\n\n**CVSS Score:** 3.1 / 10\n\n**CVSS v3 base metrics:**\n\n*   Attack Vector: Network\n*   Attack Complexity: High\n*   Privileges Required: Low\n*   User Interaction: None\n*   Scope: Unchanged\n*   Confidentiality: Low\n*   Integrity: None\n*   Availability: None\n\n**CVE ID:** CVE-2025-46720\n\n**Credits:**\n\n*   @emmatown (Finder)\n*   @dcousens (Remediation verifier)",

The application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic). |\n| CWE-639 | Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary candidate. The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data. |\n| CWE-200 | Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor | 0.6 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary candidate. The product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-863, which represents an authorization check that is performed incorrectly. CWE-639 is a more specific Base level CWE that describes the authorization bypass through a user-controlled key, which aligns with the vulnerability description. CWE-200 is a Class level CWE that describes the exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized actor, which is the impact of the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n\n    cwe639 -->|CHILDOF| cwe863\n    cwe200 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe863\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe639,cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **incorrect authorization** check (CWE-863). This leads to an **authorization bypass** (CWE-639) by adding additional unique filters. This in turn allows for the **exposure of sensitive information** (CWE-200) when malicious actors can infer the presence or value of otherwise unreadable fields.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment considered the retriever results and the vulnerability description. The primary weakness is the **bypass of Keystone access control by adding additional unique filters**. This maps well to CWE-863, Incorrect Authorization, because the `isFilterable` access control is present but is being bypassed. The vulnerability description indicates that the access control is not correctly enforced during `update` and `delete` mutations when accepting more than one unique `where` values in filters.\n\nCWE-639 is considered as a secondary candidate because it describes the authorization bypass through a user-controlled key, specifically the unique filters added to the `where` clause. This provides a more specific understanding of how the authorization is bypassed.\n\nCWE-200 is included as a tertiary candidate because it describes the impact of the vulnerability, where sensitive information is exposed to unauthorized actors.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the final selection by highlighting the hierarchical relationships between CWE-863 and CWE-639. CWE-639 is a child of CWE-863, providing more specificity.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately represent the weakness and its impact, based on the evidence provided in the vulnerability description and CVE reference links content summary.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
