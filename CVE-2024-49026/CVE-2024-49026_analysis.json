CWE-94 is considered as a secondary candidate due to the \"Remote Code Execution\" impact, which suggests potential code injection. However, without specific details on the **vulnerable mechanism** and **root cause**, a precise CWE assignment is not possible.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cweNVD[\"CWE-NVD-noinfo: NVD Information Unavailable\"]\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cweNVD primary\n    class cwe94 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is incomplete due to the lack of information. The known impact is Remote Code Execution, but the root cause is unknown.\n\n`Unknown Root Cause -> Code Injection (Potential) -> Remote Code Execution`\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment strongly relies on the limited information provided in the vulnerability description, primarily the \"Remote Code Execution\" impact. The retriever results also suggest potential CWEs related to code injection.\n\nThe final decision is based on the absence of specific root cause information. CWE-NVD-noinfo is used to indicate the lack of sufficient details. CWE-94 is retained as a secondary candidate due to the potential for code injection, but this is speculative. More information is needed to confirm the root cause and identify a more precise CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1236: Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product saves user-provided information into a Comma-Separated Value (CSV) file, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as a command when the file is opened by a spreadsheet product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
