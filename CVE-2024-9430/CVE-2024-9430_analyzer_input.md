- **Information Disclosure:** Unauthenticated attackers can download Quote PDF and CSV documents. This may include sensitive information about quotes, customers, or products.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct HTTP Request:** An attacker can craft a malicious HTTP request to trigger the vulnerable code and download the quote documents.
