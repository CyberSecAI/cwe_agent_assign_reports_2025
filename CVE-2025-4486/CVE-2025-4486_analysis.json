  "reference_content": "The content relates to CVE-2025-4486. Here's the extracted information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\n* A SQL injection vulnerability was found in the '/ajax.php?action=delete\\_plan' file of the 'Gym Management System' project. The reason for this issue is that attackers inject malicious code from the parameter 'id' and use it directly in SQL queries without the need for appropriate cleaning or validation.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n* SQL injection\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n* Attackers can exploit this SQL injection vulnerability to achieve unauthorized database access, sensitive data leakage, data tampering, comprehensive system control, and even service interruption.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n* The vulnerability is present in the `/ajax.php?action=delete_plan` file.\n* The 'id' parameter is vulnerable to injection.\n* No login or authorization is required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*  An attacker needs to be able to send a crafted HTTP POST request to `/ajax.php?action=delete_plan` with a malicious 'id' parameter. No authentication is required.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n* Use prepared statements and parameter binding.\n* Input validation and filtering.\n* Minimize database user permissions.\n* Regular security audits.\n\n**Payload Example:**\n\n```\nParameter: id (POST)\n    Type: boolean-based blind\n    Title: Boolean-based blind - Parameter replace (original value)\n    Payload: id=(SELECT (CASE WHEN (1894=1894) THEN 7 ELSE (SELECT 3566 UNION SELECT 7276) END))\n```\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   The affected product is itsourcecode Gym Management System V1.0.\n*   A link to the vulnerable software is provided: <https://itsourcecode.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Gym-Management-System-Project-in-PHP.zip>\n*   The submitter is WangYilin.\n*   SQLMap was used to test the vulnerability.\n*   Screenshots of SQLMap output are included.",

There are no parent-child or chain relationships that are relevant in this case, as the description clearly points to a **SQL Injection** vulnerability. The abstraction level is base which is the optimal level.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe89 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is simple:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')** (CWE-89) due to lack of input validation.\n2.  Impact: Unauthorized database access, sensitive data leakage, data tampering, comprehensive system control, and even service interruption.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, which clearly states that the vulnerability is a **SQL Injection** in the `/ajax.php?action=delete_plan` file due to **manipulation of the argument ID**, leading to **sql injection**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this, stating that the 'id' parameter is vulnerable to injection and that malicious code is injected from the 'id' parameter and used directly in SQL queries without proper cleaning or validation. The suggested mitigations (prepared statements, input validation) are also indicative of a SQL injection vulnerability.\n\nThe retriever results strongly support CWE-89 as the primary CWE, with a score of 1.000.\n\nThe selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly addresses the **root cause** of the vulnerability, which is the **improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL command**.\n\n# Relevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.
