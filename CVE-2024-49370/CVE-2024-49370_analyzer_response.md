# Raw Analyzer Response for CVE-2024-49370

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-256 | Plaintext Storage of a Password | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE - The password is set **without hashing** so it can be read by everyone. |
| CWE-306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE - The function does not properly authenticate the request to change the password. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-256, which directly reflects the vulnerability of storing passwords in plaintext. CWE-306 is a related weakness, as the critical function of changing the password lacks proper authentication, potentially leading to unauthorized password changes and plaintext storage.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with a missing authentication check (CWE-306), leading to the ability to change a password without proper authorization. This results in the new password being stored in plaintext (CWE-256), making it readable by anyone.

## Summary of Analysis
The primary vulnerability is that the password is set **without hashing**, allowing it to be read by everyone. This directly corresponds to CWE-256, Plaintext Storage of a Password. The vulnerability description key phrases and the CVE reference links content summary support this mapping. The selection of CWE-256 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it precisely describes the core issue.

CWE-306, Missing Authentication for Critical Function, is considered as a secondary weakness. While the description doesn't explicitly state a complete lack of authentication, the fact that the password can be changed and stored without hashing suggests a lapse in proper authentication procedures for this critical function.

Other CWEs Considered:

*   CWE-916 (Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort): This was considered but rejected because the password is not hashed at all, rather than being hashed with insufficient computational effort.
*   CWE-287 (Improper Authentication): While related, this is a more general class, and CWE-306 is a more specific base.
*   CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials): This is a broader class, and CWE-256 is a more specific base.
*   CWE-620 (Unverified Password Change): While the password change is unverified, the more direct root cause is the plaintext storage.
Relevant CWE Information:
# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-620: Unverified Password Change
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
When setting a new password for a user, the product does not require knowledge of the original password, or using another form of authentication.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-836: Use of Password Hash Instead of Password for Authentication
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product records password hashes in a data store, receives a hash of a password from a client, and compares the supplied hash to the hash obtained from the data store.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:

## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
