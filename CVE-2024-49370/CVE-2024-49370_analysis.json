  "description": "Pimcore is an open source data and experience management platform. When a PortalUserObject is connected to a PimcoreUser and Use Pimcore Backend Password is set to true, the change password function in Portal Profile sets the new password. Prior to Pimcore portal engine versions 4.1.7 and 3.1.16, the password is then set without hashing so it can be read by everyone. Everyone who combines PortalUser to PimcoreUsers and change passwords via profile settings could be affected. Versions 4.1.7 and 3.1.16 of the Pimcore portal engine fix the issue.",

CWE-306 is a related weakness, as the critical function of changing the password lacks proper authentication, potentially leading to unauthorized password changes and plaintext storage.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe256[\"CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n\n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe256 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe306 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe256\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe256 primary\n    class cwe306 secondary\n    class cwe287,cwe201 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a missing authentication check (CWE-306), leading to the ability to change a password without proper authorization. This results in the new password being stored in plaintext (CWE-256), making it readable by anyone.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary vulnerability is that the password is set **without hashing**, allowing it to be read by everyone. This directly corresponds to CWE-256, Plaintext Storage of a Password. The vulnerability description key phrases and the CVE reference links content summary support this mapping. The selection of CWE-256 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it precisely describes the core issue.\n\nCWE-306, Missing Authentication for Critical Function, is considered as a secondary weakness. While the description doesn't explicitly state a complete lack of authentication, the fact that the password can be changed and stored without hashing suggests a lapse in proper authentication procedures for this critical function.\n\nOther CWEs Considered:\n\n*   CWE-916 (Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort): This was considered but rejected because the password is not hashed at all, rather than being hashed with insufficient computational effort.\n*   CWE-287 (Improper Authentication): While related, this is a more general class, and CWE-306 is a more specific base.\n*   CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials): This is a broader class, and CWE-256 is a more specific base.\n*   CWE-620 (Unverified Password Change): While the password change is unverified, the more direct root cause is the plaintext storage.\nRelevant CWE Information:\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this
