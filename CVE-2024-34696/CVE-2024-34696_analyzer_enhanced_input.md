## Vulnerability Description
GeoServer is an open source server that allows users to share and edit geospatial data. Starting in version 2.10.0 and prior to versions 2.24.4 and 2.25.1, GeoServers Server Status page and REST API lists all environment variables and Java properties to any GeoServer user with administrative rights as part of those modules status message. These variables/properties can also contain sensitive information, such as database passwords or API keys/tokens. Additionally, many community-developed GeoServer container images `export` other credentials from their start-up scripts as environment variables to the GeoServer (`java`) process. The precise scope of the issue depends on which container image is used and how it is configured. The `about status` API endpoint which powers the Server Status page is only available to administrators.Depending on the operating environment, administrators might have legitimate access to credentials in other ways, but this issue defeats more sophisticated controls (like break-glass access to secrets or role accounts).By default, GeoServer only allows same-origin authenticated API access. This limits the scope for a third-party attacker to use an administrators credentials to gain access to credentials. The researchers who found the vulnerability were unable to determine any other conditions under which the GeoServer REST API may be available more broadly. Users should update container images to use GeoServer 2.24.4 or 2.25.1 to get the bug fix. As

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **information disclosure**
- **attacker:** GeoServer user with administrative rights
- **product:** GeoServer
- **version:** 2.10.0 to 2.24.3 and prior to 2.25.1
- **component:** Server Status page and REST API

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability:** GeoServer's Server Status page and REST API expose all environment variables and Java properties to any authenticated administrator user.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information Disclosure. The system discloses sensitive information, such as database passwords, API keys, tokens, and other secrets through environment variables and Java properties. This data is exposed via the status page and API endpoint.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with administrative privileges can access sensitive credentials, potentially leading to unauthorized access to data stores, other systems, or services integrated with GeoServer.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is accessible via the GeoServer web interface through the "Server Status" page and REST API endpoint `/geoserver/rest/about/status`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrative rights within the GeoServer application. While default configurations limit API access to the same origin, it could be exploited via XSS if an attacker gains admin credentials.
