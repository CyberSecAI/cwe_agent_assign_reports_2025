  "description": "GeoServer is an open source server that allows users to share and edit geospatial data. Starting in version 2.10.0 and prior to versions 2.24.4 and 2.25.1, GeoServers Server Status page and REST API lists all environment variables and Java properties to any GeoServer user with administrative rights as part of those modules status message. These variables/properties can also contain sensitive information, such as database passwords or API keys/tokens. Additionally, many community-developed GeoServer container images `export` other credentials from their start-up scripts as environment variables to the GeoServer (`java`) process. The precise scope of the issue depends on which container image is used and how it is configured. The `about status` API endpoint which powers the Server Status page is only available to administrators.Depending on the operating environment, administrators might have legitimate access to credentials in other ways, but this issue defeats more sophisticated controls (like break-glass access to secrets or role accounts).By default, GeoServer only allows same-origin authenticated API access. This limits the scope for a third-party attacker to use an administrators credentials to gain access to credentials. The researchers who found the vulnerability were unable to determine any other conditions under which the GeoServer REST API may be available more broadly. Users should update container images to use GeoServer 2.24.4 or 2.25.1 to get the bug fix. As",

The system discloses sensitive information, such as database passwords, API keys, tokens, and other secrets through environment variables and Java properties. This data is exposed via the status page and API endpoint.\n- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with administrative privileges can access sensitive credentials, potentially leading to unauthorized access to data stores, other systems, or services integrated with GeoServer.\n- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is accessible via the GeoServer web interface through the \"Server Status\" page and REST API endpoint `/geoserver/rest/about/status`.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrative rights within the GeoServer application. While default configurations limit API access to the same origin, it could be exploited via XSS if an attacker gains admin credentials.\n\nThe provided document gives more detail than the CVE description, explaining the context of the vulnerability, the specific sensitive information being exposed, and the mitigation strategies.",

CWE-200 is a Class-level CWE that represents the general case of sensitive information exposure.

The vulnerability description states: \"GeoServers Server Status page and REST API lists all environment variables and Java properties to any GeoServer user with administrative rights...These variables/properties can also contain sensitive information, such as database passwords or API keys/tokens.\" This directly maps to CWE-526 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in an Environment Variable). This is then exposed via the status page to administrators, hence CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor).\n\nCWE-200 is a class-level CWE and discouraged as a primary mapping. However, in this case, it accurately describes the impact. I am selecting CWE-526 as primary because it's a more specific variant that details the root cause **weakness**, while CWE-200 describes the resulting **information disclosure**.\n\nOther CWEs considered but not used:\n\n*   CWE-532 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File): While the description mentions sensitive information being exposed, it is not explicitly in log files, but rather via the Server Status page and REST API.\n*   CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data): Similar to CWE-532, this is not the primary method of exposure. The information is not necessarily being \"sent\" but rather displayed.\n*   CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere): This is too high-level and CWE-526 is more specific to the root cause.\n*   CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function): Authentication *is* required (admin rights), so this doesn't apply.\n* CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization): Authorization is not the root cause.\n* CWE-917 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')): Does not apply to this case.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-200 is commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error. As of CWE 4.9, over 400 CWE entries can lead to a loss of confidentiality. Other options are often available.

It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.\n\n\n\n## CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product generates an error message that includes sensitive information about its environment, users, or associated data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-",
