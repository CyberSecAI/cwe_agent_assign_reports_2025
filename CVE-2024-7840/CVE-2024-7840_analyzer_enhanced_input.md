### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **command injection**
- **product:** Telerik Reporting
- **version:** prior to 2024 Q3 (2024.3.924)

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper neutralization of special elements used in a command, specifically within hyperlinks in the desktop Report Viewers and Standalone Report Designer applications. These hyperlinks were allowed to contain custom commands.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Command Injection (CWE-77). The application fails to sanitize or validate user-provided input in hyperlinks which could lead to execution of arbitrary commands.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject arbitrary commands through specially crafted hyperlinks. This could lead to remote code execution and full system compromise.
- **Attack vectors**: Attackers would need to craft malicious hyperlinks and present them to a user through a Telerik Reporting desktop application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Attackers would need to have the ability to create or modify reports that include malicious hyperlinks. They need to target users of vulnerable versions of Telerik Reporting.
