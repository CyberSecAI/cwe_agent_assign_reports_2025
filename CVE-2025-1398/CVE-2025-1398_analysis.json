CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection') is a base-level CWE, related to the code injection aspect of the vulnerability but less specific than CWE-277. There are no direct parent-child relationships apparent from the retriever results that strongly influence the selection.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe277[\"CWE-277: Insecure Inherited Permissions\"]\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe277 primary\n    class cwe94 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **Insecure Inherited Permissions** (CWE-277). This leads to the ability to **bypass Transparency, Consent, and Control (TCC) via code injection**. The code injection aspect can be classified as CWE-94. The root cause is the insecure permissions allowing the code injection to occur.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified the **bypass Transparency, Consent, and Control (TCC) via code injection** as the main weakness. The retriever results suggested CWE-277 Insecure Inherited Permissions and CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection').\n\nThe vulnerability description states that the application \"explicitly declared unnecessary macOS entitlements which allows an attacker with remote access to **bypass Transparency, Consent, and Control (TCC) via code injection**\". This indicates that the declared entitlements, which can be seen as insecure inherited permissions, are the root cause, making CWE-277 the primary CWE. The code injection is a consequence enabled by the insecure permissions, thus CWE-94 is a secondary concern.\n\nThe final selection is based on the evidence that the unnecessary entitlements are the root cause that allows code injection to bypass TCC. CWE-277 is chosen as the primary CWE because it directly addresses the insecure permissions aspect, while CWE-94 is a secondary CWE that addresses the code injection aspect.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-451: User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe user interface (UI) does not properly represent critical information to the user, allowing the information - or its source - to be obscured or spoofed.
