  "description": "A vulnerability in Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) polling for Cisco Secure Email and Web Manager, Cisco Secure Email Gateway, and Cisco Secure Web Appliance could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to obtain confidential information about the underlying operating system. This vulnerability exists because the **appliances do not protect confidential information at rest in response to SNMP poll requests**. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted SNMP poll request to the affected appliance. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to discover confidential information that should be restricted. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have the configured SNMP credentials.",

CWE-497 is a more specific child of CWE-200, focusing on the exposure of system-level information. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"confidential information about the underlying operating system,\" which aligns well with the scope of CWE-497. Choosing CWE-497 provides a more granular classification than the broader CWE-200.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe497[\"CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n\n    cwe497 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe497 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **appliances not protecting confidential information at rest in response to SNMP poll requests**. This **weakness** leads to the exposure of sensitive system information when an attacker sends a crafted SNMP poll request, ultimately resulting in the attacker obtaining confidential information about the underlying operating system.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability, which is that the **appliances do not protect confidential information at rest**. The retriever results suggested several CWEs, including CWE-200, CWE-497, and CWE-798. However, based on the vulnerability description and the CVE reference link content summary, CWE-497 (Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere) is the most appropriate because it specifically addresses the exposure of system-level information, which aligns with the vulnerability's impact. CWE-200 is a broader category and is discouraged as per mapping guidance for being too general. CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials) is not applicable as the vulnerability does not involve the use of hard-coded credentials. The final selection is based on the evidence provided, the relationship between CWEs, and the mapping guidance. The chosen CWE is at the optimal level of specificity, providing a clear and accurate representation of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Technical Explanation:**\nCWE-497 (Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere) is selected as the primary CWE because the vulnerability description states that the **appliances do not protect confidential information at rest in response to SNMP poll requests**, leading to the exposure of confidential information about the underlying operating system. This aligns directly with the CWE-497 description, which focuses on preventing unauthorized access to sensitive system-level information. The impact is that an attacker can discover restricted confidential information. CWE-497 is a Base level CWE, providing the right level of granularity. The mapping guidance allows for its use.\n\n**CWE-200 Considerations:**\nCWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) was considered but not selected as the primary CWE because it is a broader category. While the vulnerability does involve the exposure of sensitive information, the specific type of information exposed (system-level information) makes CWE-497 a more accurate choice.
