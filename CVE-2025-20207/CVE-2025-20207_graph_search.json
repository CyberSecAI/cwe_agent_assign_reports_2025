This vulnerability exists because the appliances do not protect confidential information at rest in response to SNMP poll requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted SNMP poll request to the affected appliance. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to discover confidential information that should be restricted. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have the configured SNMP credentials. Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-306 CWE-213 CWE-285 CWE-798 CWE-1392 CWE-522 CWE-200 CWE-497",
