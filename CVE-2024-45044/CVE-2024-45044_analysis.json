  "description": "Bareos is open source software for backup, archiving, and recovery of data for operating systems. When a command ACL is in place and a user executes a command in bconsole using an abbreviation (i.e. w for whoami) the ACL check did not apply to the full form (i.e. whoami) but to the abbreviated form (i.e. w). If the command ACL is configured with negative ACL that should forbid using the whoami command, you could still use w or who as a command successfully. Fixes for the problem are shipped in Bareos versions 23.0.4, 22.1.6 and 21.1.11. If only positive command ACLs are used without any negation, the problem does not occur.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2024-45044:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from how Bareos Director's command Access Control Lists (ACLs) were processed. When a user entered a command in the `bconsole` using an abbreviation (e.g., \"w\" for \"whoami\"), the ACL check only considered the abbreviated form instead of the full command.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Inconsistent ACL Enforcement:** The core issue is that the ACL check mechanism did not properly normalize or expand abbreviated commands before performing the access control check, thus circumventing negative ACLs.\n*   **Bypass of Negative ACLs:**  Attackers could bypass negative command ACLs by using abbreviations. For example, if the ACL denied \"whoami\", an attacker could execute the command by typing \"w\" or \"who\".\n*   **Profile Overwrite:**  When using negative ACLs (starting with '!'), profiles could overwrite these entries due to the code not distinguishing between negative ACLs and 'not found' scenarios.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Unauthorized Command Execution:** An attacker could execute commands that they were explicitly denied access to through the defined ACLs.\n*   **Potential for Privilege Escalation:** By bypassing command restrictions, an attacker might gain elevated privileges or perform actions they are not intended to.\n*   **Compromised Security:** The vulnerability undermines the intended security controls provided by command ACLs.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Network Access:** Exploitation occurs through the `bconsole`, which is typically accessed over a network.\n*   **Command Abbreviation:** The attacker uses command abbreviations to bypass restrictions.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Access to bconsole:** The attacker must have network access to a Bareos Director's `bconsole` interface.\n*   **Valid User Credentials:** The attacker needs to have valid user credentials that allow them to connect to `bconsole`.\n*   **Awareness of Command Abbreviations:** The attacker must be aware of the command abbreviations to exploit this vulnerability.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n*   The vulnerability was fixed in Bareos versions 23.0.4, 22.1.6, and 21.1.11.\n*   The fix involves checking the full command string against the ACL rather than just the abbreviated input.\n*   The fix also addresses the handling of negative ACLs in profiles by introducing three ACL checking states (positive match, negative match, no match).\n*   The patch also adds the ACL directive `!*all*` to deny all commands, which was previously only achievable through the regex `!.*`.\n*   The CVE description mentions CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation), which aligns with the vulnerability where the input (abbreviated command) was not properly validated/normalized before being checked against the ACLs.\n* The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 score of 8.8, indicating a high severity.",

Additionally, the CANPRECEDE relationships of CWE-184 (Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs) to other command injection CWEs like CWE-78 and CWE-79 were considered. CWE-863 was selected as the primary as it more accurately captured the **incorrect** nature of the authorization check, whereas CWE-285 is more general as it also includes cases where no authorization check is performed.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe184[\"CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\"]\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe184 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe78\n    cwe184 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe79\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe184 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **incorrect** authorization check (CWE-863) due to a failure to normalize command abbreviations against the ACL. This leads to commands being executed that should have been denied. A secondary contributing factor is the **incomplete** list of disallowed inputs (CWE-184) since the ACL mechanism did not account for command abbreviations and negative ACLs.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on command injection CWEs given the description included \"**command injection**\". However, the root cause is not direct injection but rather an **incorrect** authorization check. The ACL check mechanism did not properly normalize or expand abbreviated commands before performing the access control check. The vulnerability allows an authorized user to bypass intended restrictions. CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) is the most appropriate primary CWE as it accurately represents this **incorrect** authorization. CWE-184 (Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs) is a secondary contributing factor because the list of disallowed commands was effectively **incomplete** due to the failure to account for command abbreviations and how negative ACLs were processed.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-88: Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs a string for a command to be executed by a separate component\nin another control sphere, but it does not properly delimit the\nintended arguments, options, or switches within that command string.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
