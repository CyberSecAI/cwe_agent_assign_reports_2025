## Vulnerability Description
Bareos is open source software for backup, archiving, and recovery of data for operating systems. When a command ACL is in place and a user executes a command in bconsole using an abbreviation (i.e. w for whoami) the ACL check did not apply to the full form (i.e. whoami) but to the abbreviated form (i.e. w). If the command ACL is configured with negative ACL that should forbid using the whoami command, you could still use w or who as a command successfully. Fixes for the problem are shipped in Bareos versions 23.0.4, 22.1.6 and 21.1.11. If only positive command ACLs are used without any negation, the problem does not occur.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **product:** Bareos
- **version:** prior to 23.0.4, 22.1.6 and 21.1.11
- **component:** bconsole

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2024-45044:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from how Bareos Director's command Access Control Lists (ACLs) were processed. When a user entered a command in the `bconsole` using an abbreviation (e.g., "w" for "whoami"), the ACL check only considered the abbreviated form instead of the full command.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inconsistent ACL Enforcement:** The core issue is that the ACL check mechanism did not properly normalize or expand abbreviated commands before performing the access control check, thus circumventing negative ACLs.
*   **Bypass of Negative ACLs:**  Attackers could bypass negative command ACLs by using abbreviations. For example, if the ACL denied "whoami", an attacker could execute the command by typing "w" or "who".
*   **Profile Overwrite:**  When using negative ACLs (starting with '!'), profiles could overwrite these entries due to the code not distinguishing between negative ACLs and 'not found' scenarios.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Command Execution:** An attacker could execute commands that they were explicitly denied access to through the defined ACLs.
*   **Potential for Privilege Escalation:** By bypassing command restrictions, an attacker might gain elevated privileges or perform actions they are not intended to.
*   **Compromised Security:** The vulnerability undermines the intended security controls provided by command ACLs.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** Exploitation occurs through the `bconsole`, which is typically accessed over a network.
*   **Command Abbreviation:** The attacker uses command abbreviations to bypass restrictions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to bconsole:** The attacker must have network access to a Bareos Director's `bconsole` interface.
*   **Valid User Credentials:** The attacker needs to have valid user credentials that allow them to connect to `bconsole`.
*   **Awareness of Command Abbreviations:** The attacker must be aware of the command abbreviations to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in Bareos versions 23.0.4, 22.1.6, and 21.1.11.
*   The fix involves checking the full command string against the ACL rather than just the abbreviated input.
*   The fix also addresses the handling of negative ACLs in profiles by introducing three ACL checking states (positive match, negative match, no match).
*   The patch also adds the ACL directive `!*all*` to deny all commands, which was previously only achievable through the regex `!.*`.
*   The CVE description mentions CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation), which aligns with the vulnerability where the input (abbreviated command) was not properly validated/normalized before being checked against the ACLs.
* The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 score of 8.8, indicating a high severity.
