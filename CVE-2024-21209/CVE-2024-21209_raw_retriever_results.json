Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows high privileged attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise MySQL Client. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized read access to a subset of MySQL Client accessible data. CVSS 3.1 Base Score 2.0 (Confidentiality impacts).
