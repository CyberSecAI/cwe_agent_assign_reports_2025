# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-21209

## Vulnerability Description
Vulnerability in the MySQL Client product of Oracle MySQL (component Client mysqldump). Supported versions that are affected are 8.4.2 and prior and 9.0.1 and prior. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows high privileged attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise MySQL Client. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized read access to a subset of MySQL Client accessible data. CVSS 3.1 Base Score 2.0 (Confidentiality impacts). CVSS Vector (CVSS3.1/AVN/ACH/PRH/UIR/SU/CL/IN/AN).

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-21209:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The content from both Oracle and NetApp explicitly mentions CVE-2024-21209 and relates it to a vulnerability in the MySQL client. The provided text from NetApp also includes the specific CVSS vector, confirming relevance.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a flaw within the MySQL Client itself, specifically versions up to 8.4.2 and 9.0.1. The Oracle advisory mentions "MySQL Client" as the component affected.
- The NetApp advisory states "MySQL Client versions through 8.4.2 and through 9.0.1 are susceptible to a vulnerability".
- There is no further technical detail of the root cause in this document, but rather how this vulnerability manifests in different products.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   The vulnerability allows for unauthorized read access to a subset of data accessible by the MySQL Client. The official Oracle advisory references this CVE in relation to MySQL.
-  NetApp specifies the vulnerability results in "unauthorized read access to a subset of MySQL Client accessible data."

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

-   Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain unauthorized read access to sensitive data handled by the affected MySQL Client.
-   NetApp clarifies the impact: "Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized read access to a subset of MySQL Client accessible data."

**5. Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector is related to the network as NetApp and Oracle refer to the component being the "MySQL Client"

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The CVSS vector of `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N` from the NetApp advisory provides further insight:
    - **AV:N (Network):** The attack can be performed over a network.
    - **AC:H (High):** The attack complexity is high, suggesting that the attacker needs specialized skills or specific conditions to carry out the exploit.
    - **PR:H (High):** The attacker needs high privileges to perform the attack, suggesting the attacker has already compromised some part of the system.
    - **UI:R (User Interaction Required):** The vulnerability requires some level of user interaction.
    - **S:U (Unchanged):** The scope of the vulnerability is unchanged.
    - **C:L (Low):** The impact on confidentiality is low.
    - **I:N (None):** The impact on integrity is none.
    - **A:N (None):** The impact on availability is none.

**Summary of Findings:**

This CVE is related to an information disclosure vulnerability in the MySQL Client.  The vulnerability can be exploited over the network if a high privileged user interacts with the client, allowing attackers to read sensitive data. Both Oracle and NetApp are aware of this issue and provide patches for affected products.

**Additional Notes:**

-   The Oracle document is a Critical Patch Update advisory, covering many CVEs and products, providing context and highlighting the importance of patching.
-   NetApp's advisory specifically lists affected and unaffected products, showing that the MySQL Client vulnerability impacts certain products only.
-   Both sources strongly recommend applying patches to mitigate the risk of exploitation.
