The vulnerability description and the CVE reference content both explicitly mention a heap-based buffer overflow. Therefore, the more specific CWE-122 is chosen over its parent, CWE-119.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe122[\"CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    \n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe122 primary\n    class cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of boundary check** when deriving the size of `tmp` which leads to a **heap-based buffer overflow** and can lead to potential remote code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description and CVE reference links explicitly state that a **heap-based buffer overflow** exists in the Assimp library. The root cause is the **lack of boundary check** between the size of `vertices` and `(*it).entries.size()`. This allows an attacker to write beyond the allocated buffer.\n\nThe primary CWE is CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) because it is explicitly mentioned in the vulnerability description and CVE reference links content summary. It is also at the Variant level of abstraction, which is preferred. The CVE reference links content summary says, \"Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).\"\n\nCWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) was considered as a more general classification, but CWE-122 is more specific and accurately reflects the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe
